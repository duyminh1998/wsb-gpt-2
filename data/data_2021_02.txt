Title: $VRT (Vertiv) the 5G/datacenter breakout play you should look at. Their Honeywell partnership is paying off huge.
$VRT is in full on breakout territory and it's getting literal walls of non stop news talking about their products daily. 

They are a datacenter/5g play [that partnered with Honeywell in October](https://www.barrons.com/articles/vertiv-is-parterning-with-honeywell-on-data-centers-its-stock-looks-promising-51602898166) to reduce power consumption of datacenters (they do a shit ton more with power mgmt but this is the huge shift)

Their next quarterly/annual [looks insane from projections.](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/vertiv-stock-breaks-out-expects-accelerating-eps-growth/)

 &gt; Digital Infrastructure Stock Vertiv Breaks Out ***Expecting 440% Q4 Growth***

&gt;***With estimates calling for 833% earnings growth for 2020,*** data center and communication network technology leaderVertiv(VRT) has powered up a new breakout.

This is a $7 billion company with 20k employees reporting *massive financials* coming up.

Title: $OSK (Oshkosh) to Infinity and Beyond (Part 1) 
I will be writing a series of DD posts for OSK. I have included TLDRs at the beginning of the post because I know we are all illiterate and lazy autists.

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor of any sort. This is my opinion, and it should not be taken as the word of God. Full disclosure, I am also fucking retarded, and it is better if you listen to a monkey and the apes than myself.

TLDR (Full Series): Oshkosh is a boomer company with the Pilot, Rocket, and Jet Fuel to take off to infinity and beyond. It has the resources allowing it to dominate in its current market and propel it to the hottest market of them all (EV). It has a small downside, but its upside is so massive that the green dildo will tear my ass apart.

TLDR (Part 1): Oshkosh has excellent management in place with a great track record not only maintaining market share in its current sectors. It has grown every year since CEO has been put in place except for the Covid year. The OSK team has been working hard to get into the electric commercial vehicle space, and it looks promising.

Oshkoshs Pilot will navigate us through the Stars and to the end of the Universe.

Oshkosh is a manufacturing conglomerate that provides products to access equipment, defense, fire &amp; emergency, and commercial sectors. It was founded in 1917. It is a business that has been around longer than the boomers we know in our lives. Since it has survived multiple recessions and depressions, it will not be going anywhere.

The CEO of the company is Wilson R Jones, and he has been with the company since 2005 as general manager and in other roles. He has been the President/CEO since 2016, and the company has seen growth year after year. This guy is like a fucking wizard that only knows how to grow. The company did take a hit in 2020, and so did basically any companies that didnt facilitate stay at home orders and the pain of Covid (eg. Zoom). 

During Wilsons tenure, the stock price of OSK went from around $30 to $100. This growth in stock price isnt just due to the markets being hotter than my neighbor next door. The revenue of OSK from 2016-2019 went from 6.28B  to 8.38B, and the EBIT of OSK went from $367M to $805M. During 2020 the revenue dropped to 6.82B, and the EBIT dropped to $406M. The company took a dip, but are we really going to hold that against him? He has a track record of performing, but you cant do anything if there is a black swan event. ([Financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OSK/financials?p=OSK))

Wilson and the OSK team arent satisfied with its current business sectors. They have been building relationships and joint ventures to dominate the commercial EV space. Their notable partners entering the commercial EV space are [FORD](https://www.trucks.com/2018/03/06/oshkosh-ford-usps-mail-truck/) and [Microvast](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210204005668/en/Oshkosh-Corporation-partners-with-Microvast-to-strengthen-electrification-capabilities). Their first mission is to swoop in and steal the USPS contract from Workhorse, like how my wifes boyfriend stole my wife away from me. I hate that fucker. I will talk more about this later on.

The management team has a strong track record, and they are only looking up and beyond just the moon. They will navigate us through the stars and into another galaxy.

In the next post, I will talk more about the valuation given to OSK and why it is a steal even if they didnt plan on providing electric commercial vehicles for USPS.

Positions: OSK (4/16 $115 Call &amp; 4/16 $125 Call), ELY, SBUX, T, GME

Title: BlackBerry is NOT a Meme Stock
It seems like people are finally starting to realize that BlackBerry, in fact, **is NOT a meme stock.**

You might ask, why is that? Well, here are a few of their partnerships and products that they're developing (and have *already* developed):

\- Partnership with Amazon: On December 1st, [BB announced a multi-year agreement ](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform#:~:text=OverviewContact%20Us-,AWS%20and%20BlackBerry%20Join%20Forces%20to%20Accelerate,New%20Intelligent%20Vehicle%20Data%20Platform&amp;text=SEATTLE%2C%20WA%20and%20WATERLOO%2C%20ON,%2C%20Amazon%20Web%20Services%2C%20Inc.)with AWS, which is Amazons cloud service business. The agreement plans to develop and market BlackBerry's Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY. BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud. Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences.

* Partnership with Baidu: On January 25, BB announced the [expansion](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology) of its strategic partnership with [Baidu](http://iv.baidu.com/), whose high-definition maps will run on the [QNX Neutrino Real-time](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-neutrino-rtos) Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of [GAC Group](https://www.gac-motor.com/) (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.). The milestones build on the companys [January 2018](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/blackberry-and-baidu-partnering-to-accelerate-connected-and-autonomous-vehicle-technology) agreement to make BlackBerry QNX's industry-leading operating system (OS) the foundation for Baidu's Apollo autonomous driving open platform.
* BlackBerry QNX: BlackBerry is entering into the auto industry by using their QNX real-time operating system that is already built into over 175 million vehicles today and is already being used by automakers like Audi, BMW, Subaru, Volkswagen, GM, Toyota, and Honda. NVIDIA is even building its AI self-driving platform off of BlackBerrys QNX technology.
* BlackBerry IVY: [In addition to the QNX](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/investors-overreacting-blackberry-deal-with-amazon/) Operating System, their partnership with AWS allows them to store all of this vehicle data through BlackBerry Ivy, which is a cloud-based software platform that allows these automakers to view data and insights for their vehicles.
* BlackBerry Spark: Another major service that BlackBerry offers is its Unified Endpoint Security, which is a comprehensive security approach to endpoint security that is essential to protect against and remediate cyber threats while providing visibility across all endpoints. Through their UES, they plan on improving **cross-platform visibility, cyber threat prevention, and remediation,** while **simplifying administration.**

**Okay, so why is this important?**

1. BlackBerry QNX was created to expand and improve autonomous driving vehicles and is currently being used in over 175 *million* vehicles.
2. BlackBerry IVY helps these automakers (Audi, BMW, Ford, etc) view data and insights on their vehicles. This means that if there is a recall on a vehicle, even like a problem with the sensors, **the automakers can find that issue much faster and quite possibly even fix it through a software update.**
3. They are REVOLUTIONIZING the automobile industry because of these two products. \*\*In the future, we could see a shift from hardware-driven vehicles to software-defined vehicles.\*\*
4. Not only are they focusing on this, but they also have successfully created cybersecurity software that received the **HIGHEST score in the industry for the Enterprise** [**Unmanaged/BYO use case**](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/09/blackberry-achieves-highest-score-in-gartner-critical-capabilities-report-for-unmanaged-byo-use-case)**.**

Gartner Research (who published the study) even placed BlackBerry higher than VMWare, IBM, and MSFT basically signaling that their products and services are better than their competitors. In fact, NONE of BlackBerry's customers that use BlackBerry Guard were affected by the SolarWinds hack. And the stock price is still $12.

**The Sobering Part of this DD:**

After taking a look at their balance sheet, I can agree with the skeptics that theyre not raking in a ton of money right now, but anyone can see that their current balance sheet makes the company appear to be undervalued, especially when compared to their competitors.

I mean, based on this information ALONE, the price of the stock should be much higher than it is right now. BlackBerry's current market cap is around $7 billion, with its competitors like Palantir, a software company that Im sure youve heard other YouTubers talk about, hovering at 60 billion. And funny enough, Palantir is also focusing their software on electric vehicles and cybersecurity, just like BlackBerry. **If BlackBerry had the same market cap as Palantir, its stock price would be $110.**

**Final Thoughts:**

Heres what the skeptics dont realize though. They dont realize that BB is still very focused on product development and customer acquisition, and that boomers probably still think its a phone company. Well, its not.

With their partnership with Amazon, Baidu, their UES and UEM product known as BlackBerry Spark, BlackBerry IVY, and their QNX operating system for vehicles, it seems like the market is not correctly pricing in BlackBerrys **future growth**.

Maybe one day if BlackBerry receives the same amount of hype that Palantir is getting right now, maybe then itll be taken much more seriously. **But only, once people realize that its not a meme stock.**

Title: DD on the Commodity SuperCycle and How To Get The Most  Tendies With Oil Company Penny Options KMI (Kinder Morgan Inc) &amp; EPD (Enterprise Products Partners)
Hi fellow autists,

Your wife's boyfriends' (multiple I know you know) favorite contemporary art dealer is back with another DD on the commodity super cycle and the most may be in sight with oil company penny options in KMI (Kinder Morgan Inc) and EPD (Enterprise Products Partners).

What is a commodity super cycle?

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-10/j-p-morgan-sees-commodity-supercycle-already-kicking-off](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-10/j-p-morgan-sees-commodity-supercycle-already-kicking-off?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;cmpId=google)

It's the rise of many physical commodity prices (such as those of food, oil, metals, chemicals, fuels, and the like) driven by various factors, but this COVID one is mostly by the stimulus spending and a weaker US dollar and the parabolic growth being observed in the East led by China where we see demand above 2020 levels.

This new "roaring 20s" will be accompanied by easy monetary and fiscal policy (more ), a weak US dollar, and stronger inflation, all supportive for commodity prices. (Yes, I repeated what I said because it is important)

And why Oil? Besides the obvious reason of Saudi did an output cut and raised prices on the crude. I personally think another reason is because we have put so much emphasis on renewable energy like Solar and Hydrogen, but we ignored the basic scientific fact that in order for a total energy replacement and revolution to happen, it will take at least another 20-50 years! So oil will still be around and coexist alongside the solar the hydrogen and all kind of other good stuff fancy energy!

[https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/oil-and-gas/our-insights/energy-2050-insights-from-the-ground-up](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/oil-and-gas/our-insights/energy-2050-insights-from-the-ground-up)

And oil companies have seen some rebound, but they are far from the pre COVID level, and if the commodity super cycle is happening (it is already happening, go check the oil companies tickers today) as explained by everyone's favorite market guru Marko Kolanovic from JPM, then I personally think we will very likely see oil companies going parabolic across the board as the major funds that have made huge profits from tech and renewable energy to cycle some of the profit into the oil which needed some tendie love and most importantly it is undervalued.

Out of all oil companies, I personally think KMI (Kinder Morgan Inc) and EPD (Enterprise Products Partners) will benefit most fabulously from this energy cycle. Why? Because besides the fact that both KMI and EPD are oil industry first-team relatively large market cap players, their option prices are very reasonable for a good trade if the super cycle takes off with a rocket engine.

Let's let the data speak:

KMI (Kinder Morgan Inc) is trading at $14.77, market cap $33.43B. KMI pre COVID crash high price was $22.16 on 02/19/2020. KMI $20 call 03/19/21 is asking for only $0.03!

EPD (Enterprise Products Partners) is trading at $21.76, market cap $47.50B. EPD pre COVID crash high price was $26.22 on 02/20/2020. EPD $26 call 03/19/21 is asking for only $0.06!

Kinder Morgan and Enterprise Products are what I find as large enough market cap, so they will not be too easy to dilute shares, and their OTM options for 03/19/21 and later dates are priced very, very well.

For me, these are the type of options trades to get  tendies, and this super cycle will have large funds coming in hoards and get on this oil sector rocket!

TLDR: Commodity SuperCycle is happening. Penny options from oil companies such as KMI (Kinder Morgan Inc) and EPD (Enterprise Products Partners) will take off.

Title: Exposing Sundial growers, ticker SNDL
 Please put up with my smooth brain analysis, here. Like many of you, I consider myself a connoisseur and producer of modern aut. I am autist in my own right, and as such I have spent hours looking over the shady financial reporting of this shady company.

Of course, I am in no way certified to give financial advice to anyone. I am simply concerned that this company, if it is really fraudulent, is going to destroy investor's savings, and I think it's only fair that I express these concerns.

I'll try to keep this concise, and not miss any details, because there is a lot going on here, and it really does get complicated.

Fair warning, my decision has been to invest in some put options on February 11th before the price started dropping, and it's up to you whether you want to as well. I give no advice on such an investment, but I personally think I made the best choice, and I know for a fact that their financials do not add up, so this is more to call attention to anyone who might be convinced to invest just how bad of a decision that would be...

Here are some reasons:

**A. OBVIOUS SHILLS**

I won't name names, but obvious shills like [u/Masternewworldorder](https://www.reddit.com/u/Masternewworldorder/) have been trying to pump up the stock price through a social media campaign and ride the coattails of the GME debacle. I would not just simply post this guy's name on here if I had any other way to show how all 18 posts on his account are about hyping Sundial using the GME fiasco as a model for doing so. He even mentions GME, calling SNDL the "next" SNDL. To you, buddy, if you're doing what everybody knows you're doing, and the SEC finds out, you and those you work for or with will probably be arrested. Not only that, but his page clearly breaks a few rules on the sub. Pump &amp; Dump most likely, advertisement, market manipulation, etc.

If you're just riding the hype wagon, you should really choose another company to hype up. If I'm correct in my math, they don't have the funds to operate through the quarter, nor can they get a loan to continue operations. I'll discuss their lies about their debt at the bottom of the page. I'll just say for now, it's my belief that they are either doing a pump and dump, or using share capital to have enough cash that they can file for bankruptcy.

**B. DISGRACEFUL FINANCIALS**

Financial reports must comply with a ton of SEC and FTC laws about documents that they have to file. This is to protect those who would wish to invest their money so as to be protected from the sort of activities that would destroy them, and any trust in the stock market that they had. Maybe I'm cynical, but that last part is the most important. SEC wants trust, because then they have a functional system.

A company that is traded on an American stock exchange must fulfill certain requirements regarding their financial reports, that usually allow for an exception in the case of international filers, but Canada is very similar in this regard, though perhaps notable from this stock, that's not the case at all \[1\]

1. Their most up to date report shows **$500 million** in share capital with **$70 million equity.** (I believe that's Canadian $)
2. leveraged against the share capital is a **$500 million** accumulated deficit, up **$140 million** from the year before. Coincidentally, their **debt** obligations are **down $140 million** from the year before as well. This suggests they are using issued stock and general market manipulations to pay off their debt. They say that the issuance of more stock is for a few things, depending on which report you read. I can't find them all, but trust me, [https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0001766600&amp;type=&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=include&amp;start=0&amp;count=40](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0001766600&amp;type=&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=include&amp;start=0&amp;count=40), it's in here somewhere. They say it's for purchasing of new properties, or maybe operation activities, but they never clearly state that they are paying off their debt with the new stock. I don't know if that's illegal or not, but it's definitely untrustworthy.
3. For the 9 month period from January 1st, 2020 to September 30th 2020, they had **$12 million in revenue**, which cost them **$10 million to sell**, but they also lost **\~ $20 million to inventory obsolescence**, and **$60 million to asset impairment**. As an investor, I would like to know why that happened, but their reporting makes absolutely no mention of it in their section **Risk Factors** on all **F-3** filings \[2\]. They may not have to include that, but again, you should really be given the opportunity to find out, and any company acting with the foresight to know stockholder trust is important - any company who wants to succeed - will make these things abundantly clear.

**C. LETTER FROM THE AUDITOR**

This is the icing on the cake, and which verifies to me that there is so much more going on here than I could even understand. The auditor is paid by the company to look at their financials thoroughly to see if the condensed info meets standards, and fairly describes the company's information to the potential stockholders.

This auditor has time and again given them the same letter more or less, stating that their financials do not show that **the company has been acting in breach of their debt covenant**, which is the most evidence of a serious issue here. They also say that various other issues in Sundial's reporting gives them concern that **the company should not, and probably will not be able to continue operating** the way that they are \[3\]. This is all I need to know, really. And why any speculative raise in their market capitalization on the stock market gives me serious concern about the current state of our economic system. It's examples like these which destroy investor confidence, and lead to seriously tough times. Shorting this position is **not just profitable**, it's necessary to **save the soundness of our economy**, in my opinion.

**D. SUSPICIOUS REASONS FOR FULFILLMENT OF DEBTS**

If securities on an exchange are linked to the equity of a firm that goes bankrupt and cannot operate, then all that money goes out of investors hands, and into the hands of debtors, or is liquidated and given to the preferred stock holders.

Luckily for the executives and majority shareholders of Sundial Growers, Inc, they have a tiny little clause hidden in one of their reports which says that all liquidated funds must first be given to preferred stock holders before any is given to issued common stock traded on any exchange \[4\].

This is important, because they have clearly stated that **they can issue indefinite numbers of preferred and common stock**, and that **preferred stock gets first right** in the case of liquidation. Essentially, they can use the extra stock issuance to dilute costs and trick investors into thinking **EPS** is getting closer to that **above 0** marker (total earnings continues to drop further every statement), while also separately securing any cash left by issuing more preferred stock to themselves upon liquidation so that you, the investor, **get absolutely nothing** while they get any proceeds from going bankruptcy, possibly even millions.

**E. WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE COMPANY EVEN**

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766600/000110465920114508/a20-32923\_1sc13g.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766600/000110465920114508/a20-32923_1sc13g.htm)

Some guy named **Ryan Dunfield**, who is mentioned nowhere else in their financials, received 100,000,000 shares in preferred stock for absolutely zero dollars in cost to him, well, actually, it's that Ryan Dunfield gets **25 million share**s,\[redacted company name\]**,**\[redacted company name\]**, and 1920576 ALBERTA LTD** all get shares as well. However, these are 3 companies of which **Ryan Dunfield is the president and/or CEO**. Ryan Dunfield got **1/10 of all stocks** available, not to mention voting power from these stocks, without paying any money for them, This was filed very recently too, It was filed after the last known financial report on September 30th. I haven't calculated all of the other people's issuance of preferred stock either, but this is definitely suspect to me. These sorts of dealings are **being done all the time by this company**, but they drown out the sec filings by naming **every single filing under the exact same document name**, so it's damn near impossible to keep track of any of it.

**F. NUMBERS DONT ADD UP**

This by itself is really pretty common and not signs of impending doom, but it's also convenient that they just issued common stock to fill the company with cash, and actually **did away with all of their debt.** If that is to be believed (sorry, I can't find any proof in their filings), then they are a rarity among companies to have done so **and maintained a $600 million cash reserve**. Not to mention that the **$500 million accumulated deficit**, **the $100 million total debt** and **accounts payable**, along with a **$90 million operating loss** all is somehow accounted for by **$18 million in financing income** (stock issuance I presume) before September 30th of last year, and supposedly **$100 million in stock issuance** if you read any related news, and less than **$200 million in illiquid assets**. Honestly, I don't know how these numbers can make turn **$20 million or so cash into $600 million cash in 3 months**.

However they managed to pull that off this year, I'm pretty sure that they will continue to leverage this as a deficit against their Share capital. If that's the case, they now have **$600 million share capita**l with **$690 million in deficit** leveraged against that.

I'm not sure if anyone is aware of this, but if you owe a bank money, you can't simply say "Sorry, this isn't actually a debt, it's a deficit". It doesn't work that way, and **reporting it that way is serious fraud**. They may not actually be prosecuted for this fraud, but it still exists, and it is damaging to those who would invest in it.

**G. SHOW THE INSTITUTIONS AND THE SEC WE CAN HANDLE OURSELVES**

The institutions have not invested anything in this company, and I suspect it has everything to do with their financials. I bet you if a company with a large amount of institutional ownership operated the way this company does, then the SEC would be their to protect the institutions so fast.

Instead, it's left up to the little guys, who don't have enough money to pay Treasurers from the shady San Francisco political bubble $800k in speaking fees, to fend for themselves. We all take the most risk in the market because we're targeted by scammers, immeasurably larger competition, and indifferent regulators. In my opinion, this **short position against Sundial would be exactly what we need to show regulators what it's like to do their job.**

By the way, I'm pretty suspicious about the timing of this sudden increase in cash, given that I'm pretty sure tax season, and financial reporting season are very soon. Both of which would help secure them a new loan to save their ass. I wonder why a struggling company would want their book values to look a little better with this.

**H. MAGIC NUMBER**

If all of this is lost on you, at least realize that my they potentially have a $690 million deficit, I'm my math is right.

69

What else do you need?

Title: DD: Listen up retards the future is shroomstock
Attention retards, the future is in psychedelic research companies

Im in the field neuroscience and pharmaceutical industry. Listen up guys youre probably wondering hmmm why should I keep and eye out in these stocks. Well the answer is big pharma is going to buy them out after they compete with their current products and win. The entire sector of anti psychotics, anti depressants ssris, mood suppressors, maois, anti anxiety medication, benzos, addiction medication, and Adhd medication are going to be taken out by these companies, and then bought into the big pharma borg. 

The evidence is in the scientific studies, which show that these psychedelic and other illicit compound research companies have the most effective cutting edge mental illness treatment on the planet. Ketamine for example is the worlds most effective short term anti depressant. Magic mushrooms are shown to be the worlds most effective treatment at treating treatment resistant depression. Ibogaine is the worlds most effective anti addiction drug for heroin, with 77% of users in one study not relapsing when they didnt return to their old enviornment. Lsd is shown to be incredibly promising to treat alcohol addiction. Alcoholics Anonymous started out using it actually. Mdma is considered the worlds most promising drug for treated PTSD AND CPTSD. DMT is being used in new trials to treat depression as well with much success. 

The thing all these stocks have in common is that companies such as mindmed compass pathways Numinus wellness and others are all researching and gaining patents on these drugs and developing new analogues to patent and sell for insane profits. The future of healthcare is in these drugs. Oh and the growth in this sectors huge. The sector is on track to hit 6.8 billion dollars marketshare in 2027. This is the next boom.
My Holdings are 50 shares CMPS 100 shares MMED.NE
TL/DR: Buy companies that do research on dmt ibogaine mdma ketamine lsd and mushrooms.

Title: I took a good look at the GME situation I belive the squeeze will come, I have more of a ED Educated Guess.
If you when all noticed the price of GME had been stable at or around 50, this stability is not a coincidence. Despite the best efforts by the HF they are unable to drive the price down further, in part thanks to everyone still holding and the market itself still belives that Game stop as a company will survive, gear up a new model, and make a comeback.
2. Even at $50 the shot sellers are deep in the red, if one sell another will and can POSSIBLY trigger a cascade of chain reactions that will drive the price of GME to the moon. Maybe not the mythical 30k or 50k but back to all time high or 1,000 (though 5000-1000 still possible). 

3. HF CANT SHOT FOREVER!! They will eventually break. THEY are counting on us being weak minded and so fucked up on instant gratification that we will sell. 

4. Instant gratification, stop It!! I have seen many people anxious wanting their money fast and now. Well things don't happen overnight.

5. I bought at 370 and bought more at 49.

6. There is no fucking way the short interest is at  74%, we can make these HG bleed for years if we have to. But I think we won't have to wait that long, we at wsb are human and fickle and many will sell but so are these HFs. It only takes one move on their part to set off a chain reaction.

7. A sharp drop in price is almost always preceded by a huge upturn.

Title:  QQQJ to rocket even more over the next two weeks 
TLDR: QQQJ will rocket over the next two weeks because some of its major companies like \*\*ETSY, ROKU, VIAC, TTD, ZS, BILI\*\* will be reporting earnings starting next week.  


I know a lot of you have got burned chasing meme stocks (GME, PLTR, AMC and weed) and you're looking for something "safer" to play now. Well, look no further than call options on QQQJ. It is attractive because:

1) Unlike QQQ which is overweight in big Tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials.

2) If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside in QQQJ than QQQ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ.

3) For options (the reason why 99% of you are reading this anyway), IV is still relatively low. Show me another ETF that has gone up 30% since November with IV in the 25-30% region. Premiums on QQQJ are ridiculously cheap. ARKK, ICLN, MJ etc have all gone up higher but check their IV and premiums.

4) My favorite reason for being in QQQJ: it is fairly consistent. On deep red days, it doesn't tank too much and on hulk-dick green days, it doesn't rocket like ARKK. It just reliably goes up gradually.

5) Why will it rocket even more in the next two weeks? Well the following companies will be reporting earnings: ROKU (18 Feb), TTD (18 Feb), ETSY (25 Feb), VIAC (24 Feb), BILI (24 Feb), ZS (25 Feb)

6) Call me conspiratorial but I believe market makers and hedge funds have been using WSB for their pump and dump schemes since we blew up. It's not impossible but it is harder to pump and dump an ETF. So I believe that makes QQQJ safer and more robust than some of the other plays circulating on here.

I predicted in December than QQQJ will hit $35 by March and bought a lot of June $35c options. My thesis was that once the constituent companies in the ET reported good, in some cases blowout earnings and provide optimistic guidance for the upcoming year (due to the vaccine ramp up and an actual competent administration), it should rocket up. However, looking at its current trajectory, it will hit $35 and surpass it by next week!!

Just something to consider as you chase meme stocks and ETFs with ludicrous IV and premiums. Have a nice day and make lots of tendies, brothers and sisters!  


My recommendation: Get options expiring in June and September with strike price between $35 and $40. Park your money there, delete Robinhood and check back in 3 months. But as always, do your own DD folks and be skeptical of everything you read (including this!!)

Title: GEVO is nice
I say DD but Im not doing DD for you autists, dont trust me, go look into this yourself.

That said heres why GEVO is nice and Im holding it for the long term.

GEVO are going to be making carbon neutral jet fuel. Pretty nifty coz Im pretty sure people are already paying extra to airlines to fly lower carbon flights, and Im sure governments all around the world will be heavily incentivising low carbon footprint fuels.

Theyve secured funding now for their Net-Zero 1 project which will use entirely renewable energy sources to refine 45MGPY of bio-fuels which have a net zero carbon footprint. They already have in place contracts to sell 48MGPY at 1.5 billion over the life of the contracts. After this theyre looking to introduce projects net zero 2 and 3 as well as a bunch of other cool, useful shit that lets us revolutionise the world without reinventing planes and shit.

Also the companies co-founder was recently added to Joe Bidens science team which was pretty big news. 

Im in with 139 at avg of $4.5

Check it out if you like, Im not your dad (yet). Just dont fuck with it this is a real genuine value business and I dont want pump and dumpers fucking around and wrecking it.

Title: BMBL: I Hate the Stock
TLDR: yeah you can laugh about how I'm a salty neckbeard because no one swipes right on my pic with a fedora, sword and anime body pillow of [Kanna Kamui](https://www.google.com/search?q=kanna+kamui), but the $15B valuation is not going to last.

Options start trading 3 days after IPO, so with the holiday it's this coming Tuesday 2/16

**The Financials:** From Jan 2020 to September 2020 (I mean, like last year, the year of basically the highest possible growth as everyone was stuck at home)

* Total Revenue of $376.6 million
* Bumble App Revenue of $231.5 million
* Badoo App and Other Revenue of $145.1 million
* Net loss of $(84.1) million, respectively, with a net loss margin of 22.3%
* Adjusted EBITDA of $98.9 million, representing Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 26.3%.
* Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.0 million
* Free Cash Flow of $(4.7) million

We can't use P/E because there is no earnings. The net loss margin &gt;20% is quite impressive for a company that really shouldn't have any expenses (not that much advertising... it's all by word of mouth really). That total valuation to revenue is 40x. Facebook's is only around 9x. 

**Gamification of meeting people**: This is where r/wsb and Grindr gets it right. There's a certain addictiveness of these two because you never know when you're going to hit a 200 bagger with OTM calls on TSLA or get a 2 bagger on your face (both great success). When using all kinds of dating apps, especially Bumble, there are a lot of speed limits. 

That speed limit? Well, their tagline: women responding first. I've asked my online sister about this and she says most women will not answer first because after the initial high of matching, they come back to normal realization much sooner. Men would always want to initiate and keep the conversation because of possible tits, but women would think "oh, why do I want to meet this guy again? He's not going to provide for me financially, and I can just use a lightsaber." 

**Diminishing returns**: All the dating apps aren't in the matching business. They're in the data business. Data is driven by continuous activity, even if it's by only a small portion of users. Because of the above restriction, they're severely limiting activity. Most users are men, and by cutting out a large base of activity generation (even the possibility of saying hi and dreaming), Bumble is limiting activity and time spent on the app. It's like r/wsb. Most retards who got burned by GME aren't going to come back, no matter how good the DD will be. 

**Social Networking?**: No. LinkedIn is already good enough to polish my helmet. I personally don't want anyone to find me professionally through a dating website. This is one of the arguments to its high valuation, but honestly it's dead on arrival. 

Also, why would I need to meet someone? Mom knows how crispy to fry my tendies. She always gives me the tendies, and sometimes I give one back to her in return.

Title: Diffusion Pharmaceuticals- potential upside of over 150%, and a good short play
Diffusion Pharmaceuticals is a company that specializes in therapies to enhance the diffusion of oxygen to tissues with low oxygen levels, today they announced an agreement with H.C. Wainwright &amp; Co. and sold $10 million worth of their common stock to them for $1.025. This caused the price of the stock to drop to around 1.15 from ~1.50. Furthermore because they raised this much money they probably will be using it to develop their oxygen therapies further or already have had a breakthrough in their therapies which caused them to get a large investment. This could lead the stock to go higher than it was previously. I see it as a good long term and short term play and some stock forecast even see the stock going up to 3.50 a potential upside of over 150%. 
Even if it doesnt reach this 3.50 potential I see it going back to 1.30-1.50 soon

https://www.diffusionpharma.com


https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/diffusion-pharmaceuticals-announces-10-million-225400718.html


TL;DL: stock down because they sold it at a low price to raise funds, but it will go back up

Title: NrdRages Friday DD: Theres still one meme stock thats not dead yet. I present to you The Curious Case of Benjamin Butto....err Black Berry. ($BB)
Listen up reta.....err, I mean memelords.  I know weve all moved on from the meme era into the weed era (and  hopefully people stick around that one due to the fundamentals for a  while, but if not....) and soon to be a redux of the vehicle era, but  theres one meme stonk we need to have a real, honest heart-to-heart  about (and hey, it even ties into cars): Lets talk about Blackberry  ($BB) 

First,  lets get some misconceptions out of the way: Blackberry was never a  short squeeze stonk, even though it ended up getting roped in with the  other squeezers we were denied squozing  because of Wall Street cheating. A lot of people thought it was and  thats simply not the case. Blackberry was, is, and always will be, a  phoenix rising from the ashes story, nostalgia peppered with  functionality. You know, kind of like how you sometimes go watch some  classic porn to beat off to and dont stop to think about the fact that  the actress is now in her 60s and probably has super saggy tiddies. 

Next  misconception: Its not a Boomer mobile phone company. They dont  make phones anymore  phones that are branded with their logos are made  by another company that pays licensing for the logo and some of the  patents. Blackberry sold all their mobile patents months ago. 

Third misconception: No matter how much we ask,  theyre never changing their name back to Research in Motion so that we  can talk about Rim-jobs. Sorry, just isnt going to be a thing. 

So  what are they? Its simple really: Theyre now an enterprise level  software security company. When you think about it, its not such a big  pivot, given that their security encryption in their heyday was so  powerful that they ended up having to set up offices in certain nations  because it was impossible to crack and ran afoul of certain  international laws. 

# Lets take a dive into the financials before we get into the story: 

At the time of this writing, BB is a 7 billion dollar  company with shares trading in the $12.50 range. Even after the meme  war collapse, theyre still worth double what they were when the ball  dropped in New York City with absolutely nobody watching in person and  everybody at home wondering why even Anderson Cooper was using an autotuner.  They generate a hair over a quarter billion dollars in revenue each  quarter over the last year and in 2020 had a negative EPS of about 32  cents a share as they retooled, though they trimmed that to .23 cents a  share for their last quarterly earnings report. They have about a  billion dollars in cash on hand and receivables, and they have about  half a billion dollars in debt. Its not a great fiscal outlook there,  but its certainly manageable for a growth company (which is what they  presently are). 

# Where do they make their money? 

Almost  half of their revenue is legacy income from selling endpoint management  and secure communications licensing. A third of their revenue comes  from licensing their patents. Oh, they also own Cylance, for you IT  help desk monkeys. 

That shits pretty boring, not gonna  lie. Your wifes boyfriend might find it interesting, but only because  he can use it to laugh at you that you know this shit. But the rest?  The rest is where things get interesting. Blackberry Radar is a fleet  management solution, and the most interesting thing is....well, for  that, we have to go back in time for a moment: 

# (Waynes World flashback/dream noises). 

July 29th,  2017. Las Vegas Nevada. 50,000 of the worlds most feared hackers  descend upon Sin City for a weekend of debauchery, drinking, and talking  about all the new and interesting ways they found to break shit or in  general cause chaos. A young hacker from Wisconsin positively stuns  everybody at a panel by revealing how it is that he found he could  effectively hack almost every late model vehicle on the road that  possessed connected features  from range and while the vehicles are in  motion  using.....music  theory. Its an absolutely stunning revelation, something matched only  by how terrifying the implications of it are. And all anybody needed  was a $300 RF modulation tool. Using this, he found he could take  control of every mass produced  car on the market except those made by Volkswagen Group and Tesla, and  those only because they had randomized frequencies they used. This guy  fucked. This process was so dangerous that, for one of the only times  in DefCons history, they didnt publish the how-to publicly. Oh, and a  team from a then relatively unknown EV company in China called $NIO won  the car hacking capture the flag tournament in less dramatic fashion.  Something had to be done. 

# Enter Blackberry 

Ill  spare you all the things that have happened since then, but what you  need to know is this: Blackberry came up with a solution to defend  against this and a myriad of other problems (not to mention Europoor  compliance in the form of ISO 26262) not to mention autonomous security  - and their security software suite (QNX) is now on almost every new  car rolling off a factory line today. This software is also critical  for EVs, because it controls battery management ECUs (thats the shit  that makes it so you dont have to drop 10 grand on a new power plant every 2 years). Or, for those of you with IQs of 60: Computer make car gooder. 

# OK, so thats cool. But how does this get me TENDIES, man? How much can these guys make? 

Theyre  coy about this and wont give hard numbers, but there are ways we can  estimate what theyre pulling. But to do that, we need to go back in  history again, and take a look at a stock nobody cares about 

# (More Waynes World noises) 

Enter:  Nuance Communications ($NUAN). Youve probably never heard of these  guys, but you and almost everybody you know has used their products at  some point. They used to be best known for their Dragon Naturally  Speaking software suite, which your grandparents who decided they were  too old to figure out how to use a fucking keyboard bought so that they  could talk to their computer and send you messages that you hated  getting unless it came with a 20 dollar  bill, but which they thought you cherished forever.  However, at some  point around 2010, IBM  whom the Nuance CEO at the time was close  friends with the management of, literally just \*gave\* about 125 patents  around voice recognition to Nuance thinking that they were worthless.  Nuance took these patents and  for a brief moment  became one of the  coolest techs on the planet, because their tech is what made Apples  Siri, Amazons Alexa, Microsofts Cortana, Samsungs whatever it was  called and a billion other voice recognition platforms work. That is,  until Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Steve Ballmer, and everybody else Nuance  was dumb enough to trust to let look under the hood of their secret  sauce and they all stole the IP and made their own platforms, leaving  Nuance rotting in a hole in the desert. But one of the really cool  things Nuance expanded into before they went full retard was  they bought a couple of companiesaround 2013 or so Tweddle and some  other company I cant be bothered to look up  and got into the  connected car space. At one point, Nuances Dragon Drive virtual  assistant was in every new car made by 9 of the worlds top 10 auto  makers.  

# OK, dude, my wifes boyfriend is asking me to bring him a beer. Can you speed this along? What does this matter? 

It  matters because we can look at what $NUAN was getting in licensing for  putting their virtual assistant in these vehicles, and use that data to  extrapolate an estimate of what $BB is getting for their software. With  just their 9 car makers at their back, they were generating over 300  million dollars a year  and that was almost a decade ago, and just for  something that would tell you where to pick up your Downs Syndrome  medication. Add a premium for security, include all the auto makers,  carry the one, smoke a bowl to help you concentrate, adjust for  inflation..... 

This  is a market worth about...oh, roughly 750 million dollars a year for  Blackberry on the conservative side once they actually start charging a  market rate for this product.  Right now, theyre adopting the same  go-to strategy Microsoft has been employing with Azure, which is to  basically GIVE it away in order to gain market share and penetration,  and then send Fat Tony to collect once the car maker is reliant on it. Plus  all the other stuff we already glossed over because its boring as  shit.  Applying the average multiple of earnings for cybersecurity  firms out there, their lack of competition in the space, etc. And you  come up with a market cap valuation target of....oh,  roughly between 45 and 50 billion dollars once theyre firing on all  cylinders. And they dont have to worry about Google or Apple throwing  10,000 engineers at this to make a competing product, because its just  not worth it to them, so theyre largely gonna get left alone.  

Or, by using maths....a  share price of somewhere in the neighborhood of $87.50. Give or take  10 bucks. Make it 15 to the downside, just to be safe. 

# Yeah man! Cool. So Im in. Its gonna go to that by like, Friday or something? 

An enterprise level cybersecurity company with a sub 10 billion dollar valuation is basically unheard of in this century.  But this is not a burn play where youre gonna  get 50% gains every day with no work. Its a company thats going to  have to melt up to that. It still wont be to that point this time next  year.  

BUT....that  doesnt mean it doesnt have a great story. It just means that this  isnt something you do a 0DTE YOLO on and expect to get something out  of. And making an Avengers meme about it isnt going to send it to the  moon. This is something you buy and stash in a musty corner of your  portfolio so you can tell your Boomer parents that youre being  responsible with your investing and you were just joking about betting  your inheritance on weekly FDs for shitty online dating sites where the women have to talk to your sorry ass first.  Oh, and itll make the lambo you buy with the money from this safer. 

Because I know it matters, here are 69 rockets so you apes understand what all this meant. 

.....no, there aren't going to be any rockets.  I lied. 

Disclosures/Positions: I am long $BB, holding 100,000 shares @ $7.67 average and another 5000 January 2022 8cs. 

All my love

Title: Pre-NASDAQ listing play on US Cannabis Industries.
If you're just now getting into weed stocks be aware, there massive untapped potential in US companies currently traded on the OTC market. With the SAFE/MORE act currently getting passes in congress and Schumer making moves towards legalization, US MSOs are getting closer than ever to being listed on NASDAQ and when institutional investors have access to the US cannabis industry... All hell breaks loose. The largest names right now are Green Thumb, Trulieve, Curaleaf, and Cresco Labs. No need to get smoked gambling on Canadian Cannabis companies, US MSOs have a huge advantage and are already established across the country for the moment legalization comes. I'm passing yall the boof on this one. Do with this information what you will. I currently have positions in Green Thumb and Curaleaf.  


tl;dr: US cannabis companies are on a massive discount on the OTC market, massive potential gains when they get listed on NASDAQ

Title: I received a lot of positive feedback on my ROXG DD yesterday, so I thought I would share my email response from their investor relations team regarding political risk in African Mining Operations.
Again, please note this is an investor relations team, who's job it is to inform but also encourage investors. I agree with his sentiment on African (region specific) mining and the risk levels but please do your own dd before purchasing mining stock which can be very volatile.  


&gt;Thu, Feb 11, 7:33 PM   
Hi \*\*\*\*\*\*,  
&gt;  
&gt;It is a question we receive a lot, so here are my candid, and somewhat long-winded, thoughts:  
&gt;  
&gt;These concerns typically are raised by North American investors versus UK based investors, which I believe at a base level is due to geography and familiarity: North American investors will willing invest in mining companies in South America, while UK investors prefer investing in Africa and shun South America.  
&gt;  
&gt;I have to say, after many years in this business, I am on the side of UK investors. South America has a long track record of governments imposing new royalties and taxation regimes (let alone nationalization) on mining, while Africa  or more importantly, the right regions of Africa  should be considered among the most desirable regions for investing in mining in the world.  
&gt;  
&gt;A key phrase above is the right regions in Africa, as for an investor to be apprehensive to invest in mining in Africa is almost akin to an investor saying they are apprehensive of investing in mining in the Americas. There is no doubt there are countries in Africa that are questionable, but West Africa has a long established history now of being very pro-mining. I believe it has been 40 years since one of the countries, Ghana, returned from a 15 year experiment of nationalization that failed as mining output cratered  as mining is a people-intensive business that requires skills and capital.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you look at the recent history, countries in West Africa like Burkina Faso, Mali, Cote dIvoire, and Senegal have profited immensely from mining and since adopting commercial mining codes that reflect internationally accepted standards (in Malis case 30 years ago), this has resulted in significant foreign investment in the gold sector and gold tax receipts to the governments. The fact is that mining is a critical backbone of these economies, and if you look at the history there is very little of what you see in South America. Governments, and more importantly, local communities are very welcoming of mining (done the right way by companies that adhere to first world environmental standards).  
&gt;  
&gt;In Burkina Faso, where our producing Yaramoko mine is, mining revenue contributes approximately 16% of the total government revenue. This is poor country that relies on the income of mining and the skills and career development that come with it. Generally in mining, for every $1 generated by mining an additional $3+ are generated elsewhere in the economy, so the impact of mining to these economies are even higher. Therefore, it stands to reason that these countries would not want to rock the boat  which is all fine and well when saying that  but you can look at their track records to see this is put into practice.  
&gt;  
&gt;Our Yaramoko mine, from initial drill hole to production, was 5 years. There is nowhere else in the world that you can see projects move ahead this quickly. Our next mine, Sgula, which will be coming online next year (\~4 years from initial resource) and which has the potential to more than double our production and cash flow  without having to raise a share since we can fund it from our operations  received its Environmental Approval in September last year and the Mining Permit in December. This will be one of the highest grade open pit mines in Africa, and as a testament to the government and local communities buy-in, the Government of Cote dIvoire (Ivory Coast) approved the mine in 8 months. This is not because we cut any corners, as we adhere to IFC Performance Standards and the Equator Principles, but the government and people want these projects. Notably, when we acquired the project in April 2019 from Newcrest, the mining minister of Burkina Faso wrote to their equal in Cote dIvoire to recommend they approve the acquisition, voicing their support for Roxgolda contribution towards socio-economic development in Burkina Faso.  
&gt;  
&gt;On a political front, both Burkina Faso and Cote dIvoire recently had elections in late 2020, with both incumbent retaining their seats. This means we have another 4 years in both countries until the next election cycle. Naturally, elections in Africa and West Africa always carry some headline risk, so getting these events behind us should alleviate some concerns from investors. However, not to keep hitting this point, but even political turmoil in West Africa has had little effect on mining in these countries. Look at Mali, which had a coup in August, and not one mining company has been affected, as Mali knows it is in the countrys best interest to keep the gold mines running.  
&gt;  
&gt;On a monetary policy front, these countries use the West Africa CFA Franc, which is pegged to the Euro, and the West African Economic and Monetary Union (an agreement among countries in West Africa) have aligned their fiscal and monetary policies and have an agreement to promote regional economic integration.  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally, the reason you want to look at West African miners once you accept the jurisdictional risk, is that the Birimian Gold Belt has been the most prolific region in the world for gold discoveries in the last 15 years. There has been the discovery of over 75 million ounces of gold in the past 15 years, with almost 50% located in Burkina Faso  and Cote dIvoire is considered to be underexplored historically which is why there has been a rush of investment there. We are in the right jurisdiction, and have the cash flow producing power to drive growth organically without needing to dilute shareholders. As Sgula moves forward, and investors start to recognize the impact this will have on our cash flows, we are confident our share price will step in line with our earnings growth. Meanwhile, we continue to drill away at Boussoura, which is in the heart of the Birimian Belt and has been returning intriguing results that have us now believing we have a 3rd project to put in our pipeline of development.  
&gt;  
&gt;Roxgold continues to trade at a discount to our peers, as the average investor still sees us as a single asset producer with the one mine in Burkina Faso. In the next 18 months, we will be multi-asset producer out of Burkina Faso and Cote dIvoire with an exceptional exploration portfolio in the right jurisdiction to move projects ahead quickly.  
&gt;  
&gt;Hope that was not too lengthy.  
&gt;  
&gt;Regards,

Title: $OPEN Opendoor DD  From a Realtor Industry Insider
Im a Realtor in one of the test markets for Opendoor (Charlotte) and I firmly believe that this company is going to go far.  They are going to completely disrupt and revitalize the real estate industry.  

A bit of background about me and my credentials for writing this Due Diligence: I have been a licensee since early 2013. My husband is real estate closing attorney . His office handles 300+ real estate closings per month with 4 offices and 18-20 full-time employees. 

My husband was not always a real estate closing attorney. Back in 2010  2015, his main bread and butter was handling foreclosure defense. He represented people who were facing foreclosure and helped them avoid it by delaying the process through the court system, helping them apply for obtain loan modifications or negotiating short sales with their lender. Back then, the market was still recovering from the 2008 crash and there were a lot of people who were upside down in their houses. They simply couldnt sell them and move on. They owed way more money than houses were selling for and had to convince the bank to allow them to sell the house. The fed bailed out the banks  by allowing short sales and taking a lesser payoff than what was originally lent out, but the process for getting them to agree to do so on an individual level was long, complicated and very difficult. As a Realtor, I assisted with this many times and listed dozens of short sales. During the markets in 2008-2014, this was a huge majority of houses.  Around 2015, the scales tipped back and the market, for the most part, was nearly recovered. Currently, there are no short sales. VERY rare, if so.

Currently, the market is Charlotte is such that inventory cannot keep up with the demand. I talked to a Realtor yesterday who was in the middle of a bidding war with 53 other offers on the table. It is common for most houses to get 20+ offers within hours of listing. Its an absolute bloodbath out there. 

To say that I understand this industry is an understatement. I know it in and out, up and down, left and right. I eat, sleep and dream in real estate and have for a long time.

iBuying is going to shift the entire landscape of how real estate is purchased. I am seeing it happen here now, in real time. So, let me explain

Realtors have always been the vehicle of connecting buyers and sellers to one another in the process of buying or selling a home. They hold the coveted keys to the castle. This current age of free data and knowledge with the internet  has slowly started to shift that power away from them over the past 20 years. The Association of Realtors has done an excellent job of protecting the industry over the past 2 decades, but technology is getting to the point where they wont be able to continue to do this in the way they have in the past. 

Only Realtors have access to MLS, however  MLS shares that data with online listing websites like Zillow and Realtor.com. Those websites then attract buyers in the market looking at property, they capture the data and then sell the data to the Realtors as leads. Its ironic, but Realtors have funded the vehicles that will be the end of their industry eventually. 

Every property listed on the MLS is usually listed with a Supra iBox that houses the keys for the house for showings. Only Realtors are allowed to hold the keys to these Supra boxes and everytime they are opened, that data is captured and stored. Opendoor has created their own system for lockboxes and showings. They have their own lockboxes. And anyone can download the app to their phone and access the Opendoor properties. Without a Realtor. 

In most situations, sellers list their home while they are still living in the property. They have to because until recently, there were only retail buyers who bought them and sellers needed the proceeds from their sale to buy their next house. Sellers listed their house and dealt with the headaches of showings and repairs, negotiations and strict timelines for closings. Sellers went to closing in a moving truck and so did buyers. Everything relied on perfect timing for everything to happen. Lots of drama and massive potential for any one thing to go wrong that sends the entire house of cards tumbling. Delayed lender, appraisal, yada yada yada. 

You take a lot of Xanax in this industry.

Enter Opendoor. A company that pulls the power of the transaction away from the coveted few, and puts it right into the consumers hands. On both the buyer and seller sides. You see, they have the capital to do this. They have the money to purchase the house without the headache of the buyers side and their drama. Seller calls the shots on when closing happens. Seller doesnt have to deal with showings. Seller doesnt have to deal with fixing up their house or repair negotiations. Seller doesnt have to hear about the buyers demands. Seller doesnt have to rely on the buyers lenders drama. Seller doesnt have to deal with Realtors. Seller doesnt have to pay commission. (Oftentimes 6%). Seller is in control. Seller has total power of the transaction. Opendoor makes it easy. 

Money is merely a measurement of stored time and energy. People underestimate how valuable that is.  Opendoor provides value in saving both for the seller. They eliminate the stress and uncertainly of the unknown. 

Opendoor owns the house after closing. They then ready the property to list for sale. They have entire departments devoted to this and marketers on staff who understand exactly what sells a house the quickest. They optimize the house with the knowledge they have. 

Then they list it. Except they dont use one of those mysterious Supra boxes to house the keys to the house that only Realtors have access to. They use their own lockboxes. And they give the power of the showings to the consumer (Buyer) directly. No agent required. The buyer can download their app and access any of their properties, on their schedule. No working around some Realtors schedule. The buyer has the power to steer the ship in their own home buying process. 

When buyer is ready to make an offer, they can fill it out directly on the Opendoor website. The form is so easy to understand that a child could navigate it. The form fills in the contract and meets the specific legal requirements for each state. In the past, this was where Realtors could valuable. The contracts were so hard to understand, the regular consumer couldnt manage them without help. Opendoor makes it possible to.  Kinda like Turbo Tax with taxes. Similar in that regard. 

Additionally, Opendoor offers the buyers discounts for making offers to them directly. 

Opendoor:  If you buy with Opendoor and finance with Opendoor Home loans (ODHL), you can save up to 1% of your home price via a combination of an ODHL lender credit and either a seller credit at closing (If buying directly) or a commission refund (If working with an Opendoor agent). Amounts vary.

And yes, Opendoor has their own in-house mortgage company to finance your home as well. 

Opendoor:  Finance with Opendoor Home Loans and get up to $1,000 credit at closing

Now is the time where I recommend you move over to Opendoor.com and spend 5 minutes browsing their website directly. You will quickly see how easy the interface is to navigate. Yes, even for the retards on this sub. 

In a few years, legislation will catch up and it will start allowing eNotary services on closing documents. Covid is the vehicle for pushing this through. Notes, Deed of Trusts, even deeds will legally be signed electronically. Eventually, even the closing will be able to happen all online. Opendoor says they will handle this part through their app too. 

The real estate iBuying ecommerce market is going to EXPLODE with Millennials and Zoomers and even some Gen X coming into the market.  As a Millenial myself, I dont like or want to deal with other people. We grew up behind the screen and we simple dont know or understand the social skills it takes to communicate face to face. Not only that, we dont want to. Its a waste of time. We want to control everything and we want instant gratification. 

Currently Opendoor is only active in 20 markets in the US. They plan to scale to 100 markets within a year. In the Charlotte market I work in, I have seen the closing attorney who handles the Opendoor closings (NOT my husband) scale from 1 employee to over 100 employees within 2 years. 

Comment from an Opendoor employee on my original post: /u/casrox

I have some insight. Former employee. Basically the way opendoor works is by buying houses for less than market price and creating a floating inventory of product(houses) they they actual place in a holding subsidiary. Some of these houses are in hot markets so flip relatively easily, some are in colder markets so the price will be lower and it will take longer to sell. All these factors + condition of house and title issues come into play when they buy a house or sell a house at a certain price. They use a proprietary algorithm so don't know all the specifics as I wasn't a programmer and never messed with that. They make their money from a combination of closing fees, title work fees and profit off their house flipping. A seller/buyer can also bring their own realtor in, but will end up paying both opendoor fee and realtor fee. A lot of times they are able to make pretty decent profit on hot market houses that cover the losses they might suffer on a property they are having a hard time selling or that ends up being a complete wash due to unforseen circumstances(a house that had a murder happen in it and company was never informed for instance). They have well informed title teams with full curative and escrow staff in house due to their acquisition of title company named osnational. They were doing so much prior to acquisition that osnational created subsidiary companies that's exclusively worked on title and closings for opendoor. Due to this they are able to complete title work extremely fast and in some cases 24-48hr closings were not out of the question. They make money in other ways as well, such as doing outside contract title work for other companies and having a mortgage company built into business(opendoor mortgage) to increase the number of fingers they have in the proverbial pie. I never saw the numbers, as I was just a cog in the machine, but I can tell you the output/transactions increased month over month for many months prior to my leaving. The only real risk they run is of housing market does cool and they are stuck with too much inventory(just like of car market cooled and carving had too many cars and no buyers). With interest rates low tho they also get a steady income stream from refinances so not sure how big of a hit they would take if the cool off only lasted a couple months. I still do same job, just for another company, and will say the whole housing industry(buying/selling transactions) is booming. So much so that at the company I work for now, we are understaffed and 60hr+ weeks are not uncommon in order to keep up with massive volume. Opendoor flips primarily low-mid price range houses - which I assume is because it lowers the risk in case cool off period happens. The place I currently work does real high end boutique place(1.5mil-3mil is average price range) and we are slammed so I can assume pretty easily that opendoor is even more slammed. Finally, opendoor is also increasing to more and more markets. Since I left they have expanded to a handful of markets I know about and I'm sure others that they haven't disclosed publicly yet. Anyway, thanks for coming to my Ted talk.

**wHat AbOuT tHe CrAsH cOmInG! wE aRe In A bUbBlE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

As someone who was in the industry during the recovery during the 2008 crash and who helped people avoid foreclosure firsthand, I can explain to you how what we see happening now is NOTHING like what we saw happen then. 

The catalyst for the 2008 crash was the teaser ARM (Adjustable rate mortgage) rates that people were given for their mortgages. These rates fluctuated as such a volatile rate, that homeowners found themselves in situations where they could not pay their mortgage within a few years of buying. They did not understand the implications of the ARM loans when they signed on at a teaser, discounted interest rate and did not realize how drastically their mortgage payments would change once those rates adjusted. 

The majority of home owners now are at a 2-5% FIXED, 30 year interest rate. Their mortgage payments are about 50% less than what the going rental rate is (at least in my market). People are literally saving thousands of dollars by owning their homes vs. renting. Its cheaper. 

**wHaT AbOuT tHe PaNdEmIc and tHe ImPeNdInG FoReClOsUrEs????**

As someone who works in this industry, I am seeing firsthand that every lender is pushing the unpaid mortgage payments on the backend of the notes. This will allow people to avoid paying large lump sums up front. 

Additionally, NO ONE IS UNDERWATER in their houses right now. So if, for some reason, a lender were to demand payment, the seller could simply sell and walk away. I havent seen a single lender do this. Not one.

**tHiS iS lIKe CARVANA, bUt ReAl EsTaTe iS rIsKiEr.** 

No, owning real estate is no riskier than owning cars. 

**Cars are a depreciating asset.** 

**Real estate is an appreciating asset.** 

95% of millionaires are made with owning real estate, myself included. 

Many people see real estate as a safer store of value than even gold or other goods. Definitely safer than having it sit in the bank. 

Comment: If I knew I was selling my property for less then fair market value, potentially tens of thousands of dollars, Id suck it up and hire an agent.

My Response:

Everyone has their different requirements, desires and wants. Many have different ones. Grandma afraid of Covid and doesn't want showings? No Problemo! No Realtor interview process or dealing with them in the house either? Yes please! Closing happens on my watch at my desired time without crazy buyers in a moving truck barking up my ass? Sign me up! I control the entire transaction myself without relying on a Realtor to do it for me? Sold.

Some people don't care about a few thousand bucks if they know that the time, energy and stress was less. Those things have value too.

People don't realize that Money is merely a storage of value for work/time/energy.

Retail buyers require 10x the headache and energy. You may end up making $2k more on paper, but you've lost it all (and more) by the end of the transaction with the time and energy you had to spend to get there. 

**tHiS iS tHe UbEr Of HoUsEs:**

No, its not. Uber has zero assets. They dont own a single car. 

They have nothing but their systems and software. 

Opendoor actually holds tangible assets unlike companies that literally own nothing like DoorDash, Airbnb, etc. 

Okay, I think Im going to wrap this up. Im sure Ill think of more stuff and will add to it later but I have to get some work done. 

My position: 14 contracts, calls shorts and leaps. 1000 shares.

Title: Some Small US Semiconductor Stocks You May Not Know About
I know you all seem to be mostly into video games, weed, and rainbow colored keyboards, but businesses make many more things than that. One thing they make and is in insanely high demand right now are semiconductors, little things that act as both conductors and insulators and make all your electronics do electronic things.

Trust me, they are very important.

Some of you have no doubt seen $AMD, $NVDA, and $MU on here before. I am sure you have heard of Texas Instruments, since they made the calculators you played Pac-Man and Drug Lord on in high school.

Anyway, for people like me who have many people depending on them for food and shelter and lack the testicular fortitude or smooth brain cells to throw thousands of dollars at one company, here are some more affordable companies based in the US and poised to grow in the coming months/years as demand skyrockets and supply lags behind.

**MaxLinear $MXL**: These guys just keep growing and beating all of their earnings and revenue targets, net revenue up 24% in Q4 of 2020, and have beaten earnings in 6 straight quarters. Their RoE routinely beats the competition, and their projected sales growth is good.

**Chip_MOS $I_MO_S**: (Sorry for the formatting, this guy is just under 1B cap, but did not want to leave it out) Just another small company with good financials and ever increasing sales/revenues, the latter up 24% in January. They have consistently good P/E and P/S ratios, and even offer a pretty generous dividend if you are into that kind of thing.

**Advanced Energy Industries $AEIS**: If you like consistent gainers, this is for you. They basically never fail to meet earnings expectations, and essentially always outperforms competitors in RoE and cash flow.

**ON Semiconductor Corp $ON**: Another consistent gainer that I almost never see in the red regardless of the rest of the market. Revenues that just keep improving, they keep making good acquisitions, some analysts are suggesting 20% or higher gains from these guys in 21-22. Reported earnings per share of 35 cents, just another great surprise form $ON. Options for this company are cheap right now as well, but rising fast. Institutional investors are flocking to this one too, so if you want to follow the smart money, $ON is a good bet.

There are a few more, but I can not mention them due to relatively low market caps. If you do not have much to invest, but want to get in on this sector, check out Magna Chip ($ M X) too.

All these companies have great growth potential and financials, have consistently gained, have excellent analyst scores, and are in a huge growth sector with massive demand and a supply that is so low governments worldwide are seriously looking into how to improve it.

The Biden administration is working on executive orders and funding/tax credits to help these companies pump out more and more product.

Think about some of the big growth industries right now. Well, they all depend on semiconductors. EVERYTHING has a computer in it, and they all need semiconductors, from your car, to your PlayStation, or the lighting/irrigation systems used to grow all that Canadian weed.

These are just my opinions, look into it yourselves before you spend any money. But these are not hyped stocks, so do not expect them to pump or dump, or make you a millionaire overnight. But they sure are green a lot.

Title: Why &lt;$0.05 Penny Options on &lt;1B Market Cap mREIT and Energy Companies Will    (IVR, NAT)
 Hi fellow autists,

NAT (Nordic American Tanker Ltd) is trading at $3.32, market cap $499M. NAT $4.5 Call 02/19/21 is asking for only $0.03! That's only -35.95% OTM.

IVR (Invesco Mortgage Capital) is trading at $3.81, market cap $856M. IVR $4.5 Call 02/19/21 is asking for only $0.04! That's only -18.11% OTM.

The energy sector NAT was trading at $6+ in June 2020. The mREIT sectior IVR has its highs pre COVID at $18+ in March 2020. 

So given the current market sentiment, both mREITs and Energy sector will have tremendous upside with the upcoming stimulus and the the trading sessions will be especially volatile for companies with below $1B market cap and high likelihood of these penny options being ITM!

**TLDR: IVR, NAT penny options calls are for massive** **tendies in two booming sectors (mREIT &amp; Energy).**

Title: Weed!
Crossposting. This keeps getting removed. Think why 

Forget the Shorts %, look at those numbers!!

In the post below, it says 1,43MM Etoro customers hold GME Stock, 11% of Customers:

I myself, have 1500, a lot of people have thousands or hundreds of them, more now with Bid price. But let's take lower average of 5shares/pers = 7MM shares on Etoro.(lower average)

Now, we all know that GME was on top list of RH users, but lets take the same % (lower case scenario) of RH users and same amount of shares:

As they Arte the same users number on RH than Etoro (13MM) = extra 7MM shares on RH (lower average)

Now what about Fidelity users:

32MM users so 11%= 3,52MM x 5shares = 17,6 MM shares on Fidelity (lower average)

DEGiro has 600K users:

600K x 11% x 5 = 330K shares Degiro

What about Trade 212 : 13MM users= 7MM shares on T212



ANd I am not counting the whales and those by brokers in direct

so we have here on those most popular APP = 7 + 7 + 17,6 + 0,33 + 7 = 38,93MM retailers Shares



Yes you read that right !!! 39MM shares detained by retailers without counting the others app or direct brokerage or even the whales, and I took a lower average!!

We know that they the Float share is 48,89MM

OK now you see what I see right? Hold your belt !!!

Last data shows 110% of Institutional Share = 110%/48,89 = 53,779MM institut (lower as I think is higher)

38,93MM + 53,78 MM = 92,7MM Shares detained within Institutions and Retailers while only 48MM are available

==============&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; GME is detained at 193% TOTAL !!!!!



Shorts = 73% so 73% of 92,7MM = 67,6 MM Stocks are shorted

67,6MM but 48,89MM is the real Float = 138% real short Number !!!!



https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gamestop-amc-reddit-investing-213609595.html

In this article it said 4,5% of Americans detained at today GME Stock , let's take just 2% with only 5 GME share= 2% x 5 x 329MM = 32,9MM detained by Americans and let's say just 20% extra for rest of the world.

32,9 + 20% = 39,5MM shares by retailers remember up when I said 38,9 MM ??? Quite close right??



TNDLR

Retailers hold 39MM Shares = 80%

Institutions hold 113 %

Total= 193 % shares are on the market

SO the real Shorts number is 138%





Alright , I am going to serve myself a Gin Tonic ! do you even realize what s that means? it is even worst for HF that we even dreamt about!!!!!! they will have to buy any fucking shorts available twice!!!! So Guys, no matter the price you will put, they will buy it, they HAVE TO !!! even at 100K/share!!!! Be Greedy ::

If you see mistakes please correct me....



Alright even if living abroad not financial adviser just sharing my DD so please share for those paper hands scared and let's enjoy the road.... ;)

Cheers!



From Luxembourg with Love !



ADDED AFTER COMMENTS:

1. yes I forgot the world and Revolut and other APP
2. Read that article

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/implied-volatility-surging-gamestop-gme-135301233.html?guccounter=1

Options @ 800 are skyrocketing just today more than 3M shares. for the newbies, means a HH take an insurance buy paying a premium that if a Stock goes up 800 (in this case) they will "only pay" 800$, the other company pay the extra. Options are with termination dates. You can check here and click on strike to have the higher amount.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME

Meaning they are expecting the stock going way up that 800 so they are taking contract to protect their shorts. (so another premium to add on their shorts premium)

Again they expect to go way up 800..... just think about that.....

Title: Help small business and make $, Invest in regional banks : $KRE 70 April / 80 Leaps
Howdy, you might remember when i came to this community and offered you this idea when KRE was at 36. I'm guessing no because the gay mods deleted my post, here's a screenshot :

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rii170lgc2h61.png?width=793&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8058d9be656fe3340a09da5b2687d3d60ab20e7e

the KRE Rally is not over and here is why :

Regional banks, more so than the big money centers in XLF make their $ by taking loans from the FED or depositors who block their money for a year or two and lend it for longer maturities. The best proxy for this metric is the 10/2 spread and it has been going to the moon !

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img irjkmlqsc2h61...*

Regional banks are the entities that are most exposed to "small business" in the market, in fact if you want to go long the "real economy", KRE is about your only bet along with some office/mall REITS/B2B stocks and the true winner, which hasn't been frontran yet of the upcoming reopening is the real economy. 

Have you heard that papi biden is working on **another stimulus package focused on infrastructure ?** Who loans the money to the small bizes who work on that shit ? you guessed it, KRE. I think most of the market has a hard time understanding the size and potential impact of what the dems are cooking for us, here's an excerpt from top strategist at MS leila : 

 ***Unprecedented stimulus**** The magnitude of monetary + fiscal stimulus in the US is almost hard for the brain to fully appreciate. Were not economists, but it appears as if we are on track for \~9 Trillion between fiscal + monetary in the US, over 3x what we did during the financial crisis. On the fiscal side, if Biden gets his $1.9 Trillion on the back of Trumps $2.2 Trillion + $900 Billion plans, total Fiscal stimulus over the past year will be \~$5 Trillion or \~24% of U.S. GDP. The 2008-2009 fiscal stimulus amounted to \~ $1 Trillion -- so we're doing 5x the fiscal. On the Monetary side, the Fed Balance sheet has risen by $3.6 Trillion since 2019. In 2008-2010 it rose $1.4 Trillion, so we're doing 2.6x the Monetary. These monetary and fiscal efforts in the US equate to over40% of GDP.* 

**But isn't the fed keeping interest rates super low ?** 

**Yes they are but this is the limit,** during the last minutes of the FOMC the topic was du jour was removing the special QE programme. Essentially, given that the **worst is behind us in the real economy, the FED WILL NOT BE MARGINALLY MORE DOVISH AND THE NEXT STEP IS A RATE HIKE CYCLE.** it might start in 22 or 23 but no later. Of course it will be priced in both rates and Bank stocks way ahead of time. in fact you can see that bonds have been selling off lately as the market digests the news around the infrastructure package and the FED speeches always make the bonds bounce but then it gets sold again :).

If you have any more questions surrounding this trade feel free to ask below, i don't feel like writing pages here cuz u are retards and never listen to me.

Title: Complete DD on HYLN. No battery patent, no IP, no product. Nikola 2.0?
Hyliion became a thing in the WSB world once again today.  I'll get to the once again part in a few.

I'm not going even gonna bother with tendies, wifes bf jokes, etc... because as you will see this company is more of a joke than I can make about it.  Also, I was in finance for over a decade, have passed Series 7 &amp; 66 (since lapsed, so fuck you FINRA, I'm not an RR). So I have some clue what I'm talking about.

First, lets talk financials. Courtesy of their [Website](https://investors.hyliion.com/news/news-details/2020/Hyliion-Reports-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results/default.aspx)


Revenue: 0

PE: Divide by zero error


Profit Margin: Zilch

Operating Cash Flow: -11.53 million.


Net loss per share 2019: 0.45, Net Loss per share 2020: 0.76. They are burning more money faster.



**Intangable assets (IP aka patents fall under this) 356 thousand.  And somehow that went down from 2019's number of 429 thousand. If they had dope IP it would be worth more. Also the "new battery" isn't patented or at least mentioned here**


R &amp; D burned 8.13 million in 2020, and Admin burned 3.7 million.



Debt almost quadrupled from 2019 to 2020




Their R&amp;D spending went up 20% and their Admin and salaries almost doubled.

They redeemed warrants at the start of the year diluting shares and raising 142 million.  This isn't generally seen as a good thing.

**In October they joined with another shady looking SPAC called Tortoise that is (was?) based in the Caymans.  Cause the Caymans are never used for shady financial dealings right?**

Their team is lackluster at best. The CEO is inexperienced and has an undergrad in mechanical engineering. And describes himself on the site as a serial entrepreneur, which is super cringe.

The head engineer was an engineer at Dana, which is why they have some relationship with them. Otherwise nothing of note at all. **So anyone saying 'strong team' etc, hasn't even looked at the website.**

**[Other notes: The new battery system isn't patented or proprietary, and is not listed in their patents.  Which are pretty lackluster.](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/hyliion-inc)**


[I\[f you read between the lines, the press release was stating they have a new battery cooling system. That's it.](https://investors.hyliion.com/news/news-details/2021/Hyliion-Introduces-Next-Generation-Battery-Module-to-Improve-Performance-and-Efficiency/default.aspx)

And how it became a thing on reddit once again: Almost a year ago when it launched, it hit $59/share, then dropped to $13 where it stayed.  It's already made bagholders on reddit with BS vaporware.  Don't let it do it again.


TL;DR any way you slice it.  Be it from a fundamentals perspective, IP/ Innovation perspective, or market sentiment perspective, this company is dog shit.  It's a SPAC like Nikola, and it's basically a less impressive dog and pony show without bad photoshops or theatrics.  Like they don't even care that much. There are no rockets in this post for a good fucking reason. If there was an bomb emoji it would be there, but for now I give it this. 


Position: Puts. I was gonna FOMO in, but I read the press release and it looked like shit, and the more I read the more I was sure it was shit. So much so I got puts.  The more I read the more I think its not just shit, but it's a total scam.

Title: GME dd
Okay, so get this. My Granny's left hip is acting up for the second time this winter. That means there is a 100% chance that a video game based brick and mortar business who steals games from children for pennies on the dollar is about to explode. I did some research and I am quite certain this business is $gme. The last time my Granny's hip acted up was, you guessed it, was January 21st right before the first explosion. This means there is only one possible explanation, and that is that GME is going to the moon part 2......or possibly the second very unlikely explanation being completely coincidental, but that can't be the case. But to make sure I did some further research. And it turns out, man has been to the moon, so then it must also be possible to place GameStops on the moon. But I didn't stop there, I needed to be sure. I found this [diamond hand](https://images.app.goo.gl/CAZSpb92PCePKoaX6)
Absolute proof that diamond hands exist. I heard all the talk about hedge funds plotting to overthrow this moon mission, but that's not even a problem because I keep my grass cut low to see the snakes and I don't even own any hedges, and neither should you. So basically feel free to do your own DD but I think you'll see it's pretty obvious at this point.

I'm not a financial advisor, but if you're retarded enough, I'm more than happy to advise you financially.

Title: Shroom stocks - Are they really the next big thing? Specific recommendations inside
The short version: Shroom stocks have huge upside, due to their actual medical effectiveness being very high (loads of studies quoted to back it up) + ongoing approval of many psilocybin-based pharmaceutical drugs in North America + current administration making decriminalization easier. Several mushroom stocks are backed by huge investing figures such as Peter Thiel and Kevin O'Leary. AKA 

3 parts to this DD:

1. The science - why mushrooms have huge potential as medicinal products.
2. The rise of mushrooms and psilocybin as medical drugs
3. Specific stock recommendations and my positions

**My core thesis:** Mushrooms have a lot of scientific evidence backing their beneficial effects for specific conditions. This means that eventually, psilocybin-based drugs are bound to get approved, which will drive the entire mushroom sector up.

**1 - THE SCIENCE - WHY THEY HAVE HUGE POTENTIAL AS MEDICINAL PRODUCTS**

The evidence behind the effectiveness of mushrooms for various health conditions is piling up.

Harvard University: "the study authors and the commentators  who include Charles Schuster, former director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse; Nobel Prize winner Solomon Snyder; and nationally known addiction expert Herbert Kleber  recommend revived investigation of the therapeutic and scientific uses of hallucinogens" - [https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter\_article/Reviving\_the\_study\_of\_hallucinogens](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/Reviving_the_study_of_hallucinogens)

Pharmacognosy Review: "They are also one of the richest source of anticancer and immunomodulating agents. Thus these novel myochemicals from these mushrooms are the wave of future." - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3249912/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3249912/)

3 Biotech Journal: "This will further help the researchers to understand the metabolites and find other metabolites as well from the mushrooms which can be used for the potential development of the drugs to treat various life-threatening diseases." - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6056353/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6056353/)

DEPRESSION: psilocybin therapy for a startup was given breakthrough therapy designation (a review fast track) by the FDA for the treatment of depression (more on this later).

Psilocybin therapy can help smokers abstain from smoking, according to a small pilot study: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5641975/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5641975/)

Another open label study found that it can reduce heavy drinking: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25586396](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25586396)

A randomized, double-blind trial from Johns Hopkins in 2016 found that one single dose of psilocybin drastically improved quality of life and decreased depression and anxiety in people suffering from life-threatening cancer diagnoses: [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881116675513](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881116675513)

SUMMARY: There is a huge amount of scientific evidence showing the potential of psilocybin against depression, heavy smoking and drinking, to improve quality of life in cancer patients, and as an anti-cancer agent. This medical evidence is not well known and relatively hard to find and analyze, making it an opportunity for the entire psilocybin sector.

**2 - THE RISE OF PSILOCYBIN DRUGS + SLOW DECRIMINALIZATION**

Psilocybin is slowly decriminalized in the US - Denver, Oakland, and Santa Cruz have legalized its use not long ago. Lawmakers in Ann Arbor, Michigan voted to decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms and it's been legalized for therapeutic use in the entire state of Oregon.

I'm NOT claiming that full decriminalization is coming anytime soon. However, the Biden administration SHOULD in theory make at least partial decriminalization a real possibility.

However, my main argument is that it doesn't have to be legal on a major scale at all to explode. The real, major trend is the use and approval of psilocybin in pharmaceuticals.

Whenever a new field get such high amount of scientific studies proving its potential (see above), it's inevitable that startups and firms will try to create patented drugs to benefit from it.

And governments are starting to realize that targeted use of psilocybin for specific health conditions can be very beneficial. Which means that this opportunity is becoming more and more real and interesting for biotech companies.

According to [thekit.ca](https://thekit.ca) \- In Canada, "The process is well on its way. In August 2020, federal health minister Patty Hajdu granted four end-of-life patients exemptions from current drug laws to use psilocybin to help deal with the anxieties of their terminal illness. (Fifty-three-year-old Laurie Brooks, who has colon cancer, was one of themread her story next in our Psychedelics Now series). Three more exemptions quickly followed, perhaps a harbinger of restrictions being eased."

In other words, various psilocybin-based drugs are being approved as we speak, all over North America. As we've seen with marijuana, Canada is usually a trend-setter - and approval of psilocybin pharmaceuticals in Canada is likely to lead to the same outcome in the USA.

As a matter of fact, it's already happening in the US. Like I said earlier, the startup Compass Pathways's new psilocybin treatment received "breakthrough therapy" status - essentially giving it a fast track to FDA approval.

This would have NEVER been possible under the previous administration, and is a sign of things to come.

SUMMARY: The current administration makes decriminalization of mushrooms more likely. However, even if full decriminalization is light years away, the FDA approval of psilocybin-based drugs and the same phenomenon in Canada is driving the entire sector way up. Again, this is due to the fact that mushrooms ACTUALLY WORK for a wide range of health conditions.

**3 - SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS AND MY POSITIONS**

Now, with all this in mind - if the entire mushroom sector is bound to explode, which stocks do I recommend?

1. Compass Pathways ($CMPS) - No need for a huge explanation here. CMPS is the company whose drug received breakthrough therapy designation. This makes FDA approval significantly more likely. Probably the leading mushroom stock. Oh - and the stock is backed by Peter Thiel, too.
2. Mind Medicine ($MMEDF) - Kevin O'Leary invested in the pre-IPO round of $24 million. They're currently running clinical trials to measure the effectiveness of LSD for anxiety and headaches. The company focuses on psychedelic-oriented therapies for anxiety, addiction and ADHD - which are probably the most promising areas of research at the moment.
3. Champignon Brands ($SCHRMF) - Also using psychedelic medicine against depression, PTSD and other mental health conditions. They're already offering ketamine treatment for adults with depression in a rapid treatment center in Ottawa.

There are obviously other stocks, but I've vetted these 3 stocks for management integrity (extremely important in a sector like psychedelics) and long-term commercial viability.

My positions:

\- 1000 shares of $CMPS

\- 2000 shares of $MMEDF

\- 4000 shares of $SHRMF

Track record:

My last recommendation of $BG in WSB is now extremely profitable (called it at $70, now trading at $76).

Usual disclaimers: There's no guarantee of anything ever, and most morons who invest end up losing money. Sorry pal.

Title: AMC - THE FIGHT IS NOT OVER!
A quick update on new information for all my fellow bag holder apes.

What's the case with AMC? Is the run over? Has the squeeze squozed?

No.

AMC's price jump back on the 27th of Jan was due to a high demand in the stock following the GME squeeze. People who did not want to miss out on an another opportunity wanted to jump on the next trend that was hot on WSB.

This, also explains the sudden drop in price of AMC. A lot of new members of WSB and novice traders who were looking to make a quick buck out of the momentum. Those who saw GME explode in a matter of days perceived that the same may happen to AMC. That, accompanied by numerous false expectations built up by Stocktwats and some WSB members, caused for all of those who had entered at the peak of AMC to suffer cognitive dissonance - i.e. FUD.

The number one rule of marketing is "never create high expectations that you cannot meet". Why? Because, while it may drive a lot of new clients in the short term, it will damage your brand and your company's success in the long-term. The same rule applies to practically everything else. In AMC's case, high expectation was created, dates were given, and when those expectations were left unmet - novice traders got spooked and closed their positions and sold their shares.

Accompanied by constant media bombardment of fear mongering news left and right, data manipulation, etc. I personally believe that this is what drove the price down. Some form of market manipulation could have had a play here, but I'd rather base my DD on more tangible reports rather than speculations.

Hedge funds are notorious for using media coverage and PR to influence the price of a security.

With all of that being said, why do I believe that AMC has an incredible potential to explode?

Utilization rate was 91.4% on the 8th of February:

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img vfzin8lg31h61...*

And has since dropped to 88.4%, which is still quite high.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/98vvwidh31h61.png?width=353&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743a2c23504fc1414b8a7e234d32274a4083a1d6

What this shows us is that about 89% of the stocks available to be borrowed have been borrowed. However as you can see the total number of shares on loan has increased - from 81.7m to 82.3m.

This just shows that the drop in utilization rate has dropped as more shares have been qualified as suitable to borrow - recently bought shares.

What else do we know?

We now know, thanks to Fidelity, that retail ownership of the stock is 87.5%!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0ew7hb2i31h61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16392e7dc6020f44715041681e16bb374d8d8dff

**Why's this exciting? Well, if we look at the exciting case of VolksWagen (VW):**

The short interest of the stock was about 13%. The main reason why it exploded was because there were no stocks available for short sellers to buy back was and cover their positions was very low as Porsche had increased its stake in VW to over 74%. Short sellers were forced to buy the stock back at what the supply (holders) were willing to give for it. Simply because they can do that.

So hedges have two options, accept defeat and buy back to close their positions and hedge their risk by buying some of those stock. Or, keep paying a hefty premium based on the floating APR, which changes literally everyday based on the volume.

Institutional investors are increasing their portfolio holding of AMC:

Vanguard - 55.46% increase worth, I dunno but they have bought 2.7M new shares.

Blackrock - 69% increase worth $13.17M

Northern Trust Corp - 41% increase worth $2.12M

And many more who bought into the stock recently:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cwuglgpj31h61.png?width=1209&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74a91d31604f67497b7ced308e400eda66035f3a

We're also seeing a lot of people reporting that when they attempt to short the stock they are receiving error messages telling them **"This stock is hard to borrow".**

**Such as Etrade:**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xj13u0ck31h61.jpg?width=566&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e443aa0ce20eb70bf67584db89ba4950b54f5ee

**And the lightspeed platform:**

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img hxn7536l31h61...*

Which also reported that the available shares to short are 460k with a borrow fee of 4.5%.

shows us that the short volume of AMC was 40% yesterday.

&amp;#x200B;

Naked short report collect their data from FINRA. But it's interesting to see that Fintel is reporting a 21% short volume. I've genuinely lost all hope in them by now.

**CONCLUSION**

What this leaves me to believe is that AMC is turning into a bubble for hedgies that is ready to burst any moment now.

Don't lose hope and hold your positions if you can. If you can't that's fine. Look after yourself first.

This is an extremely important lesson for newbie traders and investors for the number one rule of - Do not let your emotions control your investment decisions. This is probably the best stock to train that element.

Invest what you are willing to lose - especially when dealing with highly speculative and volatile stocks such as GME and AMC.

**For all of us who are still holding - stay strong. This might prove to be beneficial.** However, this is no guarantee, obviously.

Take everything I've said with a grain of salt and do your own research. I just wanted to share with you my personal speculation.

**Let me know what you think!**

Title: Attention retards, the future is in psychedelic research companies
Im in the field neuroscience and pharmaceutical industry. Listen up guys So youre probably wondering hmmm why should I keep and eye out in these stocks. Well the answer is big pharma is going to buy them out after they compete with their current products and win. The entire sector of anti psychotics anti depressants ssris mood suppressors maois anti anxiety medication addiction medication and Adhd medication are going to be taken out by these companies and then bought into the big pharma borg. The evidence is in the scientific studies which show that these psychadelic and other illicit compound research companies have the most effective cutting edge mental illness treatment on the planet. Ketamine for example is the worlds most effective short term anti depressant. Magic mushrooms are shown to be the worlds most effective treatment at treating treatment resistant depression. Ibogaine is the worlds most effective anti addiction drug for heroin, with 77% of users in one study not relapsing when they didnt return to their old enviornment. Lsd is shown to be incredibly promising to treat alcohol addiction. Alcoholics Anonymous started out using it actually. Mdma is considered the worlds most promising drug for treated PTSD AND CPTSD. DMT is being used in new trials to treat depression as well with much success. The thing all these stocks have in common is that companies such as mindmed compass pathways Numinus wellness and others are all researching and gaining patents on these drugs and developing new analogues to patent and sell for insane profits. The future of healthcare is in these drugs. Oh and the growth in this sectors huge. The sector is on track to hit 6.8 billion dollars marketshare in 2027. This is the next boom.

Title: A good value w/ div all while screwing the massive shorts! $RYCEY
You might need to be patient but I feel this is one of the safer plays mentioned here. It's currently just riding above the $1.30 support. Yes they had a hard year  last year as well as about every other aviation related company. The vaccine is slowly being deployed and airline traffic is already up substantially since mid-year.

Not too long ago Rolls Royce announced that it acquired the company Servowatch Systems with the aim of entering the ship automation industry. It is a significant development and one that will pay dividends long term. They also have recently partnered with Infosys a global leader in next-generation digital services and consulting. This will be used in their upcoming movement towards ship automation. This adds to the deals with the UK space energy and Virgin Galactic. Big success is around the corner.

Further, the company continues to expect to turn cash flow positive at some point during second quarter fiscal 2021, target at least 750 million free cash flow as early as 2022 and at least 2 billion pounds from disposal proceeds. In the 11-month period to ending November, large engine LTSA invoiced flying hours or EFH were approximately 42% of their prior year level. In October and November combined, EFH increased to approximately 33% compared to 2019. In the third quarter, EFH were 29% of the prior year, an improvement versus the 24% seen in Q2.

Not even mentioning 16,000 military engines with 160 customers in 103 different countries (war is always inevitable). Mix that with the fact that Brexit is official and you have a company that is desperately needed and will surely be the benefactor of a sweetheart deal by the government.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm adding this because a post I saw earlier that I agree with very much, the shorts are absolutely trashing RYCEY and this company deserves to get back to normal. Their debt issues could be helped if we help them by screwing the shorts. The short $ is insane and they need to learn another lesson.

The ceiling is so much higher than the floor in this situation. Here is just added info for those who want it.

Ticker - Rycey

Mkt cap - 12.2 billion

Volume typically 5-9mil

Title: SKM undervalued. I like the stock

This isn't financial advise, I'm not an advisor of any kind. I just like this stock and rocket emojis too. 

TLDR: SKM is undervalued. It's wireless business should worth 10B(or more) and it's 20% stake in sk Hynix is valued at 15.4B. 
Shares should be 40$ to reflect that.
Spin-out catalyst could bring that value to shareholders.


 SKM has a 20% stake in SK Hynix which equates to nearly 2/3 of its market cap.
Which means it's wireless business is SUPER undervalued, or you can get super discounted exposure to SK Hynix. Either is bullish.

Rumors of spinning out the non-wireless businesses from SKM would bring that value to shareholders.

Insiders are buying more, not unloading. Which means insiders at SKM also like rocket emojis


 Risk and catalyst:
Spin offs could be unwelcome or difficult to achieve, keep the value discounted.
Catalyst: south Korea updated its fair trade act making spins offs easier to achieve.

Had to check a few times because I couldn't believe it. 
The 20% ownership of SK Hynix is supposedly valued at roughly 15.4ish Billion usd.
The entire market cap for SKM listed shows 15.75B usd. 

It seems pretty crazy to discount the wireless business they run to only 0.35B. it's probably worth at least 10B? 13B? Let's say 10 for discount sake. For the sake of being lazy, and you probably stopped reading already anyways, let's completely discount all their other retail businesses to 0 and ignore the deal with Microsoft they made for Xbox sales and streaming.

10B + 15.4 = 25.4B I think that will be reasonable for a market cap.

Skm share price would be somewhere near $40 if the wireless business and the 20% ownership of SK Hynix were not discounted.


Downside risk... Lost opportunity somewhere else. It's already discounted and the risk I see is the spin out not happening. 

Sideways price action would be the risk (unless you're thetagang)

I like this stock because it's undervalued. 


Title: I Think I Found A Way To Predict Dips with NASDAQ PSX and FINRA Volume, Or Maybe I Really Am Autistic
   Last night I looked into SNDL and started comparing activities across the various markets that I could find, two for NASDAQ and FINRA's off-exchanges volumes. I sort of expected the relative volumes to be comparable in ratio, but they're not.

   No, in fact there is some SERIOUS delay in tracking when markets start to swell up in short volume. If you look at Figure 1 you can see that they don't really seem to follow each other at all most of the time.

Except, when the different market volumes DO start to overlap and follow each other, THAT is when we see the larger dips in stock prices for those days!

&amp;#x200B;

Now if you look at Jan 27th and Feb 10th in Figure 1 you'll see that NASDAQ PSX short volume peaked high, and FINRA and NASDAQ Boston synced up and peaked the very next day.

[Figure 1: Jan28th and Feb 11th were the largest dips, and also when NASDAQ B and FINRA short volumes started to sync up! ](https://preview.redd.it/2dj8tyjpqzg61.png?width=569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99aba3f5759d0272c401877acdef93cfea37e73d)

   Yes, it is really easy with hindsight 20/20 to say "OH YEA IT WAS IN THE DATA RIGHT THERE" but I noticed something from another "penny stock" and made the same plot for the different volumes in the market. 

*Processing img f5a16zi7tzg61...*

   Here, we again see the THREE DIFFERENT MARKETS dont usually line up, but when THEY DO START TO SYNC, the price has the largest dips the next day!

   So if this is correct, than it's possible to see dip the next day **IF the NASDAQ PSX ShortVolume and FINRA Short Volume begin to move together** towards a peak. We'll see tomorrow, but I think this will show a drop tomorrow of over 20%

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:**

* Using only 2 data points(stocks) I was able to draw a trendline!
* If different markets start to sync up in volumes, the next day seems to have the largest dips in share price.
* IF my shit analysis is correct, than Boaty Stock is going to crash by over 30% tomorrow.

Title: $DASH, a journey back to $100 
This stock makes no sense whatsoever. While I believe that the growth of the company has been impressive, its ridiculous that a company with 879M last quarter in revenue and negative earnings is trading at 67.74B. With 2020 revenue estimates sitting around 2.86B that's 23.69x (nice) REVENUE. To put this number intro perspective, we can take a look at two main comps in $GRUB and $UBER. 

Currently, $GRUB is trading at around 3.62x revenue w/ 1.82B in rev and a market cap of 6.589.

Valuing $UBER's rideshare business based off $LYFT multiples (\~85.5B), values their Uber Eats segment at around 26.89B which has done 1.356B in revenue last quarter (more than DoorDash in case you didn't notice). 

These multiples in comparison to DoorDash's should be enough to convince you that DoorDash is overvalued as fuck but just to make my point in clearer we can take a look at one of DoorDash's own graphics from their S-1

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img muzg1f9ghzg61...*

As you can see, DoorDash is boasting about their ability to grow their market share in terms of total sales processed but their earnings clearly show that their ability to convert sales to revenue is not as strong as competitors. All this proves is that DoorDash will have difficulty in the future expanding their market share (50% is generally a pretty strong level of resistance, especially within products that are relatively elastic), slowing further revenue growth. Even taking into account their ventures into ghost kitchens and attempts to create their own food/grocery delivery ecosystem, their current valuation cannot be justified. A best case scenario w/ continued growth and maybe even profit does not justify doordash's current evaluation. 

tldr: a company making less money compared to comps, that will also have a harder time growing compared to comps, is trading at multiples 5-10x more.

personally I would recommend puts a couple months out alongside picking up uber or grub equity as a hedge (this is not investment advice though).

Title: Psychedelics here we come
Aside from GME and AMC flooding the front page of this subreddit, you occasionally see some solid DD on psychedelics. WSB needs to get their shit together on this one. Chasing weedstocks right now is like paying for your plane ticket at the gate. If you missed out, tough noodles. If you haven't heard of something it's probably because it isn't popular yet. This is where psychedelic stocks come in. 

More and more states are starting to legalize marijuana. This leads to more liberal policies with other drugs. Example: Colorado. They just legalized shrooms. Oregon let's you consume whatever drugs you want now. No other state is going to do that without legalizing weed first. This trend will likely follow as other states become more liberal on drugs. Keep in mind that the current party in power is probably more likely to allow this type of research than the previous one.

 It's currently priced at $0.69 cents. This price is extremely sexy and I'll be going in simply off the price. If you care about doing research you're in the wrong sub. Remember sir, this is a casino.

Title: Why Yandex (YNDX) is poised for optimal growth and massive expansion
Why Yandex is poised for optimal long term growth and massive expansion

I'm going to cut to the chase because I know most of you are on the verge of bankruptcy at age 19 because you got in at $450 on GME and wondering why its not going to $1000 after you paper handed at $439 and sold.

&amp;#x200B;

# What is Yandex?

Yandex is a multinational corporation that operates primarily in Russia, Europe and ex-Soviet bloc offering a wide range of services. Primarily their revenues are from being a search engine, taxi services and other segments. Currently they offer more than 70 services (Streaming subscriptions like Netflix, Yandex.Music like Spotify, Classifieds ads, self-managed subscriptions for ad campaigns, self driving cars, deliveries, marketplace and a fuck ton more)

&amp;#x200B;

# But first, fundamentals.

This is to help you sleep better at night so you can worry more about your 35c 2/19 AMC calls you blew your money into.

As you can see Yandex has been seeing consistent revenue growth since 2017. Recently, its delivery service has begun turning a profit and is widely used among the citizens of Russia.

Read that again. **A Taxi/food delivery service is turning a profit.** That is a big accomplishment.

Check the 2018 &amp; 2019 numbers. Now, do you want to know something else? **They currently have enough cash (1.1b$) to cover all their current total liabilities or all their convertible (one or the other) at any time they need.**

In addition, they've repeated in their financial statements that the liquid cash they have **is enough to cover operating costs should the pandemic continue.**

This tells me they're not gonna lay down like a bitch and cry to daddy when a white swan curve ball is thrown at them (I'm looking at you airlines)

This is their free cash flow from previous 3 years and TTM. You always want to see a positive cash flow to ensure that companies have enough liquidity to stay afloat and keep them from issuing new shares to raise capital. Spikes in cash flow from growth companies is not uncommon, it is mainly due to usual acquisitions, restructuring, re-investments made. Current outstanding shares: \~345m

&amp;#x200B;

# Now, on to some of their services.

This is just a brief overview as their business model is pretty extensive and by this time you lovely bastards have already bought OTM calls expiring this weekend. (Don't yo, this is a long term play)

**Yandex.Lavka**

1. Grocery delivery within 5-12 min is the goal. Some sites are achieving this already
2. Takt time per grocery item bagged is 10s. Takt time is the amount of time it takes to complete one process.
3. Groceries are then transferred to drivers for delivery (think Amazon Prime Now)
4. In order to reduce costs, additional lavkas in high concentration areas will be built.
5. Not all but some Lavkas are kitchens where actual food is cooked
6. Yandex Rover is making deliveries (actively) in three different locations. Currently a test but with the goal of going 100% driverless for deliveries and reduce costs.

&amp;#x200B;

**Yandex.Market**

1. Their current primary growth segment. They've recently acquired Sberbank's stake (Russia's most influential and one of largest banks) and now own 100% of market. Their goal is to rival other marketplace and ecommerce companies such as [Ozon.ru](https://Ozon.ru)
2. They currently have fulfillment centers and are in the process of building additional ones. Does not want to store its own Yandex branded products but wants to become a pure marketplace that offers fulfillment services for sellers and makes it easier for customer (cliche, but think Amazon)

&amp;#x200B;

**Yandex.Go**

1. Offers delivery services to residential and commercial customers (stuff ranging from documents to pianos)
2. More than 100k deliveries made per day on other customers orders
3. "Delivery with a click" which delivers the orders to nearby lavkas (think Amazon locker). Delivery goals are to be within 15 min.

&amp;#x200B;

**Yandex.Cloud**

Not much to say here but theyre offering cloud services to companies. Main competition Amazon AWS

**Yandex.Maps**

Same as above. Main competitor Google Maps

**Yandex.Search**

Their actual search engine that makes up bulk of their revenues.

1. What I loved seeing in their recent financial statements is that **while search engine revenues kept increasing, their TAC (traffic acquisition costs, the cost Yandex pays for others to refer customers to them) is decreasing.** What does this mean? It means customers are going directly to Yandex instead of using a medium. **Think**, why the fuck unless you're a boomer would you go to google, search for 'amazon' when you can go to amazon directly? This is actually a legit problem Google faces as Amazon cuts down on their revenues by not allowing customers to see Google Ads.
2. TAC decreased nine months ended Sep 19 to Sep 20 by 16% while total ad revenues grew by 1%. Read that again god damn it. **They're paying 16% less while maintaining their ad revenues, their biggest segment!**

**Yandex Self Driving Group**

Yo. This shit. Is. Legit.

Let me tell you about the streets of fucking Moscow. Dirt, snow, murky (or none at all) traffic lanes, chaotic drivers, alleys tighter than your uncles anus when JNJ took another -1.5% hit on his portfolio. And they STILL managed to develop an autonomous driving vehicle that navigates through all that shit without user input.

They currently have logged over 5.5 million miles using autonomous driving in Tel Aviv, Michigan and Moscow. That is a big fucking deal. They also have a partnership with Hyundai.

**However**, coming straight from their engineers it will take several years before fully autonomous driving can EXCEED human driving. This means it will take several years for perfection, whos to say sales cant happen before that?

# Other stuff

They sponsor educational camps and programs that focus on hard sciences in Russia (Physics, mathematics, engineering) and they continue to choose talent from these areas. This lessens the reliance on foreign specialists from the US/Europe to develop their products

They focus heavily on customer service and truly understand their core audience. I am telling you, Russians (especially those born in Soviet era) is TOUGH to accept technology. And yet they've done it by Yandex.taxi and Yandex.Lavka .

I'm kinda of a gay bear for our stock market right now, I feel like we're running on fumes with the stimulus cash and might see some extreme volatility in short term in US stocks.

Institutions have loaded up on Yandex since late 2020. Don't ever take this as a tell-tale sign to buy, but rather as one part to consider

# Gay Bear cases (in this case I am also a gay bear)

Russia is not stable politically - things can be done under the table.

* True, fair risk. But more or less the same thing in US except it's official (lobbying, insider trading, congress hearings that are just a facade)

They're too over-extended in their segments. They're focusing on all at once instead of focusing on what they can do really well.

* I would be concerned about this if their cash flow, revenues and net incomes would be decreasing YoY. However their current trajectory is that theyre consistently increasing. Also, think about it more simply - if they have these specialists working on all these segments, they can easily sell them off for a profit. Yandex.Pay was a cashless payment system that was 100% sold off to Sberbank. It is something that Yandex created and then re-invested those proceedings to their different ventures like Yandex.Market

Title: To all my Peak Freak Apes - there is one major reason to not let out of your SNDL position just yet
So the market corrected today. There has been a ton of press in the last 72 hours about how Sundial is an inflated stock and that no doubt had an effect on the market today. That, and, if we are being frank. The stock was probably a bit overvalued given the lack of DD that actually caused it rise.  


But let's pause right there and take a minute to discuss value. Value, some may argue, is only held intrinsically. However, the reality is that value is always set by the buyer. The market is driven by market psychology. The point here is that no matter what reason SNDL gained over the last two weeks, the value was there. For those of us who bought and and have gains, and those of us who bought and are holding the bag right now -- the fact of the matter is for a period of time the value of this stock had increased. We ourselves saw the higher value in it, otherwise we wouldn't have bought it at the price we did, now would we have? Whether a rise in value is due to the company experiencing a catalyzing event, or because a bunch of retarded apes like flinging their own shit around, it doesn't really matter - the value went up.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I only paused for that brief aside because I want to tell my fellow apes - stop being peak freaks. A day of correction isn't the end of the world. The fact of the matter is, this stock may have been overvalued at $4, but at under a dollar it was drastically undervalued given the "money moves" they have been making in the last 10 months.  


Now, segue into the point of all this. Due to the rise in value over the last 9 days of SNDL, regardless of what caused that rise, SNDL has made it into the territory of becoming compliant. 9 consecutive days of over $1 and tomorrow is day 10. What does this mean? It means the stock, having been in jeopardy of being delisted from Nasdaq ever since it transferred to the exchange, lost investor interest. Now, with a 10 day consecutive period trading over $1, the stock will be no longer be in jeopardy of being delisted (at least for 90 more days). The Big takeaway here is this: SINCE $SNDL WAS LISTED ON NASDAQ, IT HAS \*NEVER\* REACHED THIS COMPLIANCE THRESHOLD. Since day 1 it has literally been fighting to stay on NASDAQ. Now, in all likelihood, it is going to get to stay. This will likely serve as a catalyst event to boost the stock short term.  


I am not saying this stock is destined to go back to $4, but if you are down today and want to let your shares grow and then go for the profit take, the opportunity has not disappeared.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR $SNDL gets NASDAQ compliance tomorrow and then we should anticipate a bump of some sort in the price due to the new-founded exposure.

Trade    SCI ER on 2/15; 3/19 Options Calls; Long Equity    
Ticker    $52.34    
Thesis

Funeral Home &amp; funeral home near me are trending &amp; $SCI is the largest provider of funeral, cremation, and cemetery services.

Based on the Q4 Covid deaths and also an aging Boomer population, $SCI is well positioned for consistent growth for years to come. They are also poised for an excellent earnings report on Monday, 2/15 Load up soon or youll be left in the dust.

The search trends for funeral home are at all time highs on the 5 year chart. I will also provide a few snapshots from the earnings transcript where the SCI team is discussing the increased interest in Preneed cemetery plots. If youre unfamiliar with this, its basically buying a cemetery plot before you need one. Theyre typically financed over a 5 year term, but the revenue is instantly recognized.

The SCI team also pointed out on their last earnings call that their earnings were strong due to the unfortunate amounts of COVID deaths. This was during Q3 earnings, and youll see in the chart below that there were massive increases in deaths during Q4 compared to Q3. The pandemic has instilled fear in many, and as deaths increase, the fear increases. This will likely result in increases in at need services and preneed bookings.

Many companies benefited from COVID from a financial perspective. $SCI is one that has seen a major boost in revenues from the pandemic, however they will not experience the some drop off. Death is an unfortunate thing, but will happen to us all. The aging Boomer population will continue to result in increased revenues for $SCI

CDC Deaths 2020 Vs 2019 https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/provisional-tables.htm

The CDC is a bit behind on reporting of deaths, however most interesting correlation I found is that April had a major uptick in % differential for deaths. This major uptick, and sustained differential from April to September can arguably be attributed to the pandemic. Both due to COVID deaths, and indirect deaths as a result of the pandemic.

**Preamble:** What is Draganfly? For more than 20 years, Draganfly has been in the drone industry, supporting clients with enterprise drone solutions, contract engineering services, custom software, professional UAV services, and more. These are some of the drones that they manufacture and sell (more can be found on their website):

[Draganfly Drones](https://preview.redd.it/6p41nds75yg61.png?width=688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9271746fd10a90ca72e2c9eb1b7980d77abccc9d)

They have had a working prototype more than 12 years ago which can be found on their Utube channel. And they also have presence in Agriculture, Energy, Military and Government, Public Safety and Insurance. Draganfly Inc. is a legit company.

**Recent strides:**

* [Partnership with an AI mining firm in land mine detection](https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=17953503&amp;gfv=1)
* [COVID Vaccine Delivery](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/nypost.com/2021/02/09/covid-19-vaccine-drone-delivery-being-developed/amp/)
* [Selected to provide engineering and development services for Drone-based Air Support](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/21/2162256/0/en/Draganfly-Selected-to-Provide-Engineering-and-Development-Services-for-Drone-Based-Air-Support-Defense-System.html)
* [Partnerships with US Department of Agriculture](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/31/2152113/0/en/US-Department-of-Agriculture-Selects-Draganfly-Commander-Drone.html)

All of these accomplishments have been made in &lt;3months and they're continuing to invest more in marketing and PR with the CEO becoming very active on social medias (Utube and Twitter) as well as doing interviews on news stations like Bloomberg to really put their name out there. Bluntly put, the company was as asleep the past 2 decades, but now, as the drone industry has drawn so much attention through R&amp;D and emphases in contactless and unmanned transportation services catalyzed by COVID, the company's current investments in R&amp;D, product ingenuity and revenues are on a tangential incline.

In the past year, the company's share price was indeed stale as they were merely listed in the shitty Canadian markets under the ticker [DFLY.CN](https://dfly.cn/). But as soon as they entered PINX (able to be traded by American investors), their share price saw a massive surge. Not only that, they're now trying to [become listed on the NASDAQ](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/13/2158016/0/en/Draganfly-Begins-Process-to-List-on-NASDAQ.html) (expect &lt;3months for them convert stock exchanges).

**Competitor Analysis:**

There are always the big names in the drone industry and many players are entering this market as there seems to be a rising demand. Boeing ($BA), AeroVironment ($AVAV), Lockheed Martin ($LMT), Ambarella ($AMBA), Parrot ($PARRO) to name a few.

But of course, Draganfly cannot be compared with these giants... yet. Currently, I would put Draganfly beside Alpine4Technologies ($ALPP). A pennystock that's seen massive inclines as they're making similar strides like Draganfly such as acquiring companies, establishing strategic partnerships, getting listed on the NASDAQ, etc.

Both of these stocks have escaped the pennystock *zone* rather quickly.

**Financial Analysis:**

Well... their financials aren't very good... Probably the only caveat in investing in this company. As a value investor, you'd say they're extremely over-valued. But what era are we living in? We easily create massive bubbles for growth stocks and we only invest in speculative/growth stocks quickly inflating their share price to x100 revenue multiples. But one thing is for sure, they've seen a massive surge in revenue that caught everyone's attention in its recent quarters:

***Fiscal 2020 Third Quarter Highlights***

*Revenue in the third quarter grew by 222% to a record of $1,453,000, compared to revenue of $451,000 in the same period in 2019;*

*Revenue increased $527,365 or 56% as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020; and*

*Gross Profit increased by 47.5% in the third quarter as compared to the same period in 2019 and increased 29% from the previous quarter ended June 30, 2020.*

**Catalysts:**

* They successfully become listed on the NASDAQ. This will be tremendous as it would garner more investors to look into this stock.
* Building up from my previous point, the most bullish catalyst that will rocket this to the moon: **$ARKX!**  

   * $ARKX - the Space Exploration ETF that'll become tradeable on March 29 which will have 45-55 holdings sending this stock to the moon as the date approaches.
   * $ARKX - publicly announced that not only will $ARKX have holdings in space exploration aircrafts, they'll be [investing in drone companies](https://evtol.com/news/ark-invest-announces-space-exploration-fund-including-drones-electric-aircraft/)! Hence why, becoming listed on the NASDAQ is imperative for Draganfly to soar. Even if they are not picked up by $ARKX, Draganfly will still do well as $ARKX makes headway for the drone industry as a whole.
* Continued marketing and partnerships. They might become partnered with a big name as the drone industry is rather small at the moment.

**Price target:**

At least $12 &lt;3 months

Title: #SaveTheMalls for a Good Long-Term (Yes, the Dreaded Word on WSB) Investment Opportunity
So, I want you all to listen up and listen up good. We've become pimps for equities: prop 'em up to make them look pretty and sell them off to a troglodyte infested with STD's. We need to change the way we see stocks as a piece of a company that offers potentially good returns with a little bit of patience and gambling. Get-rich-quick schemes, as we have seen throughout the last 30 days can easily turn into get-broke-even-faster gambles that ruins your wallet and stock market participation when faith is lost in the system (which is key if we want to grow retail investing to the likes off our boomer counter). 

You might've heard "you want to invest in your future." Take it seriously. Throwing 10-50 stacks at GameStop to fend off "short ladder attacks" or injecting steroids into a no-name Canadian weed company that rivals the market cap of Wendy's is pretty reckless, and you deserve to lose that money when it craters. INVEST LONG TERM BUT GAMBLE WITH THE MARKET. Make sounds decisions but make bets on market conditions to fulfill your cocaine addiction.

With that said, there's a great investment opportunity in SPG (Simon Property Group). Simon is an American commercial real estate company, one of the largest REITs, and the largest shopping mall operators in the US. They had a steep selloff in March of last year, but has seen a rise of 3100 basis point YTD (31%). They have more room to climb because of stock momentum, COVID vaccines, consumer demand, and a aggressive strategy to stay ahead of competition. Despite this, they're still bullish. During the Q4 call, they remain "confident" that the worse is behind them, and SPG is trading at a discount of $109 to its target price consensus of $125.

In 2020 with COVID ravaging the bottom line for a lot of companies, they pulled in some impressive numbers. 

**Company Statistic Over the Last Year back from December 2020**  
 

* generated over $2.3 billion in operating cash flow;
* acquired an 80% interest in The Taubman Realty Group who specialize in super-regional and outlet shopping malls in the United States and China (China is back in business, remember?) ;
* raised over $13 billion in the debt and equity markets
* opened two new international shopping destinations, expanded two others and completed three domestic redevelopments;
* returned more than $2 billion to shareholders in cash dividends paid (for comparison, even though they're not a REIT, Ford suspended dividends along with many other companies)
* Occupancy was 91.3% at December 31, 2020. (Doesn't even seem like COVID made a dent).
* Base minimum rent per square foot was $55.80 at December 31, 2020, an increase of 2.2% year-over-year.

**Chart Analysis**

They have historically been almost spot on with moving average analysis. Comparing their 50-day and 200-day moving average, they're currently on a bullish trend, positive upward momentum to a higher stock price. The short term moving average is above the long term line, thus indicating they're in for a good run in the near future. 

**COVID Vaccines**

We know that the Biden administration is pushing for vaccinations. For good reason: once we're at herd immunity, states will be opening up because they're in need for revenue after incurring major expenses to keep their hospitals and small businesses staffed and opened during the height of the pandemic. Today we learned that the Biden administration is moving up their timeline to distribute vaccines after Pfizer and Moderna made a deal to provide 200 million shots. Once people are vaccinated to the threshold of herd immunity, the economy will start moving in the right direction. And, remember, Simon is trading a discount now. Once people feel more comfortable being around others, mall traffic can expect to increase.

**Summary**

I know some of you see the market as a casino, but I know a lot of you don't even have money to buy into a poker game at a low-class joint and are holding your wife's boyfriend's dicks shell-shocked at the change of market tides. But, if you bet on America, you can never go wrong. Once sentiment changes, if it has already curved in the right direction, businesses will attract the traffic. Maybe not pre-pandemic levels for some, but their stock price will rise as we get closer. SPG is primed for a return built on solid fundamentals (curse word in this sub?), an upward trend based on chart analysis, and growing confidence in our ability to be around others after much fatigue. Right now, betting on America is wagering if we can make a recovery. And when have we been unable to recover as a country?

Title: FCX dd-Copper is in a breakout from recent highs and someone looks to be manipulating the worlds biggest copper miner(FCX)downward to scoop up shares on the cheap on the heels of the upcoming bull run, plus more DD
Ok guys, this seems like its gonna be pretty big. Copper by all technical indicators has broken out and is in price discovery due to mines being shut down, historically low stockpiles, reopening demands, inevitable inflation, and an upcoming EV boom.

[Heres someone way smarter than this retard confirming my beliefs.](https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/technical/article/fx_technical_weekly/2021/02/10/copper-price-outlook-bullish-as-breakout-begins.html)

The past three days have been huge for copper, ending up with a net gain of almost 3.59% which for copper is pretty fucking big. 

Yesterday morning it was also upgraded to a buy by JPM. After starting the morning out +6% it dropped hard during that market wide dip. Now keep in mind FCX is not the hottest stock in the world so its volume is pretty low. I have no proof but given its low volume it would be extremely easy to manipulate downwards so you can load up. After speculating why this could be happening all day, it happened.

**AT CLOSE SOMEONE IMMEDIATELY PURCHASED 2.74 MILLION SHARES**

[Order book screenshot](https://ibb.co/tMKDwGD)

2.74M shares, 85 Million dollars worth.

While the rest of the market slowly recovered the rest of the day FCX continued to walk downwards and ended at -2.5% on a day where copper was +1.5%. Add in the day before where where it opened low and ended flat when copper had another 1.5%, and today again where copper ended up +.2% and FCX was for some reason down again at -.8%. Again keep in mind that FCX is super low volume so manipulating it would be expensive but easy.

The charts from FCX and the copper index ETF (CPER) generally mirror eachother and is pretty easily verifiable by looking at the charts. Well until recently that is, they both peaked on 1/14, the last time copper was at its recent high, the CPER etf is up 2.8% since then and for some extremely strange reason FCX is down 3.2%. That is a 6% deviation on genuine boomer metrics. As of today there were no massive buys AH but who inows whats going on in dark pools as my broker is showing its up AH on zero volume.

I know copper has been in an epic run but factor in the upcoming EV boom with a supply shortage and copper is most likely poised to shoot past all time highs with supply at historic lows and demand soon to be at an all time high. Feel free to look at the FCX all time chart to see how parabolic runs are a frequent thing in their history and we may be entering one.

Am I really eating crayons? DYOR and decide for yourself.

First and only thing you really need to know is **RGB = buy.** 

But since this sub has been infiltrated by paper handed wrinklebrain-bears, heres why I am on my way to the moon...

*********************** 
**RECAP**

Breif history of CRSR, the stock blew up post IPO from $17, riding epic gaming industry performance throughout the pandemic.  It hit a high above $51 in Sept '20 before correcting and trading between $41 and $36. The float is low so swings are volatile. Also lots of short volume consolidating. 

**1/13** - a little stock called G M E more than doubled in a day causing to CRSR tank to $36 with some momentum. Possibly a direct result of liquidation to buy into the squeeze (retail and/or institutional....Citadel is 2% owner of CRSR float)

Cool, so now the stock is oversold, it starts climbing back to normal levels as it had been, then ...

**1/27** - CRSR announces a secondary PO of 7.5 million shares...it hits a high of $49, before a 2 day selloff.  Crash Boogaloo.

After the selloff it picks up momentum running up to the 2/9 earnings report, with expectations of excellent numbers. IV is through the roof. Debate kicks off whether earnings are already priced in and an IV crush was inevitable.

**2/9**  -  **CRSR delivers an amazing earnings report.** $1.7B revenue for the year, profit margins way up, debt is down, and they said THEY HAVE SO MUCH DEMAND THEY CAN BARELY KEEP UP WITH IT.  After this amazing ER, the stock tops out at about $48 premarket....before nosediving, nearly hitting $40. 

Now many were saying that the runup to the ER was all just hype, so of course it tanked like LOGI and all the rest. 

But looking at what actually happned, it wasn't actually just hype. The pre-ER runup was almost all attributable to upward correction from the previous 2 selloffs.  The only reason it crashed was because other companies crashed post earnings in 2021, so paper hands sold in expectation of the IV crush... self-fulfilling prophecy.   

So the price starts to fall into oversold territory. Quote from Barron's "Of the 11 analysts that cover the stock 10 rate it a Buy, and one has a Hold rating on the name." Literally almost thinks this thing is a bull. 

But then yesterday some genius at Goldman decides to downgrade the stock to "Neutral" from "Buy", causing the selloff to dip even lower, hitting just above $40. Their justification? They think gaming demand could wane in 2021, and also are worried about the fact that CRSR hasn't been able to meet 100% of demand due to shortages of Semiconductors. 

**************************************************************************
**CURRENT SITUATION**

That brings us to today. CRSR is way oversold. $1.7B profitable revenue....$3.9B market cap, pitiful. Almost every analyst, including Goldman, has increased their price targets, many above $50. 

Compare that to LOGI..$2.9B R ($4.4B+ TTM), at $19.9B market cap and climbing fast.  Speaking of LOGI, check out this [chart](https://imgur.com/3ORH329). 1/19 Post-Earnings dip, before running to ATH 2 weeks later. 

But price is still down, why?

Maybe has to do with the fact that the short volume has been above 50% every day finally dipped below yesterday for the first time  in months. http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html

Or maybe a bunch of boomer bears actually think the gaming industry will pull back (we've already seen this isn't going to happen anytime soon.)

And what also happened today? The P OTUS just announced they were launching an initiative to ease the semiconductor shortage. Exactly the thing holding back CRSR from meeting demand, and one of the factors leading to Goldman downgrade.  

Without the shortages, there's nothing holding this company back from achieving full earnings potential.This is a $65-$70 stock EASY. You will not beat this entry point. 

**TL;DR** RGB = Buy. Get on the .

Title: GME historical survey of the systemic problem of shorting non-existing stock (naked shorting) in relation to recent events
Full disclosure, stolen from r/options.

A Case story of Naked Shorting in GME
TLDR:Naked shorting appears prevalent in GME, and if true was likely aided by DTCC, whom by extension may have shut down the short squeeze on 1/28 because it would've caused a massive scandal had the squeeze happened. I know ape can't read but I implore you to read the whole thing (originally wasn't going to add a TLDR but decided to add it just so more people will read even just a little bit)
I was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME. I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes. This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle, I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now:
One of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226%, and later in the range of 150% percent of total float. Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs (https://wherearetheshares.com/). Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal. In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist (there are many analysis and data points pointing to this but just one example:/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/). Where do these shares come from? One potential explanation is synthetic long shares (created via a loophole described here/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/) or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting.
Im an entrepreneur, not a finance expert, so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject. I started with thishttps://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm. Failures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale. There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver. For example, human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book-entry form, thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three-day settlement period.A fail may also result from naked short selling.
Interesting. We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond, an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time.
According to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox, Abusivenaked short sales... can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock priceto the detriment of all of its investors. The Commission is particularly concerned aboutpersistent failures to deliver in the marketfor some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO, adopted just two years ago Selling short without having stock available for delivery, andintentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three-day settlement period, is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect thatsubstantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities.Specifically, these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership - voting, lending, and dividends from issuers. Moreover,they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price. (Source:https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm)
In a different speech Mr Cox re-iterated that short selling helps prevent "irrational exuberance and bubbles. Butwhen someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market  it is undermining it.Mr Cox also referred to "the serious problem of abusive naked short sales as a tool to drive down a company's stock price" and that the SEC is "concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due toloopholes in Regulation SHO" (which reminds me of this piece I wrote/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/) (source for SEC Chairmans words:https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm)
As another datapoint, Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed thatnaked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground. (Source: This was originally in a time magazine article from 2005 which was deletedhttps://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.htmlbut the statement still exists in record in an SEC Filing from 2008https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm)
I also read One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's sharesfor as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create "phantom" or "counterfeit" shares, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, andartificially depressing the share price. Shortly after, I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers. Taibbi said that the two firms got a "push" into extinction from "a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling". (Source:https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall_streets_naked_swindle)
All these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted, which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed. If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage, GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen -- potentially even an infinite short squeeze. On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB. The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze, the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze.
On 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre-trading started (the stock shot up to 513 in pre-trading) and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day, the momentum was suddenly shut down when Robinhood (where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on) were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling, followed by several other brokers. Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying (but funds were not.) When this happened people were upset at Robinhood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between Robinhood and Citadel (which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2.5 billion to Melvin Capital, one of the short side funds, and is also responsible for something like 40% of Robinhoods entire revenue by buying their order books), but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself. Now, personally speaking, its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this. However, looking into the details of what happened, a skeptical part of me became suspicious.
Apparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to Robinhood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars (https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/) . So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening. On that day, there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen. Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond (which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze), hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag. Worse, DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing, I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least.
Then I read something that caught my eye DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts. From an article dating back to 2007, Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp. is a little-known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers. About 99% of the time, trades are completed without incident. But about 1% of the shares -- valued at about $2.5 billion on a given a day -- aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days, for one reason or another.These "failures to deliver" have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices. (Source:https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720)
Apparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time. According to Wall Street Journal There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens. The fight is over how prevalent the problem is -- and the extent to which DTCC is responsible. Some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens. DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern. (Source:https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720).
"It has been alleged intens or hundreds of lawsuits that the DTCC and itsPrime Broker owners have abused their monopoly position to create numerous techniques that allow for the creation of counterfeit shares through naked shortingthat facilitate stock manipulation by hedge funds. Law suits have been brought against Merrell. Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, UBS, other market makers and also the DTCC. The Prime Brokers and DTCC have fought back ferociously against these lawsuits with great success andhave been largely successful in blocking attempts to gain access to their transaction data bases. The information that they do release is incomplete, self-serving and misleading. (Source:https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/)
As a thought experiment, lets say naked shorting is rampant in GME (many many indicators point to this) and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on GME, wouldnt it be in their best interest to make sure this doesnt get out and blow up in their faces? Something to consider. Because had they not done what they did on 1/29 Thursday, many traders believe the squeeze wouldve happened that day.
From the Wall Street Journal: The Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice. The latest move came last month, when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale. Butsome critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months. Until that failure is resolved, there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account, critics say.This "phantom stock" can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.(source:https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720)
From everything Ive seen, as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1/26, many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented. I personally hold the following hypothesis:

GME shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221% and 150% at various times, and as late as 1/29 reported by S3 to be 122%https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314

GME shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs (/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/) and using those to cover their positions but not truly covering, which is illegal to cover using this particular method, and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed, potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close

As a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more GME shares then the actual float

The counterfeit shares can/have been used inaggressive naked short attacksto further drive down the price of GME, which may have led to the precipitous price drop starting last Monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able toartificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shares

Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to, DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts, mayve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in GME

There was potentially collusion on 1/29 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts, it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed.

Also, acompelling theoryput forth by someone on what the 800 dollar calls were for and how they could be used to cancel out naked shorts includes data/graphs, recommend giving it a read

Title: Why US Cannabis Stocks Need to be a Part of Your Portfolio 
It's simple...if you don't have exposure to US cannabis stocks you're going to miss out on a hell of a ride that's already begun happening.

**Here is why I'm right**  **** **:**

* **WSB** has turned their sites to heavily shorted US cannabis stonks -- this brings a lot more exposure
* Democrats have the House, Senate and Presidency as many believe its the US's turn for **legalization** like what we saw in Canada (think of the Green rush of 2017-2018) 
* Opens up **exporting** to the world for many of these companies if federally cannabis is finally removed as schedule 1 drug 
* US cannabis stocks have been hit really hard the last 2 trading days and have provided a new opportunity to **load up on the dip before the legalization rip** 
* **MSOs** (Multi State Operators) and in a league of their own and the graphic below is a really small but easy way of proving that

This is a really great and detailed read into this as well: [https://www.investors.com/news/marijuana-stocks-good-buy/](https://www.investors.com/news/marijuana-stocks-good-buy/)

Ultimately, if you believe cannabis will be a big industry than its important to have exposure in MSOs and with this recent pullback, now could be a great time to either start or create a position.

Title: AMD, safe long term investment?
Hi all, 

I am a newbie here and after the memes of GME, I actually became interested in the stock market. 

This has probably already been shared before, but I would like your input too, as I said, I'm new here. 

I saw AMD somewhere and I was interested in it. I bought in without doing my DD. But I think I have accidentally made a smart move if I hold. 

According to Patrick Schur. The new Tesla model S will use AMD chips. [source](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/joao-silva/updated-tesla-model-s-infotainment-system-to-feature-a-10-tflop-navi-23-gpu/)

Could this be a sensible long term investment?

The news screams at us that the market is over valued. Time and time again a company has $40bn market cap on a measly $2bn revenue with $500mm profits. Who in their right minds would say a company is worth $40bn when it would take 80 years to see ROI. OVER VALUED TRASH. Even UBER report billions in losses but institutional investors are still riding a wave on overvalued trash, why shouldn't we do the same? 

GME is a good buy compared to loads of other OVER VALUED trash on the market. 

&gt;People talk up the demise of GameStop yet here they are about to generate over $2b in revs in a single quarter at the tail end of a console cycle. - u/deepfuckingvalue 

$2bn in revenue in a quarter is not bad. In 2020, GME had revenues of $6.5bn with $300mm in losses down from $8.3 revenue with $491mm in losses in 2019--their worst year since each year before they were turning a profit. Amid a global pandemic GME manages to hold onto revenue and contain losses, they even came close to a profit in Q420 with only $20mm in losses down from $84mm in Q419--amid a global pandemic with Q420 ending in October and not including holiday sales.

Look at UBER and SNAP. In 2020, UBER had $14.15bn in revenue AND $8.6 BILLION IN LOSSES yet currently $113bn market cap. OVER VALUED TRASH WITH HUGE LOSSES. Or SNAP. In 2020 it had $2.5bn in revenue, $945mm in losses and currently has $94bn market cap. OVER VALUED TRASH WITH HUGE LOSSES. 

If GME is over valued trash like these smart buys then it must be valued at $100bn, maybe $50bn. But wait, GME market cap rests at a modest $3.4bn. WTF?? So you mean to say GME's revenues are 2x its stock market value while closing in on losses but UBER and SNAP are killer buys with $100bn market cap with no end to their bleeding $$. THE EXPERTS SAY ITS BECAUSE THE SHIFT TO DIGITAL!!!

&gt;The shift to digital thesis is way overblown. - u/deepfuckingvalue

The financial news screams at us saying digital has killed brick in mortar, blah blah blah, we live inside computers now--see PROOF we are on WSB ALL DAY!! If brick and mortar were dead then why would Amazon purchase Whole Foods? Why do companies like PELOTON have retail stores ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY? Why did e-commerce sales only represent 11% of all retail sales in the US in 2019? BECAUSE THE SHIFT TO DIGITAL IS WAY OVERBLOW BULLSHIT THEY FEED US.

GME has losses, sure, but they are containing costs with revenue exceeds their entire stock market value. GME is bringing in loads of $$ and their nearly contained losses are way under leading trash-buy stocks like UBER and SNAP. Brick and mortar is alive even in a pandemic--just wait until after the pandemic. People like to visit shops and get their buy on quickly--that's why AMZ bought Whole Foods and online retail only represents a fraction of brick and mortar retail sales. GME is not going anywhere anytime soon. GME is undervalued compared to the rest of the trash on the overvalued market. That's why I'm holding, will stop looking at the ticker price, and will no longer join in discussion about GME on WSB. 

See you all in the summer of 21    

This is not financial advice. I have no idea what I'm talking about. I just like the stock.

Title: ROXG.TO Due Diligence. This is my only mining stock and I am quite bullish on it, here's why.
Roxgold Inc., a GOLD mining company (can't go wrong with Gold!), engages in acquiring, exploring, and evaluating mineral properties. Holds interest the Yaramoko gold project located in Burkina Faso; and 100% interest in Sgula gold project, which include 11 mineral exploration permits situated in Cte dIvoire. The company is headquartered in Toronto, Canada.   


According to a Businesswire Article ([link](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005267/en/)): "A year ago, Roxgold announced the discovery of the Boussoura Project and has since drilled over 150 holes with consistent assay returns demonstrating broad intersections of mineralization with lower grade halos surrounding higher grade quartz veins  characteristic of the style of mineralization found within the prolific Hound Gold Belt. The Boussoura Project is still in its early days, yet we are growing more confident in the scale of this project, with a large land package host to numerous veined corridors running over extensive strike lengths and with numerous targets identified between Fofora and Galgouli with similar geochemistry and geophysical anomalies. We will continue to keep the drills turning at Boussoura, as we look to continue to expand and define the mineralized footprint towards the goal of a maiden resource by year end."

I had my friend (in the geology field) to look over their assay results and he's let me know that they are fairly significant.  


You may be concerned about mining in Africa, especially a country like BF. This is a valid concern, governments have not always been favorable to mining in Africa. It seems however, that BF has switched gears and is starting to move in a positive direction, the country has even eliminated a 10% tax on mining operations.

Title: I'm on for $ON
ON Semiconductors. 

We all know we're in a current market shortage of semiconductors. You can see this in the retail markets with GPU and CPU shortages, but we also have a shortage in the industrial sectors too. Our modern economy is rife with robots and computers everywhere from factories to your living room. All of those electronics need semiconductors and chips. 

$ON makes Memory, they make audio processors, they make LCD drivers, they make switches, sim card readers, thermal sensors, light readers, motor drivers, DC regulator, and USB controllers. [They make all the shit that makes robots work,](https://www.onsemi.com/products) and they make custom solutions too. 

We all know that robots are taking over our jobs, and that robots have been storming manufacturing for the last decade. Now $ON sits on a huge demand for these parts because the other companies like MU and TSM are spending all their resources trying to meet the big GPU and CPU demands. 

Other manufacturing is getting left behind in the semiconductor shortage. We still need automotive robot arms to build new cars, whether they're green or gas. We still need logic and power solutions for every manufacturing or appliance part that needs to move. That means assembly line robots, it means motor controls for cnc machines and shop equipment, it means the power solution for your oven and microwave, it even means the GFCI controller that stops you from ending it all after you lost it on GME when you tried to bathe with the toaster, which uses a power switch, which are made by $ON. 

But don't take my word for it. Look at it's charts. 
[here's the 3 month.](https://i.imgur.com/YDuwykA.png?1)
[here's the 6 month.](https://i.imgur.com/RZo5uTD.png?1)
[and here's all time.](https://i.imgur.com/RZo5uTD.png?1)

This thing is primed to go, and already creeping up steadily on the fundamentals. It's already a mainstream company in the manufacturing world, a big name. I think its primed to continue to moon as the current shortage deepens with the ever increasing advancement to smaller and smaller nanonmeter fabrication techniques by the GPU and CPU manufacturers.

Title: A stock that goes up on American retardation - a sure fire $CBDT/$EPWCF DD
Introduction - Fuck you - 50000 Shares @ 42 cents  


CBDT/EPWCF is an already established US and Canadian clinic that has transitioned into the Covid Market for max gains.  


These fucks have been doing minimum 1-2k+ tests PER DAY, since LAST OCTOBER - AT $99 USD PER TEST THIS IS AT THE LOWEST  ROUGHLY 2.97M PER MONTH FROM TESTS ALONE.  


This doesn't even include their own purchasable take home test from KaiLabs (which CBDT/EPWCF purchased) (1)  


Just recently, Empower Clinics has made an agreement with Rexall (Massive pharmacy chain in Canada) to make healthcare centres.(2) THEY ALSO JUST GOT APPROVED BY HEALTH CANADA TO SELL COVID TESTS IN STORES - REXALL BEING ONE OF THEM. (3) Empower effectively has already established clinics, printing cash in both the States and Canada.  


Ready for this shit?   


Have an agreement to do DAILY covid testing at Dallas Market Centre - 5 million square feet. Where they expected to do 8000 tests in January (more than the entirety of Q4) (4)  


Thought that was it? Nope, they also got an agreement with movie studios to do all the covid testing before production. (5)  


Not only do they have tests, they are involved with Medicinal Marijuana AND the new upcoming psychedelic market. (6)  


In my retard opinion - this is an easy $5 stock by year end with all the agreements that have been made this year, along with all previous ongoing agreements. They constantly buy and hold clinics across Canada and the US and have made a name for themselves already.

Title: $AMKR gapped up today but I think it's still undervalued
Amkor is a superconductor packaging company. Boring af. Think cardboard company selling boxes to Amazon. But they've got: 
-solid earnings track record ($1.39/s TTM)
-low PE (9.18 FWD looking)
-upward trajectory earnings estimates ($1.69/s projected this year)
-a large portion of the market share selling B2B in an industry that has been killing it for years.

I usually skip on companies that beat earnings and gap up cause I figure I missed the boat. But I think this still has room to run. They've broken out of the 20 day SMA on the news this week of an earnings beat (Monday) that they will be added to the S&amp;P midcap 400 (yesterday). **This means index etfs will start scooping up shares.** And Citi analyst price target increases today to $15 from $13 https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-amkor-technology-stock-just-jumped-again-2021-02-11

Granted it's currently trading well above that higher price target but it seems analysts are rarely willing to reach ahead of an uptrending stock, and they just follow it up with trailing estimates. What's more important is the fact that they found reason to move it at all.

Do your research, tell me why I'm wrong. I am long shares.

Title: $EWJ - JOIN MICHAEL BURRY IN AN ETF WITH CONCRETE POSITIVE GROWTH
Earlier this week, our beloved Dr. Michael Burry (the dude who predicted the housing crisis, the dude who predicted GME, the dude who predicts fucking everything honestly), tweeted about Japan finally lifting their iron coffin lid as he called it. While this tweet is now deleted, as Burry frequently wipes his Twitter, it led me down a hole which I believe to have discovered a golden opportunity. This iron coffin lid of Japans has been rumored to break free for a while now, but hasnt. 

[https://moneyweek.com/476357/the-charts-that-matter-can-japan-lift-the-iron-coffin-lid](https://moneyweek.com/476357/the-charts-that-matter-can-japan-lift-the-iron-coffin-lid) 

[https://www.economicperspectives.co.uk/japanese-equities-can-the-coffin-lid-be-lifted.html](https://www.economicperspectives.co.uk/japanese-equities-can-the-coffin-lid-be-lifted.html) 

Yet, Burry believes the time has finally come. As such he is heavenly invested in Japanese corporations. 

An excerpt from Burrys tweet: #ironcoffinlid opening? If so, the contents are the likes of which are never seen in the western world.

This led me to find, $EWJ. An ETF consisting of **85% OF JAPANS STOCKS**. (Thats a lot!). No, you didn't read that wrong. Not 85% of EWJ consists of Japanese stock, EWJ consists of roughly 85% of the investible universe of securities traded in Japan. 

Some of the top companies that they hold the majority of their equity in include:

**NINTENDO**

**SONY**

**TOYOTA**

**MITSUBISHI**

**TOKYO ELECTRON**

**SOFTBANK GROUP**

I mean wow, what a stacked top contenders list.

**Nintendo only has positive year after year growth**, and after the revolution of the Switch, they are back on their feet with eyes forward. 

**Sony only has positive year after year growth.** Sony is a company that pioneers technology in all aspects, video-games, TV, music, etc. 

**Toyota only has positive year after year growth.** I expect this to skyrocket as well as we transition to the age of EVs. *Earlier this week Toyota announced their electric vehicles are coming THIS YEAR. Toyota also recently partnered with PANASONIC to manufacture their batteries for said EVs.* 

**While Mitsubishi has had their ups and downs, we still see a net positive year after year return.** Mitsubishi is Japans *LARGEST TRADING COMPANY. With HIGH POSITIVE OUTLOOK FOR THE FUTURE IN 2022+ AS THEY MOVE INTO EVs AS WELL.*

**Tokyo Electron** **only has positive year after year growth**. Going from a penny stock to $100 in less than 5 years, Tokyo Electron is looking like a very serious worldwide company moving forward. Founded in 1963, Tokyo Electron has been a manufacturer of ***semiconductors***, technology for the future that they have been pioneering for 50 YEARS NOW. You know all the people spamming $ON on here? That is a semiconductor play as well. This is just a safer gateway into that industry.

**SoftBank Group only has positive year after year growth.** Softbank is *THE WORLDS LARGEST TECHNOLOGY FOCUSED VENTURE CAPITAL FUND, WITH OVER 100 BILLION DOLLARS IN CAPITAL.* 

These 6 are simply a very small few of EWJs top holdings. As you can see the road ahead is bright, almost blinding. EWJ took a dip during COVID, but is now coming out of that hole stronger and faster. If we take a look at EWJs chart we can see a lot of consistent breakout patterns occurring recently, lining up with Burrys idea. 

Lets take a look at the covid dip:

![img](uzamwpn52rg61 "
")

As we can see in early 2020 when we saw covid happen, the 100-day average passed downward through the 20-day average, as we spiral down. **However, we then see one of the quickest recoveries ever during the pandemic** as already in April the 20 day average passes through the 100 day and we begin our flight to the moon.

I decided to snoop around WSB and see if anyone else was talking about this. I stumbled upon u/ThePoorLads post where he also notes a breakout pattern. His image below:

https://preview.redd.it/n940mw4c2rg61.jpg?width=1075&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21596b94408506af11a5e4d6194aea781644fca2

Yet, let's continue snooping around EWJs graph and see if we find anything worth paying attention to..  

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dpwmvnqf2rg61.png?width=2491&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61b4742d4d90a07ad232773274535275a04b52d3

As you can see, this week we have a very prevailing and very bullish staircase pattern, this following Burrys tweet, seems to be the beginning of EWJs true soar to 100+. 

The options for EWJ have little to no volume. They are cheap as fuck. This is a stock no one fucking knows about. It just seems like a random Japan ETF, who would want to get in on that? No one realizes what's about to happen, (except our boy Burry). This is a golden opportunity to get in before the crowd. 

Look at these **2023 LEAPS**, 20 FUCKING 23, and look how cheap they are.

EWJ has gone up $30 alone in the past half-year, and that is without this "iron coffin lid" rising. In my opinion, EWJ will EASILY hit 105 in **2021, let alone 2022 or 2023**. Take a look at the rest of the call sheet, yourself, they are cheap as fuck. 

Earlier this week Financial Times posted an article talking about how Japanese stocks are climbing to their highest levels since 1991. The stars are all aligning.

Position: 2023 100C @ 105

**TLDR:** *Michael Burry believes Japans iron coffin lid will open to the likes of things that the western world has never seen. $EWJ only has positive growth potential and is about to break out. Options are also cheap as fuck. Moon mission has already begun.*  **

LIVE EDIT: As I write this, the prices for some of these calls are sky rocketing, while still mantaining little to no volume. I just witnessed some 0.01 calls go up 2800% off EWJ going up 5 cents. Jesus christ.

Title: Want some new stupid things to throw money at? Hint: Shrooms 
If people think pot is the next thing then theyre 3 years too late. The next thing is Psilocybin. You may know it as shrooms. 
There are several companies working on medicines and real world use. States are waking up to this too... as is the federal government. 

Several states have legalized shrooms for recreational use and some medicines are working their way through the FDA. Heres some DD (that isnt mine):
[Shroom investing](https://investingnews.com/daily/life-science-investing/psychedelics-investing/psychedelics-stocks-to-watch/)

I have some positions and favs:
CMPS - one of the biggest fish with a market cap over 1.7B
MMEDF - working on medicines and therapeutics with a focus on psychedelics 
SHRMF - working on some bipolar meds and some ketamine treatments (yea theyre bringing ketamine back)


Do your own research. Im not a financial advisor. I am long these 3 and think theyre the next blue skies field. Happy to answer questions.

Title: Get in on $ON $TSM $AMD now
[https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order)

Every huge company in the world is missing semiconductors: "companies like Apple, Qualcomm, Sony, and AMD have all cited shortages in recent weeks, with effects ranging from part shortages for iPhones to the incredibly hard-to-find nature of the PlayStation 5 or AMDs newest CPUs and GPUs. But in todays increasingly connected world, a shortage of semiconductor chips impacts not only traditional technology industries, but also a wide-ranging list of other industries. Numerous automotive companies  including Volkswagen, Fiat Chrysler, and Toyota  have been forced to temporarily suspend vehicle production over the past several months. And Ford just announced that it would be pausing manufacturing on its most lucrative F-150 trucks earlier this month in the wake of chip shortages." 

All these companies are just begging for more semi-conductors, and $ON and others are almost completely out. When production starts ramping up again the huge demand will increase their earnings even more: THIS IS A LONG AND SHORT PLAY.

I'm getting ready to buy shares and a few LEAPS.

$ON destroyed its earnings call and is ready to fly once this news gets bigger.

Positions: $ON 4/16 40c

Title: $TAKOF - Drone Delivery Canada About To Rocket Into Space (DD)
This stock has been quite bullish lately and on a steady rise every day. For Canadians the stock is called FLT on TSX &amp; is on the same rate. Both cheap buys with the potential of multi multi bag holder potential. Their biggest drones can carry 400lbs and has a range of 200km. They service mines, first nations areas, cargo ships &amp; lots of other hard to find areas. They are currently getting contracts to carry out vaccines &amp; much more. They're doing quite well right now with growing their business in the scope just discussed. Letters of intent, delivery contracts and no reason to stop growing. 


But if we're going to talk about long term potential, it's not limited to delivery of packages either. DDC has goodwill and trust from regulatory bodies. There aren't many companies doing what they're doing, and no one knows how to regulate airspace. DDC now has a track record of doing it, and maintains their open cooperative relationship with Transport Canada and other regulatory bodies. So when other countries start thinking about how to safely integrate drones into their airspace, who will they come to?


Finally, in my opinion they should be nicely positioned to expand into other areas with the expertise they develop from operating the package delivery drones. Human transportation (air taxi) drones, and industrial inspection and maintenance are examples of adjacent industries that have great growth potential and not a lot of competition. DDC will have built expertise that can pave the way there. Point being, they're not going to be limited to delivering packages. Not sure if they'll just spin off another company if they decided to do that... they are called Drone Delivery after all. It's just my take on it. In for 16327 shares $0.68 avg.

**Latest Catalysts:** Drone Delivery Canada plans to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) into its disruptive drone delivery solution (Source 4); Drone Delivery Canada has been named to the 2021 OTCQX Best 50 (Source 5); In January 2021, the FAA added new rules to 14 CFR Part 107 to permit the expansion of routine flights and created four categories of UAS for flights over suburban/urban areas (Source 6)

**Upcoming Catalysts:** release of Q4 and 2020 results; in July company started process to entering US market  at some point there will be announcement if this is a success.

**Industry Catalyst:** establishment of a legal basis for unmanned cargo air vehicles, battery technology and wireless charging developments.

Research by Goldman Sachs suggests the market potential could be as big as US$100 billion (CA$130 billion). Meanwhile, startups in the sector are nearly all worth less than $1 billion today (source 7  claims $TAKOF has multi-bagger also discusses $TAKOF cash position).

Title: GluMobile - a hidden GME (I mean gem!)
\[ *I'm not a financial advisor, and I'm not telling anyone to do anything, I'm just sharing a theory of what might happen with $GLUU over the next few weeks, or months* \]

**TL;DR;** Because of a lot of open interest in $13 and $14 calls, low volume and super low IV, heavy buying of either GLUU shares or $12-$14 GLUU calls could send the stock parabolic because of a Gamma Squeeze, which could push it even higher because of a Short Squeeze.

**The Story**

You probably didn't notice it, but GluMobile (GLUU) absolutely killed earnings and popped some 33% on the day, from around $9 to $12.50. Here's why I think it may go higher, and see it as a good candidate for the next short/gamma squeeze, like we saw in GME and AMC.

For one, it was even featured in an article on [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/these-stocks-loved-by-analysts-but-hated-by-hedge-funds-could-be-the-next-squeeze-candidates.html), about stocks that analysts have and think has a huge upside, but a **big short interest,** therefore making it a good candidate for a **short squeeze**.

Next, let's talk options chains and a potential for a big **gamma squeeze**. \[*For those that don't know, Gamma squeezes were responsible for parabolic moves in GME and AMC, where the more calls ended up being in the money, market makers had to buy more and more and more shares to hedge, pushing the prices higher, making more calls in the money, and creating a huge spiralling effect.*\]

If you look at options for 2/19 and 3/19, there's over 10,000 lucky number $13 calls right now:

[2\/19 options chain](https://preview.redd.it/ddim6aufmwg61.png?width=1916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad46dc713edf357679407d104d1819e9a82fb824)

As you can see, $13 calls are trading for pennies, with barely .20 delta, which means that our friends, the Market Makers, don't really think this would get to $13 by 2/19 (or even 3/19).

Notice also that IV is super low right now, because MM's don't think this is a volatile stock with aggressive moves. If they end up being surprised by a volatility surge, they would end up scrambling to buy shares to hedge.

So - in the scenario where there is some sudden **volatility**, and price **jumps above $13**, there are a number of ways a person holding $13-$15 calls would benefit from that.

* First, **if IV jumps, value of your calls jump**, easy. That's the opposite of IV crush, and it also causes delta to go higher, which forces MMs to buy shares to hedge.
* If price goes above $13, **your call value goes up by the value of delta** ($0.20), so that's 5x what it's worth now ($0.05).
* Most importantly, our excellent friend **Gamma** comes into play. $13 Call Gamma is stupid high (0.56) which means that, if price goes above $13, our friends **MMs would have to buy about 11,180 \* 100 \* 0.56  = 626,000 of GLUU shares to hedge**

Since GLUU doesn't trade with a lot of volume, a big purchase like this, would likely push the price higher, and well above $13. If there's enough buying going on, it may even go to $14.

Then, what happens? We get another Gamma boost from $14 calls, and market makers have to go and buy another 80,000 of GLUU shares to hedge.

That, my friends, is a Gamma Squeeze. When calls get in the money, think of it as speed ramps that shoot prices further up. If they do, shorts starts getting scared and start covering, shooting prices further up.

**So, what am I doing?** Loading up on $13 2/19 and $13 3/19 calls. I will test my theory myself.

And another thing - if there are really hedge fund bots scraping WSB, a good thing to do if they saw this post was bump IV and make these calls more expensive. Let's see if that happens.

Title: Panasonic - Possibly Good For Future
Trying to get away from all these retarded meme stocks and pump and dumps and present something that may have potential in the future.

Panasonic. 

As you probably already know, Panasonic already has a deal with Tesla for batteries, however Musk wants to produce his own soon but that deal lasts until 2022 I believe. 

Just last year, Panasonic entered a [deal](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greggardner/2020/02/03/toyota-and-panasonic-launch-joint-ev-battery-venture/?sh=61a565dd4c3a) to jointly produce lithium ion batteries. They also plant to set up a [factory](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-toyota-panasonic-batteries/toyota-panasonic-venture-to-build-lithium-ion-batteries-for-hybrids-in-japan-idUSKBN26R0LW) in 2022 which will produce lithium ion batteries for more than 500k cars a year. As EV vehicles come into prominence, I think Toyota's position will be unique as Toyota is consistent and dead set on quality. 

Panasonic is trading at $13 right now and I think it is a good buy that will pay off in the future.

Title: $SNDL (SUNDIAL GROWERS)

DAYS PRICE IS ABOVE $1 (Nasdaq delist): 8/

I know none of u are gonna read an entire paragraph so heres some pictures nd a quick search/summary.

6. https://ibb.co/9qcR3hc


Summary:
- $SNDL being shorted
- They are now debt free, while others weed stocks are filled with debt. 
- SNDL has lots of potential and many plans of development
- +Weed (once fully legal)
- under valued, compare other weed stonks, most around $20-$30 avg and yes those are for larger companies but whos to say SNDL wont grow, so far theyve been making smart business decisions.
- This is not a quick pump and dump. $Sndl has potential and; long term hold. Many others and I see the real potential of $SNDL and We holding long.



Common misconceptions nd questions?:

- Why is cannabis Shorted
-Cannabis has been getting heavily shorted for quite some time because of legalization, shorts have made it very difficult for this life changing industry to flourish the way it should. 

- Is cannabis industry over rated
-No, cannabis stocks are overrated when they are $50+ before legalization and/or heavy sales. Which is the case with some marijuana stocks. But $SNDL was well under a $1, for a growing cannabis industry; this is highly undervalued. We are not saying $SNDL should be around the other popular mainstream cannabis stocks. But it should at least be higher $5-$15.

- Sndl is Canadian , legalisation is US-
-Yes, you dont think being able to expand nd distribute to US markets will help to grow?

- why was $Sndl preforming bad before
-1They had bad managment, the new ceo Zach will turn it around you can see in pics above. 2Marijuana industry wasnt as recognized before. 3 They were faced with huge set backs, if you look at one of the articles below. They had 2 fires which resulted in huge loss of products, floods, humidity control issues, and leaks. Yet they managed to stay debt free. This was all not in their hands and due to having a shit location and poor building management/control.

- cannabis industry has political issues
-well for starter, the marijuana industry is no longer going to have those political issues with the Biden administration hopefully pushing it forward. Also, regarding SNDL the stock is highly undervalued compared to other weed stocks. Which doesnt make sense because yea theyve had major setbacks but somehow theyre debt free. Its a cannabis company that looks to be making smart business decisions plus the new ceo will make a positive change, we are not saying its the next canopy or are trying to promote it as the leading cannabis stock. But instead we are trying to show you a potential stock that can boom due to being undervalued. To add on, SNDL is heavily shorted which brings a possibility of a small squeeze. They have until June to keep their share price above $1 for 10days or it will get delisted. So far the price is heading in the right direction.

- EDIT:regarding the comment about 1b market cap nd if it can reach 5b:Ok looking at SNDL market cap its currently at 1.3b and the company wasnt even doing that well before because of major set backs I mentioned above, so you dont think after having a new ceo, and making smarter business moves; that its possible for it to reach a 5b market cap, almost all cannabis companies are average round or close to 5b market cap, and none of them seem to be generating any high revenue, because cannabis is still under full legalization. And if youre wondering what smart business moves SNDL made, well for starter they are debt freewhile many/all other marijuana stocks are still piled with debt. SNDL is debt free after going through two fires that caused massive losses and constantly burning through cash, like all other cannabis stocks. Look at this article here: https://www.google.com/s/www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/03/3-pot-stocks-to-avoid-like-the-plague-in-february/  you can see most cannabis stocks arent generating any revenue and there all burning through cash and filled with debt except SNDL has no more debtand here in this article: https://www.google.com/s/www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-sundial-growers-planning-a-splashy-deal-2021-01-22%3 you can see how they are trying to possibly expand. so a $5b cap is quite realistic.

- EDIT: You guys keep asking about its market cap at 1b Lol u say its over valued at 1b? What makes you say that, is it because their not generating any high revenue or their burning through cash. Yet, all other cannabis stocks are faced with the same issue and not to mention they are all piled with debt except SNDLIf youre basing your facts that its overvalued because of its revenue performance than you might as well say all cannabis stocks are overvalued because most if not all, are still burning through cash. And the top cannabis stocks you guys mention are Nowhere near a penny stock, which diminishes their entire purpose in this thread. The point of this post is to show a penny stock that can potentially boom due to being undervalued in comparison to others. Not trying to list the top leading cannabis stocks, which is what you guys keep mentioning.

- EDIT:regarding the comment about Canadian companies in the us market -Well for starter how do you know that once US goes through full legalization they wont accept Canadian companies to flourish. Theres already major Canadian companies expanding in the us, and you dont think SNDL is capable of doing an acquisition with a us company or let alone expanding their product/name to the us. Even if they partially succeed in expanding to the Us, they can still be major players in the Canadian cannabis industry youre talking about a growing 37mill population with 99% cannabis enthusiasts. SNDL has lots of potential to grow. Search up this article (sundial growers splashy deal-nasdaq)

Hope that answers some of your questions, I am no financial advisor DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. I cant provide you with all the info or predictions on whether this stock will rise or sink. I am quite bullish on this stock based on my reasons, but there are multiple sources online that can further elaborate on where this stock is heading. And hey at $1 a share Im willing to risk it for the biscuit.

Title: 8th grade research project: $NVDA
Swear to god if the automod removes this... 

Alright listen up retards. NVDA is going to print at earnings. 

#Retard Analysis
Over the last three quarters, Nvidia EPS growth averaged 81%. They have earnings on the 24th, probably going to do well. CHRISTMAS could have some helpful effect as more people get into PC gaming. Especially with the shortage of PS5 and Xbox X that could have pushed some over the edge to switch. Regardless it would be a minor, but still positive impact. 

#Expanding Business 
Looking at Q3 2020 reports we can see some great news in expanding their business. Saw revenue and sales up 57%, a new record for them. 

* "Launched the NVIDIA EGX Intelligent Edge Computing Platform to bring accelerated AI to retail, manufacturing, telecommunications, logistics and other industries, with Walmart, BMW, NTT East, Procter &amp; Gamble and Samsung Electronics among early adopters". 
 
* USPS is going to use their AI tech to improve packaging process. 

* Loads of updates to software and companies adding RTX support showing they are becoming a standard in the industry. 

* The push forward on AI with self driving that is surely to increase going forward long term. 

* Their data center division revenue passed their gaming division and we all know data is the gold mine *PRPL autist PTSD*. Data center sales increased 162%.

#Red Hat
But the item im most interested in is the Red Hat collab they are starting. They are trying to get more involved with 5G telecom market by making virtualized 5G RAN networks using their GPUs. Retardedly put, they want to simplify how current telecom traffic works and make it more harmonized: to bring down maintenance and management costs; increase flexibility; allow multiple vendors to work on the same hardware and share resources. Further, Red Hat is going to become a major player in the cloud services industry. Azure and AWS just don't have the same capabilities as Red Hat's open source infrastructure and having a good relationship with NVDA looks great for future projects.   

#Semiconductor shortage easing
The world is coming off the end of a semiconductor shortage that was showing some recovery before COVID. Likely there will be no shortage going further into this year, maybe even early as Q2. Many of the car manufactures have been feeling the effects of the semi conductor shortage, even having to shut down factories temporarily before the situation improves. Bodes well for NVDA, supply is constricted and the pent up demand will blow its metaphorical load heavily at NVDA and other semis. 

#Bear case
The only hiccup: ARM merger deal is running into problems from anti-trust complaints by competitors. Likely to not happen when China reviews it and says no. The merger would make ARM US based and have the same US restrictions on exporting tech to Huawei or other blacklisted companies. Same thing happened with Qualcomm and N_X_P (automod removing small cap tickers) semiconductors. But on the off chance it does go through from both 1) The US taking a different stance towards China and 2) NVDA convincing regulators that ARM would still have impartiality for how it does business, the upside is massive. Not too concerned with it not happening since NVDA will adapt and move on. Its more of a bonus to NVDA and would only add to their underlying business that is already doing very good.


#What the big money is doing

Increased from 150 hedges funds with NVDA in their top 10 holdings to 218 in Q3 2020.

3% increase in institutional ownership from Q2 to Q3 2020

https://imgur.com/a/eGmb4cy

They are mostly buying more and some are trimming their positions slightly. Big bois are cool with it so you can be confident that ThE hEdGe FuNdS wOnT bUrN yOu .


#TA for mentally ill
Has been largely stagnant since September, just now hitting new highs. Summarized crayons TA: Some major resistance at ~590 and just broke it and has been holding for the last 2 days. RSI is a little over bought, Id be guessing there is some sideways action for a couple days and then a run up and beat at earnings.

Title: You've heard of the Becky Portfolio. Welcome to the Chad Portfolio. Why Gaming is going to explode within the next 5 years.
We all know of the infamous Becky portfolio.  Our wives wake up in the morning, put on their $LULU's and head off to get their daily fix of $SBUX.  They scroll through $ETSY enjoying their coffee and while they are out they stop by Nordstrum ($JWN) and $ULTA so they can buy makeup so they look really nice for when they're riding their BF's cock.  We all know this is true, because these stocks kick ass.  They are some of the best performers of their time, because us guys simp our dicks off for women and shell out our hard earned tendies so we can hopefully have permission to jerk off during the weekly cuckoldry session.

But you know what else we simp our dicks off for?

Gaming, motherfucker.

Yeah, that's right.  The boys all game, and we all game together.  This shit is going to explode because there's nothing men spend more money on collectively outside of women and beer.  And until PornHub IPOs there isn't a better investment sitting in the market right now.  Let me paint you a picture:

You wake up Saturday morning after a long Wendy's shift the night before.  You have plenty of tendies sitting in your bank account from your last direct deposit and despite your Robinhood being -69% from your GME "investment" and the $600 you spent on hookers in the last week you've got enough money to buy yourself some vidya games.

But wait, you need something to play them on!  You've got some options here.  If you're a financially responsible peasant you're probably going to want to go with a Console like $MSFT Xbox or the $SNE Playstation.  You'll buy your games from $GME, $AMZN, or $BBY and you'll call it a day.

But you?  You're a rich motherfucker.  That stimmy check just hit and your peener is erect in all of its 3 inches of glory.  You're about to upgrade yourself to a gaming PC.  First off, your Gaming PC needs some parts.  Your $CRSR power supply, fans, and RAM look rather sharp.  Your $AMD processor is lightning fast and leaves $INTC chips in the dust.  And your latest generation graphics card from $NVDA can't be beat.  You'll also need some gaming gear too!  Good thing we have our old friend $CRSR and $LOGI to help us out here.

But what will you be playing?  The new Grand Theft Auto from $TTWO of course.  And maybe for the more morally bankrupt among us (sus) even $EA games.  And what powers these games?  Game engines.  Unity ($U) will be powering many of your favorite steam games.

So that's it.  You are ready to game with the boys.  But wait!  We have to throw $DKNG in as well.  Gaming with the boys wouldn't be the same without competing to see who can lose the most money over some bullshit.

Gaming is taking off my friends.  Keeping Gaming PC's up to date and the culture around gaming will become to men what the daily $SBUX fix is to women.  Men will begin treating PC gaming like we do cars.  We all strive to drive something nice and to take care of her.  You want to position yourself into the Chad portfolio now, because by the time the Wall Street Journal is talking about it it will already be too late.

So, do I have your vote of confidence boys?

Title: Which way?
Spineway!

Hello, i translate a DD i found in a german subreddit, I think its an interesting opportunity. it rose about 800% in the last two hours!

its from u/Sauer1993

"Hello everyone, I created my first DD yesterday ... unfortunately it was blocked because the share is not tradable on RH. That the efforts weren't in vain, I found this sub here and wanted to present the share to you. I look forward to your opinions Spineway (ALSPW) is a French company based in Lyon. The founding team consists of both doctors and engineers who have many years of experience in the field of spinal surgery. Spineway's excellent product portfolio includes a wide range of innovative systems for both open and minimally invasive access. The share was quoted at over  4 at the beginning of 2018, but fell steadily from then on due to poorer results and capital reductions due to the lowering of the nominal value of the share. Most recently in September 20 to counter a one-off financial burden in the form of compensation. Still, the company managed to increase operating profit by 18% in 2020. Sales in Asia also rose 71% in Q4 compared to 2019. A "renewal program" has been running since 2019 in order to reduce personnel costs and invest the available funds in R&amp;D. Spineway has also succeeded in gaining a certification partner to continue selling its products despite the future MDR accreditation. They are also currently researching new products that are intended to improve surgical techniques and generally reduce time and costs - keyword 3D printing. You are probably already in initial discussions with promising partners. All in all, I tell myself that the price is currently at  0.009 and it can't go much lower. I believe in the company and management that the savings and research will bear fruit in the next 1-2 years and that it has the potential to reach  1"

This is no professional advice, I don't have any knowledge about anything

Title: [TSLA] Pelosi leaps playbook
You may have all heard that Pelosi's husband bought [1m in tsla calls.](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/ptr-pdfs/2021/20018011.pdf) last month.

Maybe some of you are getting sick of chasing after GME and APHA wrecked your asses and wanna play some real stocks IDK.

I believe that bets are best placed BEFORE the stock is at ATH, so I think this is a good time to post this while TSLA is going through some dips.

There is a lot to talk about when it comes to everyone's favorite CEO, but I think the biggest headwinds are these:

1. EV credits are coming
2. FSD beta currently being used by 1000 lucky(?) Tesla drivers.
3. The House Majority Leader Pelosi bought leaps. 
4. *censored topic here*

I don't wanna make this really long, so I just want to go over what exactly she bought.

25 contracts [$500 strike expiring at March 18, 2022](https://imgur.com/Nlw4PWZ) 

Note that she's actually down about 30k on these as of today. Are you mad about politicians insider trading? Well holy fuck you have a chance to get in at LESS than what she paid.

This is what her payout looks like: https://imgur.com/blP7gLZ

Basically she can't lose any money unless TSLA closes below $940 in by March 2022. However, you will notice that the leverage applied is only 1~2x. Basically this is like baby leverage vs holding shares.

I wanted to entertain some alternatives. So what if you got bigger balls and say TSLA doubles from here at the minimum? https://imgur.com/ZZGDYUN

You can see the upside is so much higher but tsla has to move a lot fast to outrun the theta burn.

So what if you thought about theta and want to spread it instead? (A spread is when you buy a call then sell a call further otm.) https://imgur.com/HoPgNl1

You probably noticed here that payout distribution gets bigger as you get close to expiration. Personally I think this is a better play than ITM calls, but of course, if TSLA pulls another 5x from here, nothing beats the uncapped upside of plain calls.

At the end of the day however, if TSLA just goes down 10% from here and doesn't come back for a year, all of these are expiring worthless. Btw kind of fucking crazy that if you have 100 TSLA shares you can collect almost guaranteed 60% a year. 

Did you buy GME because you hate the establishment and their privileged trading free money? Well, they're doing this one in broad daylight. Would you take it? 

Also not financial advice. Gamble your chrome money at your own risk.

I like kitties but I am not into roaring.

I also check this site every day to see if any other [lawmakers are buying for additional confirmation.](https://senatestockwatcher.com/ticker.html?ticker=TSLA)

Title: $CLNE Super Bull Case
CLNE Clean Energy Corporation is a GIANT sleeping bull just starting to wake up in my opinion. (Not financial advice just my opinion) The stock is up over 500% in the past year and there are good reasons why. The market cap as of now is $3 billion so it still is relatively small and has a lot of room to run. I know some people might think its already up 500% where is the room to run... I get it but if PLUG can go from around $1 to $65 for gods sake CLNE can make a huge run too. CLNE revenue last quarter was $70.89 million up from the previous quarter of $59.87. They are not profitable yet but close to being profitable. The earnings per share last quarter was -0.01. Not bad. Previous quarters EPS was -0.02. Earnings is in March and it is expecting the earnings to be 0.01 per share. They have scored multiple contracts and recently a major one with L.A County Metro. For the LA County Metro they will be supplying 47.5 million gallons of renewable natural gas. Clean Energy Fuels scores a five-year contract to supply renewable natural gas for the nation's largest transit bus fleet. Also analysts are bullish on CLNE. Tuesday February 3rd Shares of Clean Energy Fuelssoared after the natural gas marketer and retailer received an initial rating of outperform with a price target of $17 from Credit Suisse. MarketBeat shows a consensus price target of $18.67. PLUG revenue was around $100 million last quarter and still not profitable. I think we will see profitability soon with CLNE. The Clean energy industry is just getting starting. I first bought in at around $12 and slowly added to original position. Lets see whats to come in the near future.

Title: VYGVF - good long term play? Heres my thoughts on a well performing coin broker with legs.
VYGVF has been severely overlooked. A coin brokerage out of Canada that offers a simple and clean purchasing/trading experience for a multitude of coincrypt currencies.

- Im not personally a fan of trading coins because I feel like individual coins are too volition for a long term play but I do recognize that the public appreciates the concept of a poor mans off shore account approach to sheltering earnings. 

- VYGVF It had very good gains over the last month in all the frenzy and where it has no ties to any one coin currency, it seems to benefit massively every time one becomes the new buzz. Thats a huge draw, as theres always some dude that makes a million on some obscure coin and one article drives a million schmucks to these platforms. 

-IMHO, this is an opportunity for huge long term gains as the world begins to show greater appreciation for decentralized currencies. Im not an advocate of options trading because its not in my window of risk tolerance but Ive been buying this stock on and off again since $1.30 and have never been disappointed. If I was to put a call on it I wouldnt hesitate to say 30-50$ by end of year. 

-Looking across multiple coin brokerages this one also have no trading fees which makes me feel like it could be the next RH of coin trading.

   Note(RH has a bad name right now with the GME stuff but anyone who thinks they didnt create a profitable machine is out of their mind)

Please share your thoughts as Im interested in other peoples perspectives.

Title: DD: Missed TSMC? My bull case for Shin-Etsu.
Intro: Over the past few months, there have been an increasing number of posts discussing the semiconductor shortage in the automotive industry. The TLDR for these posts is that the big winner here is going to be TSMC. TSMC is the leading chip foundry in the world. It produces chips for Intel, AMD, Apple, and many others. 

My thesis: The chip shortage is already priced into the current value of TSMC. I still have 9 shares of TSM, but I am going long on those. This is a shorter term play based off of the ongoing automotive semiconductor shortage. TSMC sources it's wafers from 5 suppliers, 4 of which are publicly traded. These companies are F.K.S., MEMC, S.E.H., Siltronic, SUMCO. These 5 companies produce 85% of the worlds raw wafers. Shin-Etsu produces 33% of the worlds wafers. Shin-Etsu is also positioning itself to be one of the primary producers of the chips that are invloved in the automotive industry shortage. In addition, Shin-Etsu is one of TSMC's primary suppliers of Photoresist. Finally, Shin-Etsu is based in Taiwan, TSMC is fully aware of this and is taking full advantage of the logistics advantages associated with Shin-Etsu's geographical position. 
TLDR: I think that SHECY is going to see a rapids spike in the next 6 months.

Title: $SONO DD
Alright autists, going to give you a real simple DD that everyone can understand.

Remember when $PTON was trading in the $20s? Let me remind you... There was this flashy exercise bike company that thought they would take the home gym market by storm. It was slow, but then the pandemic hit. There was a huge shift to home gyms and $PTON crushed earnings in May 2020. Their stock rocketed to $43 and the rest is history. 

I am happy to say that the $PTON rocket to $43 in May 2020 is where we are today with $SONO.

$SONO just reported earnings ($1.17 EPS) that beat estimates ($.88 EPS). Along with that, they raised their 2021 revenue ($1.6b) and earnings targets - 

[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sonos-easily-tops-revenue-estimates-as-pandemic-fuels-continued-boom-in-speaker-sales-11612991269?siteid=yhoof2](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sonos-easily-tops-revenue-estimates-as-pandemic-fuels-continued-boom-in-speaker-sales-11612991269?siteid=yhoof2)

But back to why this makes sense from a trend perspective. First off, $SONO has industry leading sound quality for home audio. I own it. It is amazing. The reason I bought it was, after a long search, they were the only true wireless surround sound (and full home audio) company out there. Their tech is very far ahead of their competitors and it shows with constant growth in revenue. 

But, the main trend... Warner Bros is releasing blockbusters to HBO Max the same day as theaters, Netflix subscriptions are up, Disney is releasing movies same day to Disney+, streaming services are popping up left and right... AMC and other theaters are HURTING and might not hold on. There is a massive shift to in-home theaters and $SONO dominates when it comes to in-home audio. 

In the future, they will partner with some fancy new EV company for in-car audio. They have plans to do that. 

Anyway, I see $SONO going to $70 by EOY. 

Positions - 

10 3/19 $40c

40 7/16 $45c

500 shares @ $36.06

TLDR - Buy $SONO. Trend to in-home theater and audio is just beginning to be noticed. Lagged the in-home gym trend, but is a bigger market. $SONO is the industry-leader in performance and only true full-home wireless audio company out there. In-car audio coming soon. $70 EOY PT. Writing on a computer so please spam rockets to make up for the lack of them up here.

Title: Cloudflare earnings OVERNIGHT PLAY (Good 'ol fashioned DD)
While most of you degenerates have been trying to time pump-and-dumps, there's been some serious gains going on in Cloudflare ($NET). They are up 30% over the last week. Cloudflare is a world-renowned cloud computing company that offers services from cyber-security to content-hosting. It IPO'd at the end of 2019, and is already up over 500% in the last 12 months. Cloud services are expanding at an extremely rapid rate, and it's one of the tech industries that has massively benefitted from Covid-19, considering the increase of online-time from.

Cloudflare Q4 earnings report is **tonight**. There has been some serious whale buy volume in anticipating the earnings jump \[[source](https://imgur.com/a/1jQnAYE)\]. Almost every stock with a heavy hand in cloud computing (esp Amazon, Google, Microsoft) have destroyed their Q4 earnings report. Cloudflare is the biggest CDN provider, and one of, if not the, biggest DDOS and bot protection provider. They have a massive hand in the market and serve millions of businesses, from small to ultra-large corporations. \[[source](https://enlyft.com/tech/products/cloudflare)\]

They have outperformed their anticipated earnings, and last report drew over any 11% uptick after the Q3 earnings statement. A solid earnings report tonight could draw an extremely strong uptick in price, and I'm betting on it. Positions: 2/12 $89 c, 2/12 $90, 6/16 c$110 

TLDR: This literally can't go tits up, overnight calls are a one way ticket all the way to tendietown. 

This is not real financial advice, I eat crayons, do your own DD to decide whether you want to buy a stock.

Title: Tilray ($TLRY) seems to be a good hold for at least one mentally challenged trader).
This is my first DD. Please be gentle. I promise I'll keep it short, sweet, and retarded.

Tilray ($TLRY) seems like a solid play. It is merging with Aphria with the Aphria CEO taking charge. After the merger, the combined company will hold the largest market share of cannabis production in Canada.

Senate Majority Leader, Chuck Schumer (D-New York), is pushing for Federal decriminalization in the near future (how near is hard to tell but hopefully they will at least begin the process this year). This will, of course, create a boom in marijuana demand as the "normies" who fear legal prosecution but also want some of that kind, kind bud will come out screaming "Take my money!" like Fry.
Just look at what happened in Colorado.

While this bodes well for all Cannabis producers, I think Tilray is particularly attractive because it is vulnerable to a short squeeze. It was already squoze once in 2018 and its shares broke $300+. Then it only carried short interest in the mid 50%+ range. Today it is in the mid 80%'s. 

Unlike some other stocks that are popular around here, I feel this one actually has some fundamentals to support a bullish position on it.

One caveat: Federal decriminalization don't mean shit at the state level. Individual states can still keep it illegal if they want. Perhaps with popular support behind the federal initiative, that too will fall away.

Tilray did well this week then took a shit so now might be a good time to buy in on the cheap. I really don't see this stock doing anything but going up long term. But that said it will be volatile as hell on the way up so obligatory.  .

Also, obligatory: I'm not a hedge fund shill. I'm not a new account. This is my porn account I've had for years. I just use it for other types of porn now (mainly loss porn).

Final obligatory: This is not financial advice. I am truly and deeply retarded as shown by my flawed DD above.

Title: BETTING ON REHABILITATION CENTERS!
I am seeing people pushing around sectors closely related to most talked about stocks. 
With weed to the next addiction being pushed around here is psychedelics. Not saying that it's legit or a shill. I ain't that smart.
I think it's better to start the investing into rehabilitation centers making a double jump over hedge funds and Buffets.

Now if when these things get legalized, read as easier access, and people make money from drugs stocks( inserting squeeze cause this seems to catch the attention) people will start abusing drugs more n more. Here are some unthoughtful and un-researched points below to back my weak idea poorly. 

Positive points:
1. Here is a generic positive point. People will need to get in after over consumption of weed and/or psych.
2. People find it useful(11/10 approve). Some made up stat for the retards.
3. Some news blog cited this post about rehab. Let me also post that link with bots other sister subs to gain trust.

Negative points:
None. Nada. They don't exist if I don't talk about them 

Finally: tldr
 Rockets for the retards cause this seals the deal. Also it can go to the moon or the bottom of the Atlantic. God speed. 

If you still didn't get it, this is not a financial advice but once in a lifetime opportunity.

Title: PANDEMIC PLAY!
So Ive been watching $CLX for some time now.. and Iv finally entered a position yesterday. 
Were still in the middle of this whole COVID thing and Lysol and other cleaning products have been going FAST at local super markets. $CLX is currently at a 10 month low for whatever reason after beating earnings.. Its low volume and low IV. 
I personally went in on some 4/16 220C that are currently trading for .80! If this thing returns back to 210-220 range, those calls will easily quadruple. Clorox had a 52 week high at almost $240!

Heres a statement from the recent earnings call! 

It was said:

On an organic basis, Q2 sales grew 26%. I will now go through our results by segment. In our Health and Wellness segment, Q2 sales were up 42%, reflecting double digits increases in 2 of 3 businesses. Our Cleaning business had double-digit sales growth behind strong ongoing demand across our portfolio. Consumption remains high and, importantly, we're continuing to see increases in household penetration and repeat rates among existing and new users, driven by new routines developed from the prolonged pandemic as well as strategic brand investments.

I think it has a lot of upside potential!

TLDR; $CLX 4/16 220c

Title: Betting WKHS on the USPS Contract? Hedge with Microvast/THC
THC is a spac company which recently signed a definitive agreement with [Microvast](http://microvast.com/). Microvast is already an established battery company (100m revenue, 1.5bil in contracts through 2027) with a 20min charging batt and most of their clients are larger vehicles, i.e. buses, vans. You may have seen it jump 70% to 25 just to pull back to about 20 over the last 2 weeks.

**Oshkosh**

Oshkosh recently entered a "strategic development" with Microvast, and just the other day the news broke that Microvast is building a factory in Tennessee (read: US-based). Oshkosh (OSK) also invested 25m into Microvast in this move. This new Tennessee factory represents their third one, but importantly their first in the US. The other two are in china and Germany.

**USPS Contract**

So recently there has been talk about the USPS contract, and whether garbage-on-wheels WKHS will get it. obviously this would represent an upwards rocket for WKHS so maybe an options play is worth it , idk I'm no greeks savant.

Folks here have made the point that WKHS is the only fully electric EV-maker in the ring still, and therefore they have the upper hand to win the contract. Meanwhile OSK submitted a contract which included some gas vehicles. (it is worth noting that the USPS contract does not ask for 100% electric, allowing for some gas) But seeing as WKHS is not really at scale (at all), and the democrats whole identity is saying the exciting thing (EV USPS Fleet) and doing another less exciting (some gas some electric) and Oshkosh is an established player in government contracts, I think they have the upper hand. But Oshkosh is already work 6b, is splitting the contract with Ford, and is still a govt manufacturer. The upside here is limited.

**Manufacturing**

This is a big point that I haven't seen adequately addressed. The OSK competitors simply don't have the infrastructure set up to produce the number of trucks needed to supply the USPS.

WKHS - Owns 10% of a factory in Lordstown

Karsan - partners with Michigan factory but is only an electric engine, not full truck. USPS needs new vehicles as the old ones are prone to breakdown/fires.

Oshkosh/Ford - Duh massive US manufacturing capacity.

**Microvast as the Growth Play**

Microvast is clearly positioning themselves to benefit from the US vehicle electrification age. The battery shortage is just beginning and Microvast is set to land some big contracts either way. But OSK winning the USPS contract and contracting Microvast for some of the battery tech would give the company a new shine. It is worth mentioning that the company has trash PR. just look at their website. If this happens I'm expecting THC to break 30.

**Quick Technicals**

No funky lines but this is a SPAC. It trades on news and deadlines. The definitive agreement pumped it up and now its bleeding until either merger or good Microvast news. With a small float, this stock will rocket on this news, and probably won't sink below 17 without it.

The stock also just got options, which could play into a nice run.

**Positions**

I'm jacked to the tits with 750 commons, 2k warrants. This play represents over half my portfolio lol.

**P.S.**

This thing just has my spidey (read: Dem hater) senses tingling. Its the exact type of deal that the govt likes to make, satisfies all the PR necessities etc. How much THC/Microvast stands to gain from this deal is unclear, but OSK winning the contract is obvious imo.

Title: Some (RAD) Rite Aid DD and Updates
Hello WSB back with an update on my Rite Aid play.  Up 50% from when I entered my positions yesterday and held through the dip early.  I think we will continue to see upward movement through the end of the month after the earlier movement this week.  

I am posting this again today as people thought it may be too late yesterday, but today is a great time to get in.


**RITE AID (RAD)**

Okay I know, your app is showing you it was .50 a year ago and youre saying fuck idk about this one, it looks like I missed it.  Its okay though, robbingyouhood is just lying again.  The truth is that rite aid had a 1:20 **reverse stock split** artificially X 20 the price.

*WHAT DOES THIS MEAN*

It means we can assume two things, rite aid has only doubled in price since its mediocre deal with Walgreens fell through.  

In 2016 Rite Aid had 4561 stores with a stock price of 160~ (adjusted for split) and a market cap of 8 billion dollars.  

In 2020 Rite Aid has 2500 stores with a stock price of 25~ and a market cap of 1.5 billion.

Yet if we look here https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/RAD/rite-aid/revenue

Rite aid revenue has actually INCREASED over the past five years and is at 75% of its highest point.  


They have trimmed the fat and beat earnings the last three quarters.


MORE PROMISING NUMBERS

https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/RAD/financials/annual/balance-sheet

Rite aid has a pretty optimistic balance sheet for a company that has been rebranding and restructuring.  Notably we can see they are sitting on 6 Billion in assets and are seeing 21 Billion Revenue with 12% growth this past quarter (over 25% this year)

Rite aid is becoming closer and closer to becoming consistently profitable once again as they are able to take advantage of coronavirus tax relief.  They are seeing increased foot traffic in their pharmacy and front end leading to this huge growth.  

Walgreens has 30x the market cap and 4x the revenue while CVS has 70x the market cap and 10x the revenue.  Neither are seeing the growth that rite aid is.  


**WHAT DO I DO**

I am very bullish on rite aid.  I am still holding shares and have adjusted my calls to 3-19 $30 and 4-16 $35 a handful of 2022 40$ as well.  

I have a price target or 50$ which I think is attainable by April. 

**UPDATED INFO**

The biggest criticism I see of rite aid are its debt and the fact it is a drug store.  

As for the debt, I believe this is already priced in.  Even with the 3.5 billion in debt Rite aid is STILL UNDERVALUED BY A BILLION DOLLARS. 

As for rite aid being a drug store, they have recently partnered not only with HEB grocery but they also launched their telehealth to generate additional revenue. 


Tl;DR: Rite aid was shorted to shit and saved itself with a 1:20 reverse split.  As a result its STILL fundamentally undervalued.  

4-16 35$ C
3-19 30$ C

Title: Why I think $SNDL has massive POTential
420 POT STOCK 420 

 SQUEEZE POTENTIAL  



Sundial Growers produces high quality cannabis products in their individual controlled modular grow rooms at a 470,000 sq ft state-of-the-art Health Canada licensed facility in Olds, AB, eh. With a large portfolio of brands, they have products at every price point from low to high-end, flower to topicals and a crap ton of money.

In the beginning of February, they announced the completion of a $0.75 public offering for a cool $100 milly. Simultaneously, they launched another offering. BuT tHaT's GoInG tO DiLuTe tHe MaRkEt! ThE sToCk HaS A 1 BiLlIoN dOlLaR fLoAt. Doesnt that fucking suck? No, it doesnt, and Ill tell you why: its good. 

These offerings allowed these guys to load up on mad cash and sky's the limit with this new found cash money 420 swag 69. They are sitting on something like $600+ milly. That is a lot of fucking money. So what are they going to spend it on? Acquisitions? Expansion? Whatever it is, I trust the fuck out of their management team. "Sundial's current balance sheet and liquidity enable management to focus on delighting consumers while providing significant optionality to participate in North American consolidation," said Sundial's CEO, Zach George. Fuck yea George, delight me.

more rockets

We saw some crazy movement last night and premarket this morning, potentially shorts covering some naked calls, as we saw a lot of call action at $1.50, $2, $2.50, and $3 this week. Then, we opened and saw some major sell-off. Thats fine, because we got to see how this reacted to this once volume leveled out. Good news, were chilling above $3 with some nice bounces off $3.10. Now, were also seeing people go full HAM on $5 2/19 calls. 

You know what else excites me about this banger? When I go to purchase this stock in Fidelity, do you know what happens? MESSAGE DW34-FUCKING-02: *The price of this security has been highly volatile. Consider the potential risk of loss and closely monitor any purchase you make.* Uhh, can you say BONER JAMZ 2021? 



$SNDL TO THE MOON BABY 

But dont take my word for it. Seriously, dont. Im not a financial expert and this is not advice, merely my meaningless pea brained opinion. Do your own research and shit. Or dont, Im not your fucking dad.

Title: $HPTY - Hemp Technologies Strong Growth Potential
Hemp Tech is a penny stock whos CEO built the Canary brand which is a leading packaging and marketing company for cannabis products. 

The company is focused on the hemp market and building a portfolio of companies in the hemp industry. As weed approaches legalization, hemp and hemp based products will grow in supply and begin filling demand met by other commodities today. It looks like it has long term growth potential and experienced leadership to lead that growth. 

At $2.48m market cap, $0.004 share price and a $0.006 52 week high, its a low barrier to entry for a company positioned to capitalize on legalization.

https://www.hemptechnologyinc.com/management/

In September of last year they acquired the assets of True Leaf Pet Inc. ("TLP") which is now being operated as a wholly owned subsidiary under the name Hemp Tech, Pet Health Technology Inc and added 20,000 stores to Hemp Technologies distribution network.

Title: $RKT DD TO THE MOOOOONNNNN
This is my first DD post on any company, be gentle.

Disclaimer: I am long RKT. This is not financial advice, and I am not receiving any compensation whatsoever from anyone for this post. Im not a professional, Im not even an amateur, this is a Wendys.

Sources used: RKT investor relations website and company website, RKT earnings transcripts, SEC fillings, the SEC EDGAR database, sea king al pha, whalewisdom, finbox, yahoo finance, stockcharts, openinsider, Zacks, google sheets.



Summary

Rocket Companies (RKT) is a fintech company that operates several brands including the flagship Rocket Mortgage. I think RKT presents an opportunity to buy serious value at a cheap price, because the market has not priced in the underlying fact that RKT is a tech company akin to Square, Paypal, etc.

RKT has disrupted the lending industry and has embraced a fully digital ecosystem, which will continue to drive customer acquisition and retention in the future
RKT spends considerable money and resources on UX/UI development, client experience, and marketing. This will also help drive their continued expansion into the lending market.
The RKT ecosystem provides a full cycle solution for everything related to real estate transactions and insurance. They serve real estate professionals looking to generate leads, develop those leads, better serve their clients, and make every stage of real estate transactions smoother. From the client side, they similarly just make everything easier - its an app, its online, its doable from home and its not complicated. Theres an inherent advantage in what theyre doing here because closing on real estate transactions has always been something thats complex, unpleasant, expensive, and not well understood. You need lawyers, you need agents, theres a ton of paperwork, it sucks. RKT is changing all of that.
RKTs balance sheet, income, and liabilities support a stock price several times higher than the current one in my opinion.
RKT is currently stagnant in price, and the market appears to be pricing it like a traditional mortgage company, not a rapidly growing tech company (which they are).
RKT has been around for decades (skips the startup costs that will provide barrier to entry for newer companies looking to do what theyre doing), but somehow seems to still be leading the tech charge in the industry. Thats a unique and potent combination in my opinion.
RKT needs a catalyst to get the market to value it as a tech company instead of a lending company. Once that happens, and I expect it to sometime within the next year, RKT should approach an appropriate valuation such as 20x earnings. Thats an estimate I pulled out of nowhere, but is commensurate with the low end of P/E ratios for companies I see as similar to RKT.
Key Point - RKT is Priced Like a Legacy Mortgage Company

The average estimate for 2020 year end revenue is $15 billion, and the yearly earnings estimate average is $3.85 per share.

This estimate gives a ttm P/E ratio of just over 5.5. The sector median is something like 8-12, which makes RKT cheaply valued relative to the earnings it produces, even compared to the financial/mortgage sector. Whats key here is, I dont think thats really an appropriate comparison. I would place them more in line with companies like Square (ttm P/E ratio of 325x lol), PayPal (ttm P/E ratio of 69x, nice), or Fiserv (ttm P/E ratio of 24x). I used Zacks for all of these P/E ratio lookups.

Lets assume RKT is conservatively worth 15x earnings, and that it hits the estimate of $3.85 eps. That would put its fair value right now at $57.75 per share. I think its worth more than that but, we all should do well to remember that its really only worth whatever the market will pay for it.

Key Point - Catalysts

This thing needs a catalyst. Right now I am loading up. Im buying shares, Im selling SHORT TERM covered calls to reduce basis on those shares, but I will be stopping the sale of those covered calls within a couple weeks most likely. The Q4 earnings announcement will be on 2/25. I am not sure that the actual earnings numbers will be enough to wake this thing up, although I expect them to be good. But if that announcement comes with discussion of their focus for 2021 and beyond, and gets the market thinking about them as a tech company first and mortgage lending company second, things will start to heat up. I dont know when the real catalyst will hit that triggers the run-up, but I think it could start with the Q4 earnings call. I am looking at $21 as the floor for this stock, and I expect the price to double within a year. I will be acquiring OTM LEAPs, expiring next spring.

Supporting information and background follows.

The Business

RKT is in the business of providing solutions to financial transactions, including mortgage origination and refinancing, auto lending, and more. Specific subsidiaries and my simplistic view of how they interact:

Home Financing

Rocket Mortgage - The mortgage company. This is a prominent public facing part of the Rocket ecosystem.
Amrock - Amrock provides title insurance, property valuations, and other solutions. I see this as supporting infrastructure to keep clients within the rocket ecosystem where they would otherwise need to go elsewhere and is part of what makes RKT a one-stop-shop.
Amrock Title Insurance (ATI) Company - basically does underwriting for Amrock. The business end in my simple understanding of the world.
Nexsys - provides a streamlined approach to the closing process with their Clear Sign and Clear HOI technologies - taking care of closing day authentications and sharing of homeowners insurance information.
Lendesk - Lendesk specifically provides solutions for the mortgage market in Canada
Edison Financial - Basically the front end of Lendesk that Canadian clients would interact with.
Home Sale and Search

Rocket Homes - Rocket Homes is a proprietary home search platform and real estate agent referral network. Basically this matches buyers, sellers, and agents, and is a key aspect of keeping clients completely working within RKT for all aspects of real estate buying/selling/financing.
For Sale By Owner - A digital marketplace designed to let clients buy and sell real estate on their own. I think its absolutely brilliant that RKT owns this, but more on that later.
Auto &amp; Personal Financing

Rocket Auto - Supports rental and online car purchasing platforms.
Rocket Loans - online personal loan solutions for clients.
Media

Core Digital Media - a major advertiser in the mortgage, financial, insurance, and education sectors.
Lower My Bills - this company is basically a portal business model that connects people with providers of various loan and insurance products.
Services &amp; Technology Development

Rock Connections - Basically a sales and support platform that handles appointments, prequalifications, generating leads, and data analysis among other things.
Rock Central - I will generalize this as business support. HR, administration, etc.
Rocket Innovation Studio - A tech incubator to gather and engage top talent and ideas.
Recent Acquisitions

RKT, through Lendesk, acquired Finmo back in October of 2020 (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-subsidiary-acquires-fast-182042594.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALnvnNBoglSnmMP0O61AqgXBJokNS53LjJYuG3NvYKhayp4I6ZH2RpfmFUbSsCAU4xmnBNGMTwiEG-Ly29EabVy1-OjPIGfkYoQ3389gn3Edebs9sIwWOy1tPzqjRwOwwGA_PWg0cNzEFCe7HBTilMwADUT_y0QxWw8vizWecGcv) Finmo is a rapidly growing Canadian digital mortgage platform and this acquisition I think was perfect - it shows RKTs dedication to embracing a fully digital experience, and making sure theyre the ones leading that charge.

Management

I do not have much to say here, aside from this. The RKT team is not the new kids on the block, they have decades of industry experience. Also, I value leaders that make people feel valued. And on that note, under CEO Jay Farner Quicken Loans has been in the top 30 of Fortunes 100 Best Companies to Work For list for 17 consecutive years.

Financials and Growth

When it comes to the numbers, RKT is killing it. I dont want to just spout a bunch of numbers that anyone can easily go look up so heres a couple that stood out to me from the Q3 earnings announcement and related data:

$4.63 billion in revenue, which is 163% YoY growth.

From that revenue, they beat EPS estimates with $1.21 for the quarter vs $1.09 expected.

Net income was $2.4 billion which represents a YoY growth of 365%.

Closed loan volume YoY growth was 122% to $89B.

Net rate lock volume was $94.7 Billion (101% growth).

RKT has brought in $13.1 billion in revenue in the first 3 quarters and seems to be on track to close out Q4 with yearly revs above $15 billion.

Thats awesome but what I really like is that they pair this amazing growth with $3.5B cash on hand. Thats great because I want them to be able to scale as they grow, and make acquisitions as needed (see Finmo) to ensure they can keep that growth going without getting overextended and failing to capitalize.

RKTs ability to recapture clients is one of the keys to their future success in my uneducated opinion. Their recapture rate is 4.6x the industry average. The Q3 earnings transcript includes a statement by the CEO on how when interest rates fall, retention rate falls, refinance activity is larger. The high recapture rate RKT has serves as a natural hedge to their retention of existing clients because their recapture is so much higher than average in the industry.

Quick aside - RKT announced a $1 billion share buyback program. Theyll be able to repurchase shares from time to time starting Nov10 2020, ending in two years. I dont love the idea of share buybacks because I think this can be detrimental to actual business growth for the sake of shareholder value. However, with the large cash position RKT has (and it doubled from December 2019 to September 2020) I think this is a reasonable way to deploy some of that cash for now.

Ok so what about valuation using DCF, free cash flow analysis, something like that? Honestly Im not convinced this is as useful as some people make it out to be. Its nice to know what the numbers indicate, but I dont spend a lot of time worrying about an exact price target based on anything like this. That said, you can crunch the numbers yourself or check out something like the Finbox resources:

https://finbox.com/NYSE:RKT/models/dcf-growth-exit-5yr

I dont believe that fair value estimate for an instant, but it's a part of the puzzle to consider. Finbox has various models you can check out, but its also just a nice place to view aggregate data other than directly from the SEC filings.

Product Channels

RKTs direct-to-consumer channel is their main source of revenue right now, but I think they will be successful in their efforts to grow their partner channels as well. Why do I say that? Numbers dont lie:

Direct-to-consumer Q3 growth: 131% YoY ($53.5B closed loan volume)
Partner Network growth 127% YoY ($29.6B closed volume)
Adjusted Revenue for Partner Network is up 502% YTD vs 2019 ( see Q3 earnings transcript)
The partner network volume is a little over half of the direct-to-consumer volume but the growth rate is just so damn juicy. That revenue growth is hellathicc.

Current Market and outlook

Right now, rates are low. The average 30-yr mortgage fixed rate is 2.92% (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/mortgage-refinancing-surges-but-high-home-prices-stop-buyers.html)

I cannot say how long interest rates will remain low but I believe RKT is positioned to continue to grow regardless of what rates do moving forward. They just cover so much of the space, and they do it with a focus on applied technology.

Heres some blatant speculation. I think as we move into 2021 and the vaccine becomes more prevalent, millennials will buy, sell, and borrow against real estate with renewed intensity. I think RKT is uniquely positioned to capture that market.

Positions: RKT shares. Cost basis of $21.14.

Title: Why $MOR is a high IQ play in 2021. BioTech, Cancer, Inflammatory Diseases. DD Inside. 
**Disclaimer: This is not financial advice.**

**General:** 

During a pandemic both government spending and private investing lead to an increase in market value among the health and research sector. There are a lot of companies in those sectors that are worth investing in, but upon closer inspection, theres a subcategory that looks even more promising: Biotech. This branch combines both health and research. You might have heard the names of the most well-known representatives like Biontech and Pfizer. Both are playing an important role in the distribution of vaccines. But even seen independently of the current pandemic, Biotech will probably gain an indispensable status with regard to yet incurable diseases like cancer, autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. 

**Introducing MorphoSys:**

Market Cap: 3.759B

MorphoSys is an important developer of biopharmaceutical drugs. The company focuses on cancer as well as inflammatory diseases. However, the company focuses not only on pharmaceutical research itself, but also on the development of intelligent solutions and infrastructure, a major advantage compared to f. e. Biontech, where the lack of those lead to a lot of critique and problems, in regards to the distribution of the vaccine. MorphoSys already has two approved products on the market and three proprietary antibodies. The company is broadly positioned with their technology platforms in the market and also licenses them out to academic institutions and biopharmaceutical companies for research. Therefore MorphoSys is a multi-talented company that is both a software and a research company. In addition, MorphoSys already has approved compounds that provide the company with a financial cushion.

**The numbers:**

MorphoSys was able to show revenues of EUR 48.2M in the first half of 2019. However, this multiplied to EUR 269.7M in the first half of 2020. (These figures are in euros, as I took them from MorphoSys's German balance sheets). Losses turned from EUR -28.5M in the first half of 2019 to profits of EUR 179.8M in the first half of 2020.

**Conclusion:**

MorphoSys is a heavily undervalued company right now. The approaches the company is taking are similar to those of its chinese counterpart Wuxi Biologics. MorphoSys owns software that combines research and development while contracting it out to others. In doing so, the company is one of very few others that is working on autoimmune/inflammatory diseases in addition to cancer, effectively covering a gap in the market and creating a unique selling point.

**TL;DR:** German-American biotech company goes stonks 

Title: HAVN Life Sciences - Former APHA CEO and CSO in leadership roles
Being lazy as fuck, the first thing I look for in quality DD is leadership. (Ryan Cohen GME, Peter Thiel CMPS, Musk TSLA) When big names jump in, I'll have what their havning. 

HAVN's Executive Chair, Vic Neufeld, was CEO at Aphria for 5 years. Their Chief Scientific Officer was also the CSO at Aphria for 5 years.

MOST IMPORTANTLY one of their many advisors, Dr. David Mokler:

"*Dr. Mokler is also a Research Associate Professor at the Center for Behavioral Development and Mental Retardation in the Department of Psychiatry at the Boston University School of Medicine.*"

**Havn** Life has secured a Health Canada exemption, which allows for the research and development of psychedelic compounds. The exemption allows the Company to conduct this research prior to securing Licensed Dealer status.

The Licensed Dealer status will be secured by 2021 and will permit the supply and sale of regulated compounds.

Upon approval of the Companys Licensed Dealer application, the Companys subsidiary, Havn Labs, will be a preferred psychedelic supply partner for future clinical trials launched by HealthTech Connexs Centre for Neurology Studies.

HAVN is currently weighted 3.43% on the PSYK psychedelic index. 

&amp;#x200B;

RISKS:

Relatively new company, a lot of pending approvals and a lot of hopeful statements. Currently doesn't have a lot to show. They haven't released an earnings report. Always do your own DD, I am not a financial advisor.

Title: Tilray/Aphria, Medical Cannabis not Blaze 420 !!!
Retards, lots of post talking about why these two are a bad play for the USA coming into recreational legalization and most of them are actually correct, they are just being to retarded to consider a different point of view IMHO. This is not Blaze 420, it's about Medical Cannabis.

So first i dont think Biden will legalize recreational federally, so personally i'm not playing the recreational game at all (and recreational consumers want something that is hard to produce at scale). The medical game is where the money will be made on the short term, let me tell you why.

Biden will likely decriminalize cannabis (no more jail for you USA retards for the plant), legalize medical federally and leave it to the states if they want legal recreational or not. And this as nothing to due with Tilray and Aphria, and not the reason they are spinking, while everyone and their mother was sleeping they dominated the European medical market that is bigger than the USA medical market and will be in a prime position to enter the USA medical market when that opens, being compliant with GMP manufacturing already (this is kind of a big deal). 

   
 

And you retards don't think of the kids with epilepsie because they don't make you tendies. Comes Dr [Ethan B. Russo](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Russo%20EB%5BAuthor%5D&amp;cauthor=true&amp;cauthor_uid=28861491) and Dr [Cathy Davies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Davies%20C%5BAuthor%5D&amp;cauthor=true&amp;cauthor_uid=31741731) with the mother fucker endocannabinoid deficiency, PMID: [28861491](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28861491) and cannabinoids as a likely treatment to psychosis ( WTF?? LOL) PMID: [31741731](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31741731), maybe they can fixe retardation and this sub will finally find it's cure.

Mental health drug market is around 80B / year and the pandora box is stating to open

Pathologies already know to be related to endocannabinoids deficiencies around 50B/year

And while you apes that are still looking at your gme shares and thinking how the edge funds didn't used lube to fuck you in the ass with blatant market manipulation while your wife was getting racked by her boyfriend. Big players started opening positions in the, now about to explode medical cannabis field. This is a Pharma play you retards. And cannabinoid targeted medicines will be the fucking penicillin of this century only 100x better for tendies because it leads to lifelong medication unlike stupid penicillin where you only take it 5-14 days.

   
 

Thats why TLRY and Alphia are leading this market run, the deals they made with france and UK basically gave them the European market on a silver plate. And on top of that they are getting cheap, higly qualified workers in Spain Portugal and Greece + perfect weather to grow cannabis cheaply to extract compounds to be used in medicines.

   
 

Changes on the medical field come so fucking slowly tho, and will be a few years until cannabinoids treatments get stablish withing the medical field. Don't believe me? Look up the discovery of Helicobacter pylori by Barry Marshall and Robin Warren and how long it took to be accepted in the medical community. Same thing is ongoing with cannabis, cannabinoids and endocannabinoid system.

Title: $SUBZ - Streaming ETF that will PRINT
Alright retards, time to give you a play that you cant really go wrong in. I present you $SUBZ, a steaming sector ETF that started trading yesterday managed by Roundhill Investments.

Who is Roundhill investments? The same company that made the ETF $BETZ for all gambling stocks which has gone up 100% since it started trading and has been massively successful. 

$SUBZ will be your opportunity to have a piece of Netflix, Disney, Spotify, FuboTv and more. Theyre also investing in international markets that have streaming services which increases exposure. 

From Seeking a Alpha article:
One additional note is that this ETF will provide investors with a piece of global exposure as well. The streaming space is growing across the world as technology progresses. So, SUBZ holdings come from multiple countries. The United States represents 54.5% of the fund, China 26.9%, Sweden 5.8%, Japan 5.1%, South Korea 4.7% and Canada at 3%.

Lastly, you may ask what are the holdings:
https://www.roundhillinvestments.com/8d7c0ac3-bf60-423a-80a3-5688ddae31fb

I know you will all ask where are the options? Well, it just started trading yesterday so I am sure its around the corner but I highly suggest everyone take a piece of the pie.

*I am not a financial advisor, just an ape that wants to make tendies and help my friends. 

Good luck!

Title: Cheap mining stock with large upside potential: GWMO
**Great Western Mining Corp**

Ticker: **GWMO**

Current price: **0.24**

Cash flows will come from re-processing spoil heaps from a cluster of historic gold mines on Great Westerns Mineral Jackpot area, untouched since cessation of mining in 1940s.

Because of the mountainous terrain, there are large tracts of land under licence to the company that are unexplored that could be appraised using modern techniques.

preliminary drilling and surveying has found a large quantity of precious metal in old vein . Permission for a drilling rig has been granted and construction will begin around easter time.

**Main management**

Brian Hall- over 40 years experience managing natural resource companies 

Robert OConnell- 20 years very experienced commodities driller

Max Williams- 27 years managing financial account of publicly-traded natural resources companies

The area they are permitted to drill also has large quantities of silver and copper which they will also mine.

A speculative and early stage company, extremely cheap but could have a very large upside.

Title: OGI WILL HIT MARS SOON!
My DD as posted elsewhere because OGI was not allowed to be posted until now.

I think it still has plenty of room to run (I mean, look at Tilray, $70)

So, I don't think I need to explain the fact that because of current officials in office, it's very likely that legalization is a possibility in the near future.

When that does happen, all the weed stocks will rocket, but choosing one that is solid long term will be the best bet.

Now, I made a video on the current front runners, and choosing some of the best, but the way I see it, it's

Canopy

Tilray &amp; Aphria --&gt; Just merged, powerhouse

OGI

For the best long term potential and growth.
OGI is the only one in "penny stock" territory, sitting at about $2. If legalization does happen, I see this turning into a $30 stock short term and $50-60 long term. Which puts significant growth on the list, as the other two are inherently "pricier" (we know how market cap works don't worry.)

A simple look at short sellers (lower), balance sheets, and EPS put these 3 as prime candidates for the near future. OGI is already making pretty solid moves and growth, and thus we can see high potential for profit soon.

One of the important things about OGI and the other 2 brands I mentioned: they offer adult recreational use AND pharmaceutical products. This is big because YESTERDAY the FIRST cannabis based drug received REGULATORY approval in the US. This is big, because these companies already have the drugs set up - it could be a big advantage and head start.

In addition, the day before, they will begin with a new [Vice President of Operations.] This new VP comes from some of Canada's largest energy companies and should have a strong impact on improving efficiency. [This may be the new plant manager, needs confirmation]

In my video, I go over the websites for these stocks and I can send it to you if you are interested via PM (not looking to promote but can be part of DD) otherwise I encourage you guys to look at them yourselves.

An additional advantage is OGI is growing their facilities, and while I don't believe they are larger than the higher priced competitors, this will regardless give them an edge over US competitors because the infrastructure is already there. This way, contracts can be set up quickly upon legalization, setting back US companies (at least in the beginning).

As per investor relations:

Q1 2021 Canadian adult-use recreational gross and net revenue grew 42% and 30%, respectively, to $22.5 million and $16.8 million, respectively, from Q1 2020

Q1 2021 Canadian adult-use recreational gross and net revenue grew sequentially 14% and 11%, respectively, from Q4 2020

Generated positive cash flow from operations of $0.3 million in Q1 2021, representing the second quarter of the last three quarters with positive cash flow from operations 
Input &gt; while this doesn't seem like much, one thing to consider is that several of the weed companies are in the red, so this is actually a very good sign.

Ended the quarter with $134 million1 in cash and short-term investments; on December 1, 2020, made a $55 million repayment on term loan, resulting in pro-forma cash and short-term investments of $79 million1 with $60 million owing on its term loan

Subsequent to quarter-end, began increasing production and using additional existing capacity to meet increased consumer demand and capture more sales opportunities and economies of scale in the future


Please add to the discussion with your input, I'd love to hear it.

Rockets!

Title: Alright Apes. I got a good one for you. Listen up. SENS
SENS. Senseonics. 

Their product is better than everything on the market and extremely price competitive. they have a 90 say sensor implant for diabetes patients out now. Their competitors only have a 15 day sensor and costs like 3 times as much. health insurance covers the eversense sensor by senseonics. they have a 180 day sensor about to be approved by the fda and a 360 day sensor both of which are available in europe right now. Their competitors dexcom has a 38 billion market cap and right now SENS has a 1 billion market cap. SENS is currently trading at $3.80 and will hit $10 soon. It could easily 10x in the next year and take over the market. SENS to the moon     together!

Here is some more DD from u/whodisdani 

Alright guys, sorry for the late reply I gave my very best as I do this one of the first times ... maybe I am approaching this wrongly or interpreting this wrongly.

reporting back from my research: first of all I am not an accountant / economics student (I am an software engineering student who had a little bit of accounting, gave my very best to analyse the stuff) maybe if someone could double check (will link the infos and datasources):

the company made -94 millions in the last year, hence quite a bit away of being break even. In 2020 in comparison to their previous years their revenue operating revenue fell over 50%. This seems to be a covid related issue. In the last two quarters of 2020 they had some income, however, still far from profitable.



I tried to break this down into this new 180 day device thing you mentioned, since I had no idea what this is, I went reading into this.

So I created the following calculation (I may be completely off, if so, say this pls): SENS reported that with their new alliance with Ascenia, they will be able to launch the product in Europe. With their operation revenues of 10'016'000 they have approximately 101'000 customers (based on a product price of 99.-). If they are able to expand again (as they did over the last few years) their operating revenue in the US would look something like this (I took the quarterly data, removed the huge spikes and this gave me something of a growth rate like this)

:

Q1 2021	Q2 2021	Q3 2021	Q4 2021
11'531'000	13'087'000	14'853'000	16'857'000
This would lead to an increase in market share of SENS from 0.3% to 0.5%.

Calculation market share SENS:

Country	Diabetes	Product cost	Operating revenue	Customers	Market share
USA 12.2020	30'000'000	99	10'016'000	101'000	0.3%
USA 12.2021	30'000'000	99	16'857'000	170'000	0.5%


I tried to consider the expansion into the European countries as well, with the same market share as in the US.



Country	Diabetes	Product cost	Operating revenue	Customers	Market share
Switzerland	500'000	99	250'000	2'500	0.5%
Germany	9'500'000	99	4'700'000	47'500	0.5%
Italy	3'300'000	99	1'630'000	16'500	0.5%
Netherland	1'300'000	99	640'000	6'500	0.5%
Poland	2'300'000	99	1'130'000	11'500	0.5%
Spain	3'600'000	99	1'780'000	18'000	0.5%


With this kind of growth, the operating revenue would nearly triple from this year to the end of next year. However, I have no idea if I have done stuff correctly, nor does this have any scientific value. As I said, I did not study anything related to stocks.

Title: $PHE.L PowerHouse Energy Group, finally done with development of DMG technology
Is this financial advice? No

Am i slightly retarded? Yes.

Is the energy sector massively overlooked at the moment? Indeed

The following Quote is taken directly from the website: https://www.powerhouseenergy.net

"**PHE uses Waste to Energy expertise to help customers destruct and recover energy from their challenging waste streams**."

Useless, cheap and unrecycable plastic-waste can finally be turned into a monetized product, which also solves one of the greater challenges of mankind - dealing with waste streams

"**DMG Technology developed and owned by PHE delivers value for customers through producing electricity and hydrogen as well as other chemical precursors.**"

The end product can vary from Heat, Electricity and Synthetic Gas - one which is Hydrogen.

A key differentiator is that DMG can produce clean energy from ***ALL*** difficult plastics

The DMG technology is future proof and demand will increase eventually. Why? The process generates source of high purity hydrogen for vehicle fuell cells PSV &amp; HGV

The engineering behind the DMG technology is party patented and partly kept confidential, so that they can protect themselves.

So how does PowerHouse Energy plan on generating consistent revenue?

* Well it sounds promising: Revenues will be generated from licenses and engineering support of its DMG waste to hydrogen and power product
* Strong commercial partner in Peel NRE Environmental developing first facility and UK business plan of over 77 facilities
* The first application of the DMG technology is in develpment at Peel's Protos energy park in Ellesmere Port
* The Plastic Park is planned to handle around 300,000 tpa of plastic
* A target of at least 30 DMG sites around the UK will be achieved. Under the terms of the agreement with Peel, 30 operational sites would generate 15.0m **JUST** in annual licence fees.
* Subsequent to Protos the Powerhouse business strategy has limited risk exposure and low capital overhead.

And we are Talking just about potential Sites in England, while demand in plastic waste solution is increasing globally

Can this easily get to 0.5 - 1 in the next few weeks to months? Yes!

Ill definitely hold for long. I see alot of potential

Not a Pump &amp; Dump

Title: DLB and why it is undervalued for what it does
Whats good fellow gamblers, degenerates, quaalude parachuters, and newbies.

Its ya boy, ElJefe here and I am here to share with you how Dolby is an undervalued and often overlooked company that actually has more potential than meets the eye.

Dolbys most recent earnings from their fiscal 1st quarter showed a strong YoY total revenue increase of 33.57% ($389.9 million, compared to $291.9 million). Where it gets interesting is that their cost of products and services decreased by 10.47%, their cost of revenue decreased by 5.39%, and this resulted in a 39.28% **increase** in their gross margin. They were also able to shave 7.8% off their operating expenses while increasing their operating income by **239%**. Their  Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased from 0.64 to 1.48.

**Dolby is thickly cash heavy.**

They make most of their money from licensing its audio technologies to broadcasters, television OEMs, computer manufacturers, gaming console companies, and cell phone makers. With royaltys being 95% of their revenue, this is a strong business model that is able to create steady cash flow.

Their numbers are impressive and if you want to take a further look you can dive in here https://investor.dolby.com/news-releases/news-release-details/dolby-laboratories-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-2021-financial.

**Dolby Vision** and **Dolby Atmos** have been extremely popular and are used in Broadcast, Mobile, Consumer Electronics, PC, Cinema. Think of the amount of TVs, smartphones, home stereos, etc that are being sold that use these two technologies. Consider the recent iPhone super cycle as one example to put into perspective how many devices will be using Dolbys technology. Also consider that the demand for premium home entertainment has increased due to people spending more time at home. One other thing is that there is a higher demand from e-commerce platforms for audience-engaging content, which is increasing sales of Dolby Vision. Then there are the movie theaters, once they reopen of course, which is going to even further increase cash flow.

Do you know a company that uses Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos a decent amount? Netflix. 

 
They of course have other products: long list &gt;! The company develops and licenses its audio technologies, such as AAC &amp; HE-AAC, a digital audio codec solution used for a range of media applications.; AVC, a digital video codec with high bandwidth efficiency used in media devices; Dolby AC-4, an audio coding technology that delivers new audio experiences to a range of playback devices; and Dolby Atmos technology for cinema and a range of media devices. Its audio technologies also include Dolby Digital, a digital audio coding technology that provides multichannel sound to applications; Dolby Digital Plus, a digital audio coding technology that offers audio transmission for a range of media applications and devices; Dolby TrueHD, a digital audio coding technology providing encoding for media application; Dolby Vision, an imaging technology for cinema and media devices; Dolby Voice, an audio conferencing technology; and HEVC, a digital video codec with high bandwidth efficiency to support for media devices. In addition, the company designs and manufactures digital cinema servers, cinema processors, amplifiers, loudspeakers, hardware components, video conferencing solutions, and other products for the cinema, television, broadcast, communication, and entertainment industries. Further, it offers various services to support theatrical and television production for cinema exhibition, broadcast, and home entertainment. The company serves film studios, content creators, post-production facilities, cinema operators, broadcasters, and video game designers. It sells its products directly to the end users, as well as through dealers and distributors worldwide.!&lt;

Dolby is arguably one of the most expertly managed technology companies from a financial standpoint.  Their capital deployment philosophy includes investing in new growth technologies and rewarding shareholders with dividends and buybacks. Their balance sheet never carries any long-term debt and currently includes $1.1 billion in cash...

Seems like a steal for $93...


In with 06/18 $95 calls.

Title: SNDL: Harvard and Yale Business School Pro Stock Analysis of the Facts
Ive looked at all the data, I analyzed the tips of the graph and the circumcision aligns perfectly with the head so I think were in for an explosive boom. If it goes up just 100% and $3 but 12:00 tomorrow we can have enough money for a 2 for $40 special at Applebees to feed 50 bananas to each silverback gorilla in the Trader Joes parking lot. Obviously this will depend on bananas holding strong at $10 per bushel to create enough demand for 100 UPS drivers to ship them from South America at a cost less than standard postage per banana. Banana futures are sitting at $20 per barrel out of speculation that theyre switching from shipping in bushels to shipping and selling them by the barrel. 

Im buying the dip tomorrow if there even is one. It may just start off hard and stay hard the whole way through.

Title: WKHS DD: Zero chance of winning a significant portion of USPS contract
I fully expect to get pushback for this, but here goes.

**THESIS**

Workhorse (WKHS) is a self-promotion scheme more than anything else. It has a history of making grandiose claims of massive contracts with big respectable corporations, yet *somehow* they never see revenue or sales from them. And finally, the USPS has zero interest in dealing with WKHS, because they already kicked them out of the contract bid before.

In short, there is a near-zero chance that WKHS will see any significant portion of the USPS contract.

Part 1: History of Self Promotion

Part 2: The USPS Contract

Part 3: WKHS Manufacturability

Part 4: Positions or Ban

\---------------

**PART 1: HISTORY OF SELF PROMOTION**

WKHS has a history of claiming big contract wins. Yet time and time again, these contracts never materialize to any significant sales. Lets review:

* [In 2017, the CEO claims they had $300 million in pre-orders](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1113616_workhorse-ceo-300-million-in-preorders-for-plug-in-hybrid-pickup-trucks?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)
   * Near-zero revenues for the subsequent 4 years, need I say more?
* [UPS orders 950 vehicles](https://www.trucks.com/2018/06/14/ups-order-950-workhorse-electric-delivery-trucks/)
   * In reality, WKHS delivered 50 vehicles in 2018. [Workhorse still boasts about UPS as a "blue chip customer."](https://workhorse.com/company.html?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) But the standing 900 vehicles are *on-demand*, so UPS could do a test run with the first initial order. How'd it go? [Workhorse has been removed from UPS's sustainability reports.](https://sustainability.ups.com/media/2019-progress-report.pdf) 
* Fedex ordered 20 trucks in 2016
   * Only 2 were ever delivered. [They tried to make a whole press-run about the one delivered in 2018.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/05/01/1493806/0/en/Plug-Power-and-Workhorse-Provide-FedEx-Express-With-First-ProGen-Fuel-Cell-Powered-Electric-Delivery-Van.html)
* Several other small examples of press releases for small amounts of trucks ordered. Many only have a small fraction of the ordered amount delivered.
* Most importantly, as far as I can tell, there's NEVER BEEN A SINGLE RE-ORDER.
* [Now the company boasts of an order for 6320 vehicles](https://ir.workhorse.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/162/workhorse-receives-purchase-order-from-pride-group)
   * Let's take a look at that fine print: "The order is split between Workhorses C-1000 and C-650 models and is subject to various production and delivery conditions." Yeah, we'll see how that goes.

\---------------

**PART 2: THE USPS CONTRACT**

There is a near-zero chance WHKS will see any significant win from the USPS contract. This is best conveyed by the below timeline and the statements from the competing bidders Oshkosh-Ford.

First, lets go over the situation. The USPS has been looking to find a partner/s to replace its long-life vehicles. This is a massive fleet, and the contract's estimated value is around $6.3 billion over a few years. The Workhorse timeline in this multi-year bidding process is below, but the takeaway is that there are three bidders left:

* Workhorse
* Ford-Oshkosh
* Karsan-Morgan Olsen

*I'll get in to the bull arguments and the zero-emissions vs hybrid vs diesel bull arguments below.*

Here is a timeline of our Workhorse bid (CREDIT TO FUZZY PANDA RESEARCH):

1. In April 2015, Workhorse advances from 40 interested suppliers to the top 15.
2. [In September 2016, **Workhorse fails to advance to the top 6.**](https://www.postal-reporter.com/blog/usps-awards-37-million-in-contracts-for-next-generation-delivery-vehicle-prototypes/)
3. Later that month, Workhorse joins a team that did advance, VT Hackney.
4. From 2017-2019 USPS tests 50 prototype vehicles
   1. In Spring 2018, a USPS employee was hospitalized when a VT Hackney-Workhorse vehicle's brakes failed and the vehicle ran uncontrollably downhill. Testing was paused for their vehicles.
   2. Other failures during testing reportedly include: Vehicle running out of range (stranded), suspension broke when hitting railroad tracks, door failures, safety belt failures, and motors failing.
5. In November 2019, VT Hackney sold its stake in a potential $6.3 billion contract to Workhorse [for a mere $1m + $6.6m WKHS stock](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1425287/000162828019013414/wkhs-20191031.htm).

So, given the above, how are WKHS bulls so optimistic on their chances of winning? Well, it has to do with Biden's statements that he wants to [replace the entire US fleet with EV](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/biden-starts-the-electric-vehicle-race-with-big-plans-to-replace-the-federal-fleet-11611697897). He's also made comments on targeting a large percentage of zero-emissions vehicles. Remember, Karsan-Morgan Olson's proposal was a hybrid. And Oshkosh-Ford's proposal was Diesel. Only Workhorse had a true zero-emission proposal.

I use past tense because these are dynamic situations. And recent comments by Oshkosh management indicate that they plan to leverage Ford's recently announced E-transit (100% electric) as a potential option. See the following statements:

&gt;Weve got a very strong, very comprehensive bid that meets all of the needs of the U.S. postal service. So I mean, Ill repeat that, we do meet all the needs of the U.S. Postal Service. Meaning, if they want, under the Biden administration, more weight toward one type of propulsion than another, were ready for that. Now weve got our fingers crossed. We believe weve got high reliability solutions and hope to have good news at the next earnings call, John Pfeifer, president and chief operating officer of Oshkosh, said in a call with investors last week.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pfiefer said he expects the Postal Service to make a decision in March. [\[Source\]](https://www.trucks.com/2021/02/01/electric-mail-trucks-make-sense/)

And in the very recent earnings call (you can google transcripts, this website cannot be linked):

&gt;**Michael Shlisky (Analyst)**  
&gt;  
&gt;I also want to ask a quick follow up on another question about the USPS contract. Your opinion is based on the Ford Transit, I believe, and we've gotten since this last quarter, we just announced we just heard the announcement of the new Ford e-transit coming out here in 2021 so you comment that you can address whatever the USPSs needs are as far as our power train. Is it as simple as just substituting the transit for the e-transit or do you have to have a special reopening on the contract and new approval to kind of make that switch?  
&gt;  
&gt;**John Pfeifer (COO, Oshkosh)**  
&gt;  
&gt;So there's limited things that I can say about this program, not because I don't want to but because we're under a pretty tight confidentiality with the USPS. We don't have to reopen anything to address the needs that as they evolve with the contract. I really can't comment on the transit ban, because of confidentiality, but I can say that we don't need to go back and have some arduous task of reopening an agreement if the contract goes one way or another, we will not have to do that.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Wilson Jones (CEO, Oshkosh)**  
&gt;  
&gt;I think the foundational statement there is we furnished a program vehicles that meet their current and future needs. I think that's the best way to leave it, Mike.

So USPS has the following options:

1. Work with the no-name vendor with a history of catastrophic vehicle failures in its small testing batch.
2. Work with Oshkosh-Ford to update their proposal to include some reduced-emissions diesel vehicles for 2021/2022 delivery. These can be used in the future for rural environments with limited charging infrastructure. The 2022-2025 deliveries could be electric vehicles based on the best selling cargo van, the Ford Transit (E-transit).

Note the specific situation in #2 is pure speculation on my part. But either way, it is not a hard choice. Ford-Oshkosh has this in the bag. \[I haven't gone in to why Karsan-Morgan Olson isn't a strong candidate, since it seems like that is universally understood. I do believe they are likely a solid backup for a small % of the USPS contract, though.\]

\---------------

PART 3: WKHS MANUFACTURABILITY

I'll keep this short because it is already getting long. Workhorse has never produced its vehicles at this scale, ever. This is a massive risk. There's zero reason for USPS or others to take that risk on. I know, WKHS bulls say "Lordstown" like it means something.

This means nothing. Having a facility is not enough. Cars have tens of thousands of complex moving parts and require precise assembly and process controls.  If you don't work as an engineer, you cannot imagine the effort that comes in to developing, maintaining, and scaling a manufacturing process this complex. Until Lordstown can demonstrate that it can crank these vehicles out, it is simply a manufacturing space.

\---------------

**PART 4: YOLO**

Ford calls, Oshkosh calls, Workhorse puts. For those less risky, be sure to buy April calls and puts, since the USPS contract could be announced in late March. I have enough fodder to double down on FDs if my current March 19th OSK and WKHS positions expire before a decision.

Title: More $KT DD
Earlier today u/clubba posted some good DD on $KT - Korea Telecom - looking at the low price/book ratio. It's a good metric to get a lead on potential value plays (LOL at WSB turning into a value stock forum, way to go DFV), but there's more to look at.

Book value tells you if the company has underlying value or if it's just a house of cards. Price to book ratio tells you *what the market thinks of that underlying value.* In this case, almost nil. A good question to ask when you see a metric that seems way too positive to pass up is, why are other people passing it up?

First, more about the company: they do mobile networks, sat TV, finance (credit cards), and infosec services. They also do some robotics cause it's fun?

Telecom was one of the worst performing sectors over the past year, by the way. This can be a positive if you're a value investor-it means the price may be depressed by the broader industry.

To the stock itself, the value play isn't as strong as the price to book makes it out to be. Again, if that tells you it has underlying value, great. But is it making any money? Price to earnings is 8 or 9 (depending if you're looking at the past year or projected), compared to 12ish for the industry, another good sign. Earnings growth projections are positive also, but not phenomenal. Negatively, they did not pay a dividend last year, which is like value investor 101: show me the dividend! But they did announce a share buy back and a 2021 dividend. They have a comparatively small market, and have branched out internationally as a result. That can be expensive.

Tl;dr - I think there are positive signs for a long term value play, but what this company is lacking is meaningful growth. The point of investing is to make money, not just hold value.

I'm going to watch it, because if they do a spin off or some other move to position for innovation or greater market share then it could be poised to take off.

Title: Wed AM Gamma Analysis &amp; Trading Day Retrospective on GME, TLRY, APHA, SNDL, CRSR, AMC
Below is a dump of a bunch of popular tickers. Some don't have spotgamma data, but all have tradingvolatility data. This data is a bit stale - it's Wednesday AM data, so whatever happened today changed it in terms of option open interest.

[https://imgur.com/a/bEpZEBz](https://imgur.com/a/bEpZEBz)

**How to interpret:**

Whenever there is call or put open interest, it COULD BE options dealers are net sellers. Whatever the net 'short gamma' (total net options sold) by dealers will in turn result in gamma hedging as the price of the stock moves past. This generally means that dealers buy if the price going up, and sell if price going down, regardless of if they have short puts or short calls on the books. This effect can be as much as 80% of the total options outstanding in my experience, but is usually less. This caused a lot of the GameStop action we saw before known as a gamma squeeze.  It is possible to create the reverse, and that's a hobby of Steve "Stevie" Cohen (to sell a giant straddle and lock the price down). If a stock seems to be de-volatilized after I said it had a lot of gamma, there's some chance this happened. 

Delta de-hedging is also a thing. When options expire, speculators (read: you) tend to sell the itm options for profit, and tend not to roll them fully, which causes reversion against the options. In other words, if there are a lot of ITM puts expiring, the stock will tend to go up, while if there are a lot of ITM calls expiring, the stock will tend to go down. This tends to matter the most on the monthly and quarterly and yearly option expirations. This Friday appears to not be one of those.

Because this data is stale, you can't draw firm conclusions, and you'd want the update tomorrow if you have access to these tools (spotgamma and tradingvolatility, or you can add by hand). However, it's important to understand the magnitude of these gamma hedging effects by dealers. These are always relative to the floating shares of the stock. For reference:

AMC: 114m shares (Maybe, they just had a bunch of new issuances and debt conversion, could be higher)

CRSR: 88.1m shares

SNDL:435m shares

APHA:312m shares

TLRY: 137m shares

GME: 70m shares

In my experience, if a price move will involve 20% or more of the shares in open interest (options contracts x 100), it will tend to cause gamma squeeze effects in a lot of speculation. Numbers under this will still impact. It starts being not very noticeable at 5% or less for a price range (such as a 20% spread). Typically the price ranges you would look to would be plausible price ranges.

Today, a lot of weed stocks ran all the way up their gamma ramps and stalled, which means new gamma ramps need to be constructed, and I would expect it to be harder to move these weed stocks up more tomorrow except for SNDL (more on that below) For this reason, you will need to look CLOSELY at the new options printed for end of week and on as of tomorrow AM (or Thursday) when option data comes out. Right now, these stocks will look like all downside - gamma ramp below current position, since those stocks ripped through their gamma ramps completely today.

**Brief analysis:**

GME: I honestly have no idea. The stock is for sure gamma dominated right now, and getting past this expiry will reduce volatility a lot as things roll off the book. Interesting, there are a LOT of puts and most of the purchases of options appear to be puts right now.

**TLRY**: This just ripped through a gamma ramp, forcing buy of a remaining 5 or so million shares on the float of 137, which is a small effect. Most of the buying today was thus new capital coming in, which is quite remarkable. Looking at the OI tomorrow for expiry friday will be very important in understanding what is going on, but, **THIS STOCK WAS FUELED BY PURE NEW BUYING AND NEW CALL OPTION PURCHASE.** I guess there's no substitute for being "The" weed stock. Just remember that every dollar up requires the same amount of new capital as the last dollar - 50% days get a lot harder when already up 50% the day before. New gamma ramps will be created, but these get harder as IV has already risen a lot. Thus, would expect the momentum to continue, but this will quickly go into a bubble state like GME did. Be cautious!

**APHA**: This also just fully ripped through gamma ramp, and in fact did on Tuesday. At this point, it's all dependent on new open interest creation and money. Gamma ramp wasn't actually that big though, and the forced selling friday is small. This appears to mostly just be straight buying. 

**SNDL**: I don't have data on spotgamma, so I had to rely on just tradingvolatility.com. My read is that this stock has an outrageous amount of gamma, on the order of the float of the stock, and you can expect more vol. This leads me to suspect that the float data isnt accurate (outstanding shares are 1.5b while float is stated to be 436m). There are some moderate ITM call expirations Friday, on the order of 15-20m shares on a float of 435m shares, so I dont expect a huge impact.  But, this stock appears to be pretty spring-loaded with options and could go nuts again.  Examining data tomorrow will be important.

**CRSR**: This isnt actually that gamma dominated at a float of 88m. Its right in the middle of a big gamma ramp, so buying will send it up fast  and selling will send it down fast. Friday expirations are not that significant. This stock will behave semi-normally as a result. 

**AMC**: Im not sure what the float is here, but the actual option OI suggests AMC is in the middle of a gamma ramp, and that gamma ramp is immensely strong relative to float  this stock is expected to continue a lot of volatility unless these options are a bunch of covered calls or covered puts. My suspicion from price action is that they are not, and this will keep being very volatile. This ramp will lose strength in the 8s, so it will require a much heavier lift to get past there. Friday expirations are immaterial. Selling also can send it down, much like CRSR. 

*My positions: I own none of these!  But I'm long the market, and you guys dumping your winners to buy TLRY and similar is I think why NDX took a dump this morning, and that kind of hurt. Fortunately I did hold, and did buy the dip, and did buy TSLA calls. Which I'll regret because you'll probably sell more TSLA to buy more TLRY tomorrow.*

Title: $FSR - DD on Fisker, an undervalued EV company with massive potential upside  
Retards, degenerates, smooth brains, and aspiring autists:

I present to you some good ol fashioned DD on Fisker Inc., an EV company that aims to produce the most sustainable and emotionally desirable vehicles on the market. I wont confuse you all with charts and too many numbers because I barely understand them myself. 

Fisker Inc. is a startup company led by legendary automotive designer Henrik Fisker that is set to begin producing a fully-electric SUV, the Fisker Ocean, in 2022. 

Two things put this company above its competitors. First is the asset-light business model, which means the company outsources production to one of the most well-respected car manufacturers in the world, Magna. Second, the Fisker Ocean will retail starting at an affordable $37,999 before tax credits and will have a no-commitment lease option as well. 

The stock hit an all-time high of $23 back in November and has been consolidating in the $14-$16 range for a few months, making now a great time for an entry before this inevitably runs to a new ATH. 

This company is debt-free, has around $1 billion in cash and is looking to have a lineup of 5 cars by 2025. 

There is certainly some risk with the production timeline still so far out and the EV space being so crowded, but Fisker is currently undervalued play compared to the rest of the market that has both strong short-term and long-term potential.

Positions: 3/19 $15c, 5/19 $17.5c

This is not investment advice. Please do your own independent research. I eat soap for breakfast.

Title: $TLRY
$TLRY and $APHA are scheduled to merge in Q2 in an all stock deal. $APHA investors will receive. 8381 shares of $TLRY. 

In these mergers hedge funds usually make their money by doing something they deem risk free called arbitrage. By shorting the expensive stock and being long on the less expensive stock it doesn't matter if the stocks go up or down the only thing that matters is that on the merger date they would be worth whatever the price paid for them is. 

So in $TLRY and $APHA case in an arbitrage position the profit is the difference between where they are now and where it would be if $APHA is 83% of $TLRY stock price.

So here is where we could blow up the hedge funds.

SHORT SQUEEZE $TLRY. 

Instead of TLRY becoming closer to that 17% premium the difference in price has widened and there is a lot of institutional shorting going on. Short interest is currently 37% of the free float. One out of every three shares floated is being shorted.  

On a low volume stock. 

TLRY could also with that higher share price renegotiate the deal and get more APHA shares or look for a different target to merge with. 

As TLRY shareholders we could call for a vote (forcing all the shorts to close) to form a comitee to entertain buyout offers.g

Title:  The case for Canopy Growth (CGC): THC DRINKS 
Imagine you have the main ingredient to any beverage containing alcohol and there are only ~5 major  competitors in the world (who have the right connections). And now imagine that instead of alcohol it's a substance with no calories, no hangover, no increase in blood pressure, and it just mellows you out during a time when the whole world is on edge. 

--

Several Dems (Cory Booker just this week) have said they're voting on weed by the end of the year. 91% of America supports legalization.  


Weed drinks will be one of the biggest profit centers. That's where a lot of the money. Consumers with money won't smoke or eat weed. I know eating is the same as drinking; but consumers are foolish and many will want to consume weed like beer / wine. Smoking certainly isn't for everyone


CGC just delivered another quarter of record revenue. They are building a track record winning in core markets, while also accelerating their US growth strategy. Their CEO, David Klein, was a top executive at Constellation Brands, one of the biggest alcohol distributors in the entire world. Constellation Brands

CGC has also the advantage of a portfolio of compelling brands like Martha Stewart CBD, BioSteel, This Works, and Storz &amp; Bickel. It helps that the company has a strategic relationship with Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ), which is one of the worlds top players in the markets for beer and wine.

The company has been spending large resources in developing the right brands and distribution in the U.S. Another key has been purchase of 70% of the equity in Acreage Holdings (OTCMKTS:ACRGF). The company has an end-to-end platform in 15 states, covering cultivation, processing, dispensing and branding.




**TLDR: Patch 4.20 released. WEED = NEW META. $CGC for steady highs. Raise a glass to THC. I bought at 46. Tomorrow there will be more of us.**

Title: $TAKOF - Drone Delivery Canada About To Rocket (DD)
This stock has been quite bullish lately and on a steady rise every day. For Canadians the stock is called FLT on TSX &amp; is on the same rate. Both cheap buys with the potential of multi multi bag holder potential. Their biggest drones can carry 400lbs and has a range of 200km. They service mines, first nations areas, cargo ships &amp; lots of other hard to find areas. They are currently getting contracts to carry out vaccines &amp; much more. They're doing quite well right now with growing their business in the scope just discussed. Letters of intent, delivery contracts and no reason to stop growing. 


But if we're going to talk about long term potential, it's not limited to delivery of packages either. DDC has goodwill and trust from regulatory bodies. There aren't many companies doing what they're doing, and no one knows how to regulate airspace. DDC now has a track record of doing it, and maintains their open cooperative relationship with Transport Canada and other regulatory bodies. So when other countries start thinking about how to safely integrate drones into their airspace, who will they come to?


Finally, in my opinion they should be nicely positioned to expand into other areas with the expertise they develop from operating the package delivery drones. Human transportation (air taxi) drones, and industrial inspection and maintenance are examples of adjacent industries that have great growth potential and not a lot of competition. DDC will have built expertise that can pave the way there. Point being, they're not going to be limited to delivering packages. Not sure if they'll just spin off another company if they decided to do that... they are called Drone Delivery after all. It's just my take on it. In for 16327 shares $0.68 avg.

**Latest Catalysts:** Drone Delivery Canada plans to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) into its disruptive drone delivery solution (Source 4); Drone Delivery Canada has been named to the 2021 OTCQX Best 50 (Source 5); In January 2021, the FAA added new rules to 14 CFR Part 107 to permit the expansion of routine flights and created four categories of UAS for flights over suburban/urban areas (Source 6)

**Upcoming Catalysts:** release of Q4 and 2020 results; in July company started process to entering US market  at some point there will be announcement if this is a success.

**Industry Catalyst:** establishment of a legal basis for unmanned cargo air vehicles, battery technology and wireless charging developments.

Research by Goldman Sachs suggests the market potential could be as big as US$100 billion (CA$130 billion). Meanwhile, startups in the sector are nearly all worth less than $1 billion today (source 7  claims $TAKOF has multi-bagger also discusses $TAKOF cash position).

Title: Alpine 4 Technologies. Or why I learned to love the drone.
ALPP DD

ALPP // Alpine 4 Technologies

Disruptive technologies &amp; acquisitions.

The biggest catalyst here is lots of talk of impending uplisting to NASDAQ- They announced intent on Dec 20, 2020.

Its on a fucking tear. 300% in a month. It takes breathers, then keeps running.

1.26B market cap. Small enough to have a lot of room for growth, big enough its not a penny stock. Also, 125 Million shares. This isnt something like NOK with a bazillion shares.

It has a community here on reddit. r/ALPP

They keep buying companies.

They are in drones, self driving cars, safety, automation. Basically most of the hot girl shit.

Their revenue is growing. They actually make money unlike a lot of the shit you people buy.

They have IP, they have patents, they have proprietary stuff.

They are working with a company they bought to set a world record with a delivery drone, that means press, press means money.

They keep buying companies.  Like a lot. Like 3 in the last 4 months.

They are a domestic drone maker, and since Chinas on the naughty list, DJI is fuk.

The military likes drones, and they are a more practical, less messy way to kill people.  The US kills people when they get bored, and I think being covid shut ins is making generals bored.

The bad: Their website sucks. They have fanbois. Its playing in the minors right now.

Thank you for attending my elevator speech.

Title: A Strong Case for the TLRY Shorts - Don't be left Holding a Bag
 TLDR: Are you really going to tell me that a merged Tilray and Aphria warrants Tilray trading at 4x Googles revenue multiple and 2x Teslas multiple when they dont even have positive cash flows? No EBITDA? Dont let yourselves get caught up in the hype brother monkeys. **TLRY puts to the moon**.

Listen up yall. I know we hate contrarians here, but hopefully, some of you monkeys can put on your thinking hats for a second and gather round. Remember, true diamond hands dont care if the stock goes up or down, they observe the facts and make sound decisions based on them to amplify their own profits. Now lets learn some basic corporate finance together.

We need to talk about TLRY.

As you all know, TLRY spiked todayand the day beforeetcup to almost $70 per share. Some of you made money on calls, and Im proud of you, but this pump is going to end and Im here to explain why.

Obviously, everyone is going to point to the obvious to counter my short term bear view - the merger with Aphria. Im not going to waste your time telling you why this merger might not even happen; no - instead Im going to humor you and assume it does in my simple analysis. Im going to use only numbers directly from TLRYs merger announcement presentation, which you scrubs can find [here](https://ir.tilray.com/static-files/42b99b9b-5574-499d-b266-aabd0393103e).

Lets start with two basic facts:

TLRY Current Share Count: 158.3 million

APHA Current Share Count: 316.7 million

Now, the merger proposal says essentially this: the two companies will become one company  nothing will happen to TLRYs stock (it will roll over into the new company), but Aphrias stock will be converted into TLRY shares at a ratio of 0.89:1. This ratio is our first new term of the day: the conversion ratio.

We can multiply the Aphria share number by this ratio to get the number of shares it converts into pursuant to the merger. The resultant number is about 282 million shares. Now we add this to the number of TLRY shares that roll over, and we have a total outstanding shares post-merger of \~440 million. This number is called the Pro-forma shares outstanding.

Now, we take the Pro-forma shares outstanding and multiply that by the share price (everyone is saying this whole pump is share-price merger arbitrage anyways) to get the Pro-forma market cap: a whopping $31 billion US dollars!

Now, we need to take a second and look at this number. The market cap is essentially a proxy for what the market thinks the companys equity is worth after removing all of its debt. The fact that this is what the market is saying the Pro-forma company is worth is absolutely ridiculous given it doesnt even make money.

But anyways, carrying on with the valuationwe add the merged companys debt to the market cap to get enterprise value (I'm not worrying about cash for you hardos out there, just trying to illustrate a point here)  and we get an enterprise value of 31ish billion dollars. This is essentially the value of the Company as indicated by the market.

Now we can start looking at multiples. You may be asking yourself, young monkey, Why do multiples matter?. Well, they essentially give us a way to value stocks relative to one another. This type of valuation, simply enough, is known as relative valuation and is used every day by the top investment banks and hedge funds in the world. One useful multiple in sales-driven businesses like this (especially those with no positive cash flows) is the enterprise value to revenues multiple. Generally, companies trade in a range that the market considers fair. Google is trading about 7x for example. Tesla is at 20 something. We can calculate this ratio for the merged company in question using the combined revenue figure provided in the merger documents and it comes out to..46x. Let me say that again: 46x. Thats saying this weed company that makes virtually no money on a net basis should be trading at higher multiples than even Tesla, one of the most historically high multiple stocks out there. This is so, so, so overvalued. A classic pump.

https://preview.redd.it/3lt39l3girg61.png?width=726&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e77602544f803e5ac58b150f3d60dd71f7bd6ea3

Just for shits and gigs I did this same analysis just looking at TLRY as a standalone company in the event there is no merger, and at current prices, the EV/LTM Revenue multiple is even higher at 60x. 60!

I just want to make sure you all dont get shafted here. You should not be paying this much for a Company with no earnings. Notes these numbers are conservative - I'm not even accounting for further dilution from insider options and convertible securities because you apes probably can't handle it. And dont tell me its about the potential. Potential isnt realized through a press release, and you know it.

Furthermore, legalization takes a long time to implement and these guys arent even US focused. Seriously  read their securities filings.

Also, keep in mind this merger was announced in December, and nothing materially altering profitability has been announced since then. WHY THE RUNUP? You're getting fleeced lads.

Title: Forget GME, AMC, weed stocks, all of that. You want to buy the alphabet!
Tired of GME and AMC and weed stocks? Have I got a deal for you! I was walking past some 5G towers after being vaccinated and got a brilliant idea: I should only use Windows phones and Bing as my web browser.

Then I thought about stocks and realized: I should invest in the fucking alphabet! On NYSE there's a bunch of one-letter stocks and surely they must be good, right? It's like if you get in on Gmail early and get your pick of any account name and decide to go with dick@gmail.com because you didn't stop and think that every idiot on the globe is going to mail you either because they need to talk to Dick or it got used as a spam-mail address or whatever.

Anyway. Single letter stocks! Just buy them all up, I'm telling you, the squirrels around the 5G tower assured me that the lizard people will guarantee mucho $$$$$$ if you buy them.

[I mean, just look at the S&amp;P performance from the past year, if you'd put money in booooring SPY, it's up 18.77%.](https://i.imgur.com/uGa5GN7.jpg)

[Whereas if you'd bought the alphabet you'd be up a whopping 24.72% and that's like, 420.69% more $$$$.](https://i.imgur.com/jvXUxkr.jpg)^*    

So there you go. BAM! Stock advice. You'd make a bazillion dollars more if you bought options instead of shares so yeah, credit cards wouldn't offer cash advances if they didn't want you to use them like that. Get some puts. Or shorts. I forget the difference, just go buy options, they're cool! Buy the alphabet and be the next DeepFuckingValue!

Title: NTDOY is the most undervalued company, how do you not see this?
Srsly, how has everyone missed this undervalued gem. Let's break this down simple:

1. This thing has a PE ratio under 18 putting its valuation lower than other boring value stocks like Cisco, Comcast, or Walmart. You even get a 1% dividend yield which is more than your Chase saving account provides you. You'd think having such a low PE under JPow's economy would mean this is a dead company with no prospects, but...

2. Their latest game console, the Nintendo Switch which has been out since March 2017 keeps selling units by the millions. 80 million Switch devices sold to date, 15 million of them in 2020 alone. They're still selling at a consistent pace at the mid-cycle of the console's lifespan. This would be bad if they sold it at a loss like new game consoles from the competition, but...

3. The Switch is cheap. You can get the Switch Pro for less than $300, or the lite for $200. When your console is so cheap not only can you sell it at a profit but your customers have more money to buy games. And who makes those games?

4. Nintendo has basically a monopoly on Switch games taking all the profit. This isn't particilarly hard when you own excellent IPs that raise nostalgia levels so high. All their 15 top selling games are self-published, 9 of them solely developed by then. Their top 6 each sold over 20 million copies, they're in 25+% of Switch owners. This is important when you factor in that 80% of games sold in 2020 were released in prior fiscal years so new Switch Owner will buy these same old games that already broke cost. And with such popular IPs they can even release phone quality games or emulated 10-20 year old parts at $50 for cash grabs. Only stronger competition could stop them, but...

5. You can't get a new Playstation or Xbox. Srsly, have you tried buying one? You get a notification from Best Buy that they have some in stock and that same minute when you try adding to cart it's already sold out. Despite the demand, the supply chain is so backlogged that less than 5 million PS5s have been sold.

6. CHINA - did you know that video game consoles were banned there until 2014? The Switch wasn't even launched there officially until 2019. This is a nascent new region for the expansion of the videogame industry, especially today when less than 2 million Switch/Ps4/xbox ones were sold. Of those, 1.3 million were Switch meaning they already have over 2/3s of this nascent new market share. As more chinese come out of poverty and try out these game consoles from their rich software engineer cousins who came to visit them from California, they will demand regulatory change to make it easier for video game consoles to sell in the country.

7. What about growth outside the videogame market? Well, they might be the future leaders of AR games. Mario Kart Live? Mario Legos? What other toy companies have you seen pushing the boundaries of AR? With their excellent IPs it should be easy to dominate the toys market, with total global market size of $100B.

8. All that hype is all well but what to the actual numbers say? Well, this baby had a Q1 - Q3 YoY growth in Net Sales of 37.3%! But there's more! The Operating Profit grew by 98.2% and the Net Profit by a similar 91.8%. How is this not a growth company? Stock is up 67% YoY but keeps being valued at low PE 

Price target? Do I look like an analyst? I'm just a retard who likes  and playing games on the couch while eating tendies. Maybe one day we'll be playing Nintendo games on Mars.

Title: $LUMN Blowout Earnings: $0.48 EPS vs. $0.32 expected
# Hello again my beautiful apes

**$LUMN** had a blow out earnings today, as we all expected.  


Link to my previous DD post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le80cp/follow\_burry\_into\_the\_darkness\_and\_he\_will\_show/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le80cp/follow_burry_into_the_darkness_and_he_will_show/)

# $0.48 EPS vs. $0.32 expected.  The "Street" is sleeping on this giant.

You can read their full summary here: [https://s24.q4cdn.com/287068338/files/doc\_financials/2020/q4/4Q20\_LUMN\_Earnings-Release\_2021-02-10\_Final.pdf](https://s24.q4cdn.com/287068338/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/4Q20_LUMN_Earnings-Release_2021-02-10_Final.pdf) 

I picked up more shares at $12.00 during the after-hours dip.

&amp;#x200B;

# Numbers

* Earnings **(that's right, this company makes money. what a concept )**  
for fiscal year 2020 were $1.801 billion compared to $1.409 billion for the year before.  
Have you ever seen a boomer telecom company grow **earnings** by 27.8% YoY, despite a minor dip in top line revenue?  I don't think so.  Leadership over at **$LUMN** has one thing on their mind:   

* Since the original DD post, a fellow ape  told me that learning multiplication would help me with my financial analyses. So I'll try that here.  
At an after-hours price per share of $11.96 with 1,085,666,000 shares outstanding, that puts the **P/E ratio** for the past fiscal year at **7.22**.    **BURRY** wasn't joking when he sniffed out the value here.  

* You might look at the report and see "-$2.12" EPS, but this is due to an accounting trick to write off the boomer parts of the business that they're divesting of.  Do the math yourself, retard.

&amp;#x200B;

# Congratulations to everyone who has followed me, and by proxy BURRY.

We may see a dip in the next few days because the market hates companies that make money, but don't fear. I'll personally be picking up more calls tomorrow if we continue to dip.

If you like  then don't sleep on **$LUMN**

Shares and LEAPS are the way to go.

Title: GME Ryan Cohen DD #stillholding #diamondhands #ilikethestock
 

* on November 16, 2020 The letter to GME Board of Directors, the title reads: Maximizing Stockholder Value by Becoming the ULTIMATE Destination for Gamers (Cohen didnt use the word ULTIMATE lightly, proof below)
* Cohen mentioned he wants to **disrupt industries**
* Cohen has done it before with this **ULTIMATE** Destination idea with Chewy **-** calling it the **1 stop solution** \- Chewy rapidly expanded product offering to include all pet food and supplies so there was never a reason to shop elsewhere. By 2018, 90% of our revenue was from repeat customers. Cohen is planning to do the same in Gamestock (and how did Cohen achieve (90% repeat customers? cont. reading)
* Cohen left Chewy because - Im a **business builder,** not a manager. My work was complete. But I was **no longer in FULL CONTROL.** And I **DIDN'T want a BOSS. (meaning he wont be passive in GME board, if the letter to the board didn't make the point clear enough)**

**Formula for creating Fans**(90% returning), not customers:

* **net promoter score** (NPS), a common measure of customer satisfaction, Chewy always 87 and above at Chewy. lemonade is at 70 . Netflix 68, Amazon 62, and Apple 68.
* New Hire - **Kelli Durkin, Senior Vice President of Customer Care**  Ms. Durkin, who previously served as **Chewys Vice President of Customer Service**, has a start date at GME of **March 1, 2021.**
* \- **handwritten holiday cards**
* \- Our customers would send us photos of their pets all the time. We **hired artists** to turn those photos into personalized portraits of their pets, which we sent to our customers. These are **high-quality drawings**, something youd want to hang in your bedroom. Today, **thousands of those portraits get shipped out every month**.
* **- flowers** when their animals pass away.
* \- A **24-hour** customer service line promises to answer any call within **six seconds.**
* \- And, yes, the **customer is always right.**
* \- If they needed something **faster than we could ship it, like that day**, we told them to go to a local store and buy it and wed **reimburse them**
* **- fairly common** to see calls with customers go on for **4 hours**. That was a good thing because we knew that **meant someone was happy**. **Who can argue for four hours?**
* This created Fans, just like Apple/Tesla - **Fans tell all their friends and family** \- When people shop at Chewy, they really understand **we care about them**, we care about their pets, and they want to tell all their friends and family." " i don't know too many businesses that ended up not being successful when they did a really good job at delighting their customers."

**Hiring**

* Will **hire the best people** and **delegate** into their areas of expertise. (proven by recent hires)
* We **hired for passion**. Many people quit stable jobs and relocated with their families from across the country to join us. It was a tremendous sacrifice that we never took lightly. (only 2% write back in linkedin)
* New Hire - **Josh Krueger, Vice President of Fulfillment**  Mr. Krueger, who previously held senior fulfillment roles at Amazon, Walmart, and QVC, has a start date of March 1, 2021. In his new role, Mr. Krueger will oversee the management of **e-commerce fulfillment centers.**
* New Hire - **Matt Francis** to the newly-created role of **Chief Technology Officer**. Mr. Francis has a start date of **February 15, 2021. Engineering Leader at Amazon Web Services.** responsible for overseeing e-commerce and technology functions.

**Mindset**

* P**rioritized long term growth** over short term profitability (just like tsla, amzn, turning GME into a growth stock, so a ps ratio of 1 is just crazy cheap now)
* A**ims for Hypergrowth**
* M**ove fast** \- In just 3 months we built a website, found a distributor and partnered with a third-party logistics company when starting Chewy. Expect to see the same in GME.
* **Workaholic** \- lead by example and expect my team to work hard too
* **Fast** \- **build Chewy first fulfillment center in 6 months rather than 18 months (as estimated by an Consultants initially)**
* Great character - **Respect co workers** \- And I couldnt expect them to treat each other with respect if I was being a **dictator.** **humble**
* **Confidence to be misunderstood,** to able to **believe in his vision** and see pass competing head-on with Amazon and the pets.com failure during the dot com bubble
* Aims to **underpromising and overdelivering on sales**
* **Simple formula** for success in Chewy that can be duplicated in GME 1. amazing customer service 2. low prices 3. fast shipping 4. selection
* **Dares to dream - aims to be industry leader** \- last thing you want to be is a subscale e-commerce company. Youre a dead man walking, and Amazon will crush you.
* **not afraid to go against** the the board/traditional rules - building a company in Florida rather than a popular tech hub. spending $3 million a month on TV ads, more than Home Depot HD -0.3%'s budget. hiring expensive executives even though we werent profitable. These decisions were some of the most controversial and required me being comfortable betting against conventional wisdom, and were often contrary to the advice of my board. Suffice it to say, I was not the most popular board member. (proof that he will make GME team do what he says/take over as CEO)
* Transformation of GME started - By the end of the latest fiscal year, GameStop will have closed more than 1,000 stores since mid-2019
* Adding PC gaming, computers, monitors, game tables and gaming TVs to its store.
* I learned the value of **hard work** and being a **jack of all trades**, and that you should **never be afraid to do things yourself.**

**Others:**

* **Ability to raise money** \- raised **6 rounds of financing** totaling more than **$350 million** from **T. Rowe Price, BlackRock, Greenspring, Lone Pine, Verlinvest, and the investment bank Allen &amp; Company for Chewy**
* Vertically integrated e-commerce requires **flawless execution** across many fronts  marketing, supply chain, merchandising, and everything in between
* **will protect shareholders** \- Those investors put their trust in me and my vision, Cohen writes, and I repaid them with returns.
* **never afraid to say no.** I was constantly bombarded with new ideas, and when youre growing quickly its critical to stay focused, so I said no to almost everything. Theres a time and place for ideation, but in the early days when resources are finite, its important to choose a handful of things and do them extremely well. (just like Steve Jobs)
* **can handle a big business** \- scaled from 3 employees in 2011 to over 9000 Chewtopians by 2018.

REMEMBER!!! Cohen aim to Maximizing Stockholder Value by Becoming the ULTIMATE Destination for Gamers. ULTIMATE. I for one wants GME to go into manufacturing and make a Macbook quality Gaming laptop. Its about time this thing gets made)

Title: Hexo, go easy on me first DD
Whos ready to here the why HEXO can itself to becoming a major player in weed

1. Why would you ever put money into a HEXO thats up over 100% in the last month that just went through a 4/1 reverse split to be eligible to be put on the NYSE???

Well let me answer that question for you children. HEXO OWNS THE #1 POSITION IN WEED DRINKS IN CANADA! They own 42.5% of Truss, A company that is targeting the 71% of Canadian pussies who get turned off of weed because they have to smoke it. Ive never met someone who hates being high (under the correct circumstances) but I know a lot of people who hate it smoke. What if they can  it?? Do you understand the potential, currently weed beverages are currently 1.9% of the Canadian market (1.4 US), experts agree that weed bevs can grow to 15% weeds total sales

2. But lets talk about how much money are they are losing... because they did lose $170m million in the Q2. They only lost 4.2m in Q3. Not to mention CGC, currently having one of the largest market cap evaluations at 20B market cap only posted 440M net rev, compared to HEXOs 41M with only a 1.24B market cap. Now lets get to what everyone wants to here about. Are they really growing though? 

3. TLDR on weed stance 

Heavily invested in Quebec, Greece, and Colorado. They arent branding any further currently (waiting for American legalization imo). They produce way more bud then they can sell but because the price of a gram has fallen from 5.29 last year to under $3 now they have been able to ram up sales and cut their net losses to only 4milly last q. They are still producing 50% more weed than they can sell ready for a wave of legalization to expand their cannibals reach.

Main highlights highlights. Up 114% in gross revenue from the comparative prior year. Net revenue is up 103%. Expanding reach into Alberta(18% total sales), Ontario(15%), and British Columbia(6%). They have the #1 market share in Quebec. Each province having a strong tourist presence. They currently have 150m in straight cash.

Title: [GME] Volume vs Price Linear Regression Analysis. A comparison with AMC + Others
Hey everyone,

I'll start off by saying this is not financial advice, do you baby. I'll also say I'm NOT an expert. I had some experience trading before the GME hype, mainly in ETFs, and I've taken Finance courses in college, but that's it. 

In any case, I noticed how weirdly correlated the GME Volume and Price were as I watched my gambling money wash away. But that was purely anecdotal. So I wrote a simple script to pull the Volume and Price of 10 stocks, including GME and AMC, every 60 seconds or so. [This was pulling directly from Yahoo! Finance, here's GME as an example](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/). The script was just looking for the Volume and Price on each stock's page. The tickers I chose are:

* AMC
* ATVI
* GM
* GME
* JPM
* SNDL
* SNOW
* TSLA
* UPS
* V


The criteria was just "fairly popular stocks", so if you all have suggestions of other stocks you'd want to see, feel free to comment.


I left this script running from 1:47 PM until 7:02 PM, which gave me a total of 210 observations per stock. The scrape failed twice, once for GME and once for ATVI, so I have 209 observations for those.


What I found was surprising to me, but I am not savvy enough to know if this is a "sign" of anything. So I'm leaving it up to you apes. [Here's an album with the Regression Analysis results from each of those tickers](https://imgur.com/a/U7myXa2). You'll notice that the R^2 for GME is off the charts, at 90.7%. The second highest is TSLA, with 70.9%, followed by UPS, at 68.5%. 
 Here's a general definition of R^2 : 
&gt;R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. It is also known as the coefficient of determination, or the coefficient of multiple determination for multiple regression. 0% indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean.

Here are the R^2 values for all 10 stocks (all in the album above):

* AMC: 0.6766
* ATVI: 0.579
* GM: 0.0012
* GME: 0.907
* JPM: 0.6203
* SNDL: 0.3488
* SNOW: 0.0948
* TSLA: 0.7087
* UPS: 0.6852
* V: 0.39


I believe this is telling us that there is an extremely strong correlation between the Volume movement and the Price movement, so as the volume goes up, price goes up, as the volume goes down, price goes down. This relationship is also much much stronger than in any other stock. So what can/does this mean? I cannot conclude if this is shady or not, but with everything else going on (weird sub behavior, media blitz, RH being ass), I can't help but think this is odd. And my point here is not to claim I've made some ground-breaking discovery, I'm looking to use the data we have available to better assess my GME position. My current "reasoning" for holding is that there's a lot of "weird" things going on and each one is getting brushed off individually as "maybe it's this, maybe it's that". The point of this post is to add to that weird pile (what your wife's bf calls you).

PS: I understand this is an overly simplistic model, with one variable. I also understand my observations are from one day and the sample size is not large enough to make perfect conclusions.

&amp;nbsp;

#Major competitor

The current competition is IDEXX Laboratories (NASDAQ: $IDXX). It's worth noting that vets currently have to send off samples to these guys and not only is it expensive, but it causes delays in diagnosis (days). TRUFORMA allows for the same tests to take place, on-site at a fraction of the price within 18 minutes. Key members of the IDEXX team have left the company to join Zomedica.

#News and upcoming catalysts

Zomedica had 2 fantastic weeks, it's price is rising since they announced truforma will be launched at the end of March.

&amp;nbsp;
When the stock price was at almost $3 they announced a *BOUGHT DEAL* to rise 173.5 millions dollars at $1.90 per share. Surprisingly this happened just 2 days ago and the price already recovered and is now around $2.55 per share.

&amp;nbsp;
Zomedica announced that the money will be used to speed up the research and launch of new products.

&amp;nbsp;
 As of today Zomedica is **DEBT FREE**

&amp;nbsp;
The upcoming financial annual report that will be published at the end of this month, the announcement of a new big potential investor who bought the offered shares, and certain news about Truforma when close to launch could really trigger an unprecedented rise of this stock.

&amp;nbsp;
By investing today you could easily have a share worth up to $8 on product launch, or even double digits when they'll be announcing new incoming products and patents. This is a stock that has common sudden bull runs and a community of retailers who are expecting to hold their shares for years.

Title: Pass the bong and gather round, bros! We're gonna like....um....what were we doing again? Oh yeah, we're gonna talk about those Chronic stocks and how you Ganja Gorillas can avoid becoming Game Gibbons

Cool, cool.  So whatchu holdin', homey?   Tillllllray?  Aw yiss.  Aphria?  Yeah, she fine as hell.  CGC?  Oh lawd, dat ass is bangin'.  ACB?  Aw man, you like the classics, that's dope.  OGI?  Into the up and comers, respect young blood.  SNDL?

&amp;#x200B;

SNDL?  For real?  Dude....

&amp;#x200B;

Hi all, NrdRage here.  You might remember me from such hits as "pegging $GME dead right multiple times during its bubble, making everybody rich on $RIOT, exposing the $PLUG infinite money glitch, accidentally helping start the $BB craze, never getting an $AMD weekly call right and being in an abusive relationship with the VIX" or maybe "The SEC and you:  How you can just say no to having them shove a Mister Fister up your ass".  Alright, apes, it's been a great few days being able to throw a dart at a wall of weed stocks and no matter where it sticks, you make money.  It's been a great run.  But if you're going to expand the acreage of your jungle and the amount of lady gorillas you earn the right to mate with, you gotta start thinking a bit.  And that means - hear me out - thinking of how the hell you plan on getting out of SNDL alive.  And yes, I realize I'm saying this right after it spiked almost a hundo percent in the last 24 hours.  Look, I was playing it, too.  I grabbed some 2/19 3c's and a shit ton of 1/22 1.5c's on Tuesday.  I also got out of both of those today, though not as high up as I could have.  If you check my history, you'll see I even said I was goingt to eye a re-entry.  Then the market took a giant dump and gave me that entry, but I passed on it because I had done some research by that point.  Whatever, profit's profit.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the TL:DR:  It's basically a penny stock that's gotten pumped to hell.  But the smart ape realizes when something has gone too mainstream and gets out of the way before the bulldozers wipe out his trees.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey, I love shoving a share price around a bit as much as the next guy, I ain't gonna talk shit about that.  But it seems like nobody has an exit strategy for this, and I'm starting to see a lot of really stupid shit about Holding to 42.69 and all the other ridiculous bullshit from people who clearly don't even know what they fuck they've invested in that the GME Gibbons fell for.

&amp;#x200B;

# Here's the reality of SNDL:

&amp;#x200B;

The company was on the verge of bankruptcy around Thanksgiving, they have no other markets other than Canada, which is ridiculously oversaturated with weed to the point that wholesale prices are less than a dollar a gram.  And they recently got forced to admit that their product fails to meet THC content requirements.

&amp;#x200B;

In case you're wondering what that means, it means they sell skunkweed that they cut with paper and sawdust to make it cheaper.  They sell garbage.  And everyone knows it - their brand is associated with low quality crap.

&amp;#x200B;

Plus, they actively solicited us to buy their stock to drive up the price, then diluted it to fuck with a billion share offering.  Now, to their credit, this not only enabled them to become debt free, but also up their marketing budget and spend some time trying to create a brand.  Don't get too excited, fucking Sam's Choice at Wal-Mart is a brand, too, doesn't mean you should stick a chub of their ground beef up your rectum.  By reason of them selling skunkweed, their margins lag well behind that of their competitors.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at their financials, they've got 615 million in cash laying around.  That's pretty good - except  they're a company that burns 250 million a quarter.  Which means they're going to dilute the fuck out of everyone again next month.  They've got no exposure to the US market, but had no problem dropping "rumors" that they were going to break in to the US market through licensing deals - which turned out to be 1 pot shop in Bellingham, Washington.  They have no real expansion plan anywhere in the world, for that matter.

&amp;#x200B;

# B...bu.....bu.bu....BUT NRDRAGE!  Stonk go up !  Look at it!  SNDL to the moon!       ).

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, I know.  It's fucking crazy to talk shit about a stock when it's seemingly mid flight.  But here I am anyways.  Not to talk you out of the weed party - you should totally keep playing that for all it's worth - but rather to get people to see that they've probably outgrown skunkweed now.

&amp;#x200B;

Look, the reason this thing mooned is because it was like a dollar.  Hell, it was 13 cents not too far back.  With a stock worth a dollar, it's easy to get a lot of other apes to throw a couple of bananas at it for the lulz.  It's easy to shove around a penny stock with an extra 10 bucks you have laying around from another trade somewhere.  But as the price goes up, so too goes up the perceived cost of entering.  I can make a strong (unassailable, in fact), argument that $APHA at $25 is cheaper than SNDL at 3.25.  But people are conditioned to like smaller numbers.  Unfortunately, as the GME Gibbons learned, eventually you run out of buyers, and then things go tits up real fast.

&amp;#x200B;

As the Prophet Biggie Smalls once said, Mo' Money Equals Mo' Problems.  We all know this equation to be true.  And here you are, sitting on bags of bananas you didn't know you were gonna have a week ago thanks to some stonk you hadn't heard of before yesterday.  You don't think you've got a problem, but you do.  Because those bags of bananas aren't edible until you turn them in to the bank for real cash.  If you're sitting on  bananas from the gold standard of the weed world (that would be, $TLRY), you're resting pretty easy that no other ape is gonna come by and steal your bananas.  There are gonna be lots of bananas to go around, and mostly we're just taking bananas from fools who think their bananas will be less later.  But you don't have that with SNDL.  All the bananas are currently sitting with people who think the bananas will go higher.  You can't all be right, especially when there are billions of bananas, and now your grandparents are starting to buy bananas because some Boomer on CNBC told them it would make their dick bigger and their friends think they were cooler.

&amp;#x200B;

# Again, I'm not telling you to leave the party

&amp;#x200B;

But, if you recall your dorm room years, the best pizza you could afford was the Tony's school lunchroom style shit for a dollar.  Then you managed to  hide a few bucks from the people who collect your student loans, and you upgraded to Domino's.  Maybe by now you're ordering from a local joint that makes it's own dough in house and the sauce is made with the love of an old Italian grandma who accidentally dips her sagging tiddies into the pot 3 times while making it.  That just makes it taste better.  That's science.  But I digress.

&amp;#x200B;

The point is, you can get better weed now.  You don't have to smoke the skunk.  So before you get the rug pulled out from beneath you and are stuck investing in shitty penny stocks again, maybe you should elevate your enterprise.  Let's take a look at your options:

&amp;#x200B;

# Canopy Growth

You could go with $CGC.  They not only sell higher quality weed, but are an established brand and also sell oils and shit to those hippie fucks who still think Burning Man isn't just a brogrammer beatfest and go to an acupuncturist to enhance their "luck".  They've captured that all important 65+ stoner demographic by marketing their shit as a cure for seizures, cataracts, and dry vag, so they've got a lot of revenue.  They've also had a much more muted rise this week because they just haven't been on everybody's lips, which means they've got a lot of room to run.  The downside here is they burn almost as much cash as SNDL, but they've also got more bullets.

&amp;#x200B;

# Aurora

If you go with $ACB, you're going with a company that's already gone through its "shady as fuck" stage and has re-emerged healthy from it.  You're also not only getting on weed, but the DIY urban chicken farmer types who want to grow their own weed.  They, too, have had a strong run, but have a lot more runway than most because they've actually got a really strong path to dominance in the US market once it opens up to them.

&amp;#x200B;

# Organigram:

&amp;#x200B;

Look, if your dick is still getting hard at the thought of playing a low dollar stonk or you've only got 28 dollars to invest, you could do a lot worse.  They've got strong branding, large growth potential, a management structure that doesn't seem to act shady, and they've run almost as well as the other new generation of meme stonks, but lagged back enough because nobody can fucking rmeember their name to where they can rubber band a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

# Tilray and Aphria:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm combining these because they're inexorably joined at the hip (or should be, more on that later) because the two of them are merging.  For those who don't know, sometime in Q2, every share of $APHA you own will turn into .833 shares of $TLRY.  Even though APHA is the one buying out TLRY.    This is basically the gold standard of weed stonkery.  When you start investing in these, you know you're a real investor.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the interesting thing with these guys, though.  Even though APHIA should be just slightly trailing behind TLRY in terms of stock price, it's currently trading at less than half.  With TLRY sitting at 73 a share as I write this, APHA should be at just over $60.  But it's at 29.  Now, obviously, this means that TLRY has a lot more momentum, and some of that is due to the fact that there's a mini (don't flog me for using the word, but it's true) short squeeze going on with that one, which has turned it into such a strong momentum play.  But APHA, by virtue of actual math, needs to be within about 17% of TLRY's price.  Which means APHA either needs to moon dramatically, or TLRY needs to fall precipitously.  Now either of those things could happen, but the momentum of TLRY is hard to stop, which means it's more likely that APHA rubber bands to catch up to it in the coming months.  Even if TLRY does falter, that means APHA still has to come up a bit to meet it.  Making APHA kind of a "can't go tits up" situation.  TLRY also has the benefit of having enough market cap to where fund bois will buy into it, whereas SNDL is too small to meet most of their requirements.    Which can further propel TLRY (and thus, drag APHA with it).

&amp;#x200B;

One of the interesting things that's been happening with this pair is that the order books, even though they should mirror one another, have completely inverted from one another numerous times in the last couple of days.  This, of course, was a bull flag for TLRY every time it happened, leaving APHA to compensate to try and catch back up shortly thereafter.  It's really easy money.

&amp;#x200B;

Fundamentally, these guys have one HUUUUUUUGE advantage over the others:  They secured the UK distribution, and now have the inside track to be the supplier for the rest of the Europoors across the pond who need to smoke a bond to help forget all the things wrong with them.  And if you don't think they won't be able to leverage that to be the front runners out of the gate when the US opens for business, then you definitely ain't black.

&amp;#x200B;

# Or, you can just stay where you are and do the   thing

&amp;#x200B;

Ask the $GME Gibbons how well that worked out for them.  The ones still holding that stonk are like that one dude sitting at the edge of the bar of the Viper Room, still rocking his mullet and chain wallet, just convinced that Warrant and Slaughter are going to ring in the glory days of hair metal once more and that Queensryche is going to start selling out stadiums again.  It's just sad.  You're flying right now, but a rug is gonna get pulled out from under you and then you're gonna have your own daily thread where you reassure yourselves that it's gonna be OK and that you're gonna ride it to a thousand one day.  Lots of us (myself included) made a fuck ton of money on GME.  And we've made a fuck ton on SNDL and the rest of the Weedies this week.  But there are always people who Melvin it and hang on to their position too long and get stuck.  That's gonna be a lot of you, but you shouldn't let it be you.

&amp;#x200B;

# TL:DR:  Smart apes should look at their much bigger pile of bananas from SNDL while you're way ahead and upgrade them to plantains before the other apes.  Plaintains equals breeding with better apes, not low quality apes that cannibalize fellow apes and give ape diseases.

Title: $BMBL Big time play
$BMBL

I will be going in HEAVY on this one. 

Reasons being:

1) Covid. The amount of single people right now outweigh people in relationships (loser lost of you autists fucking your hand) 
2) GME AMC and all that brought an entire new species of people to be trading. 
3) A lot of the new traders are looking to make back their bucks from GME AMC etc
4) People can relate to and with Bumble. All of them are on it or using it to get laid so therefore I think it will have a ton of people interested. 

Hopefully there will be options availabe. 

BMBL IPO couldnt be timed better. IAC has seen its shares rocket up 225% in the past year as stuck-at-home people turned to apps for social connections...

BMBL is coming in Low, BIIIIIIIG LOW.

Title: $BA, the hidden golden egg
So, I'm pretty retarded. Been here for a few months, know a bit, but I'm more of an expert in aircraft. Recently, as you may know, Boeing suffered several major issues with their 737 MAX aircraft, resulting in a 100 USD plunge. Soon after, the Corona virus appeared no less than a year later, resulting in an additional 200 USD plunge. They couldn't just stop the production line, and thus it resulted in Boeing having to [park dozens of their aircraft in the employee parking lot.](https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/06/boeing-737-max-grounded-parking-lot-759.jpg)

However, that's not important. What is important is the recent news that the 737 MAX is now allowed to fly once again, after being grounded since early 2019. This is also in line with the vaccine role out, which is likely going to result in a $BA surge back to it's original price or higher, due to the significant want to travel. Luckily for Boeing, they've got dozens of aircraft already prepped for use, they just need to sell them again. While the stock has been slow to recover, it looks like it will rebound and swing for the fences as airports reopen and people want to travel after being locked inside for so long, leading to a lucrative opportunity in the near future. 

TL;DR [Boeing, rocket emoji, 200 dollars, green arrow, moon](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ft8d3sF)

Afternote: if anyone wants to check this and double check my retarded ramblings and maybe put some math behind this, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Title: You Autists Are Really Buying the Wrong Weed Stonks
[deleted]

Title: Gold is the way! [BTG] [AUY] DD
Hello my fellow apes!

I'm here today to tell you about 2 good gold miner stocks I did my DD on, B2Gold \[$BTG\] and Yamana Gold \[$AUY\]!

My DD on B2Gold goes as follows. ITS UNDERVALUED! BTG produces 1 million OZ of Shiny pretty GOLD a year, has practically no debt (121k as of start of 2020). Half a billion cash on hand! Has a P/E Ratio of 8. The dividend the company pays is $0.04/share quarterly. The sales revenue in 2015 was 708.33 Million and in 2019 it was 1.53 Billion, year 2020 will probably top 2019 since gold price went up. Total assets of the company are at around 3.48 Billion while the liabilities are 818.79 Million. Gross Income in 2019 was $597.71 Million. The price of a stock is currently sitting at $5.05 Which is laughably undervalued .

Yamana Gold \[$AUY\] Slightly worse than B2Gold but still worthy stonk! Price per share currently at $4.91. Total debt at the beginning of 2020 was $991K. Gross Income in 2019 was $446 Million. It has a dividend of 0.02/share quarterly . P/E Ratio of 40 which is kind of poor. But the company is still worth way more than the sub $5 price it's currently at! The company is targeting production of gold to exceed 1 million oz per year! It also produces silver which is an additional bonus!

Full disclosure I'm 2000 Shares deep in B2Gold, average at $4.97 and 700 shares in Yamana Gold with an average of $4.84 per share.

I'm an idiot so this is not financial advice but with the money printer going Brrrrrr I believe Gold miners will have a good year in 2021.

Title: TLRY DD: 420.69% gainz
I'll keep this short because my smooth brain cant make long posts. 

TLRY is going to the moon. Today it closed at $63.91 and is now sitting at $76.41 after hours as I write this. The highest call option for Friday the 12th is $65. There are a total of 30,555 option contracts listed in the option chain. If TLRY closes above $65 on Friday, I think there will be a lot of buying pressure. Also, the latest short interest report from 1/29 listed a short interest of 51% of the float. Perhaps many of those shorts were closed today during the massive trading volume today. Perhaps they werent. 

TLRY also was granted clearance to import and distribute their products in the UK this week. Last week they were given the first (and only) clearance to sell their medical cannabis products in portugal. Looking at the news articles, it seems they are also selling in Spain and Germany.

No sources listed since you shouldnt take my smooth brain word for it. 

My positions: 15 shares of Tilray bought at $36 and 27 shares of Apharia bought at $15.87

Tldr: TLRY  

Title: Long $MOS / The Mosaic Company
TL;DR: The Mosaic Company is a U.S. phosphate fertilizer producer, and has tailwinds of (1) rising food prices and (2) favorable regulatory and monopol-y-ish market conditions. I think it could double over the next six months, and am in $35 LEAPs. Earnings are after market Wednesday Feb 17th.

The [U.S. Department of Commerce just determined](https://www.accesswire.com/628789/US-Department-of-Commerce-Issues-Final-Affirmative-Countervailing-Duty-Determinations-on-Phosphate-Fertilizer-Imports-from-Morocco-and-Russia) that phosphate fertilizer imports from Morocco and Russia, major players in the phosphate fertilizer arena, are unfairly subsidized, with subsidy rates of (a) 19.97 percent for Moroccan producer OCP (b) 9.19 percent and 47.05 percent for Russian producers PhosAgro and EuroChem, respectively, and a rate of 17.2 percent for all other producers/exporters. The U.S. International Trade Commission has a concurrent investigation to determine whether Moroccan and Russian phosphate fertilizer imports materially injure the U.S. phosphate fertilizer industry, with a final ruling is expected by mid-March. If the ITC's ruling is affirmative, then Commerce will issue countervailing duty orders, which will remain in place for at least five years. At a time when supply chains are fragmented and food prices are quietly inflating (see below), the U.S. is protecting its own.

Food price inflation may still largely be unnoticeable in the grocery store, but there are signs elsewhere. Look at the 1year charts for:

If I were a gamblin' man, which I clearly am, I would bet MOS's guidance during the earnings call in a week will be pretty good. However, this is meant to be a 6-9 month play at a minimum, not necessarily an earnings bet.

Title: $TRXC (TransEnterix): already over 1B market cap (DD)
Dear tards and ladymen,

**DOES EVERY SINGLE POST HAVE TO BE A SHITPOST ABOUT APES BAGHOLDING FUCKING $GME AND OTHER NEWFAG STUFF TO GET ANY ATTENTION?**

**TL;DR:**

**The rocket is taking off. Company good, system good, money not much. Competitor much money. Company promising. Shares cheap cheap, tendies lots. Shares is the play.**

today I want to bring $TRXC to your attention. I know you already know this stock, but bear with me. It has just crossed 1B market cap in a pretty awesome rally that started only a couple days ago, and it has grown over +46% today at the time of writing this DD.

But... who are $TRXC, you may ask?

TransEnterix build the devices... no, fuck this, the BATTLESTATIONS for surgeons to operate with the minimally invasive procedure known as laparascopy ([https://www.healthline.com/health/laparoscopy#:\~:text=Laparoscopy%2C%20also%20known%20as%20diagnostic,look%20at%20the%20abdominal%20organs](https://www.healthline.com/health/laparoscopy#:~:text=Laparoscopy%2C%20also%20known%20as%20diagnostic,look%20at%20the%20abdominal%20organs).). Their system is called SENHANCE. Essentially, a robotic device pokes some holes in your tummy and, without opening you up for good, some little arms with tools, cameras, light... are introduced in your poor unfit office body to fix whatever is broken. Afterwards, the holes are stitched together and you can recover quickly and with fewer marks.

OK, OK, you may say, "why should this shit interest me? Does this not exist already? How do they do it?". I am glad you ask! This does exist, yes, and the industry standard is the well-known Da Vinci surgical system ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da\_Vinci\_Surgical\_System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Vinci_Surgical_System)) by Intuitive Surgical ($ISRG). So what the fuck is interesting about $TRXC? A couple things:

\- Senhance is a more modern system, with haptic feedback and even fucking eye tracking for camera control. SAUCES:

[https://www.massdevice.com/transenterix-bets-haptics-senhance-robot-assisted-surgery-device/](https://www.massdevice.com/transenterix-bets-haptics-senhance-robot-assisted-surgery-device/)

The concept is that the surgeon and the machine FUSE INTO ONE, becoming, you know, a Robocop or something like that.

\- TransEnterix bets for AI-POWERED MACHINE VISION to, for example, make the system's camera automatically follow the tools being used and this beast already has THE CE SIGN FOR COMMERCIALIZATION IN EUROPE AND FDA CLEARANCE. SAUCES:

[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210119005296/en/TransEnterix-Receives-CE-Mark-for-Machine-Vision-System-in-Robotic-Surgery](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210119005296/en/TransEnterix-Receives-CE-Mark-for-Machine-Vision-System-in-Robotic-Surgery)

\- Insiders have started moving and buying more stock just two days ago (on Monday):

\- They have started training surgeons in Japan to conquer their market:

[https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/transenterix-announces-establishment-of-japanese-training-center-for-senhance-surgical-system/](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/transenterix-announces-establishment-of-japanese-training-center-for-senhance-surgical-system/)

\- And know the boring fundamentals:

Market Cap 1.182B (at the moment of typing this)

Public float 136.01M

You can forget about P/E but LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT ITS COMPETITOR, $ISRG:

Market cap 91.62B

Public float 116.49M

&amp;#x200B;

So while the float is admittedly larger for $TRXC, they are still extremely undervalued if they are to be compared with their competitor. Of course, of course, it's a small company and establishing new surgical standards is complicated but, to me, they look like a steal EVEN AT THE CURRENT PRICE. And... wanna see how much they were in the past?

[Oh yes, they were worth a couple dollars more...](https://preview.redd.it/h8spk6lbnpg61.png?width=1667&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea84da4efc9f9d94e6650c9ee908dfa2706401e1)

EDIT3: I don't have time to write too much about it right now (this already ate up my fun time today), but their management is also pretty good:

[https://transenterix.com/about/our-management-team](https://transenterix.com/about/our-management-team)

Might write something on them in the following days.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT4: I did find more fun time. Some doctors in Germany wrote a paper on Senhance, testing its feasibility, and compared it to Da Vinci:

[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11701-019-00980-9](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11701-019-00980-9)

The comparison with Da Vinci points out the reduced cost of using Senhance:

&gt;\[..\] the ability to utilize conventional laparoscopic 5- and 10-mm trocars stands out in comparison to the da Vinci robotic system which incorporates its own 8- and 12-mm ports \[[27](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11701-019-00980-9#ref-CR27)\]. Since fully reusable instruments are used by this surgical robotic system, an advantage regarding cost efficacy is expected when compared to the da Vinci system. Excluding the acquisition costs of the Senhance Surgical Robotic System, the robot-specific cost per case at our department was 800 Euros, covering the expenses for drapes, instruments and maintenance according to a flat rate-based service contract. This comes in contrast to costs as high as 1700 Euros for drapes and instruments with da Vinci robotic system while excluding maintenance and acquisition costs.

And another paper:

[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11701-019-01000-6](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11701-019-01000-6)

This paper is not accessible for free, so let me just copy the conclusions for you autists to salivate:

&gt;Our experience with diferent types of robotic surgeries allows us to state that the Senhance robotic system is feasible and safe for general surgery, gynecology, and urology, and a wider implementation of this system worldwide is simply a question of time.

Title: The Real Deep Fucking Value  KT Corporation
Apparently were all saying this now, but I am not a financial advisor and you should do your own DD.  With that being said, I present you with the following:


Im a fan of DFV the man, but Im more interested in really **really** deep fucking value.  This will likely be a long post, but I think youll find value in it if you can follow along (see what I did there?).  


For those of you kids who cant read good, Ill put the **TLDR** right here at the top:  KT Corp ($KT) is so undervalued its almost fucking embarrassing.   When I say undervalued, I dont mean by a little bit I mean if this thing doubled it would still be a good value.  At the time of my writing this, KT is trading at $10.62.  **A realistic price target, if the market were to properly value this company, is ~$30.00**  Ill go in depth as to why as we continue through this story, but the long and short of it is the Tangible Book Value of KT Corporation is $19.66/share.  What does that mean?  It means if KT declared bankruptcy tomorrow, was forced to sell off all of its tangible assets and pay back its debt, the remaining money to be returned to shareholders would be $19.66/share.  This does not take into consideration intangible assets  which have real value (in the $BILLIONS), but are harder to assess.  Again, its trading at $10.62 as of this writing (a price/tangible book value of only 0.54).  Value investors typically look for stocks trading at &lt;3.0 price/TBV.  Deep value would be &lt;1.0.  KT is trading at 0.54, and a price/book ratio of 0.42!  


Shares are cheap, options are cheap.  Do what you will  hell, sell it short if you want  but I like shares and calls.


**KT CORPORATE PROFILE**

KT Corporation (formerly Korea Telecom) is a South Korean integrated telecom conglomerate which was founded in 1885  but realistically in 1981 in a more noticeable form  with business operations sprinkled throughout Asia, Africa, USA &amp; Poland.  KT is South Koreas first telecom company and dominates Korean market share in many of the spaces in which they compete:


**Line of Business** | **% of Korean Market Share**
:--|--:
Mobile Services | 31.4%
Fixed-line local telephone &amp; VoIP | 64.9%
Broadband Internet Access | 40.9%
Pay TV Services | 31.6%


As a conglomerate, KT has their hands in a number of diversified pots.

**Products &amp; Services** | **% of Total Revenue**
:--|--:
Mobile Services (incl. 5G) | 27.3%
Fixed-line (incl. VoIP, broadband, data comm.) | 19.5%
Media &amp; Content | 10.1%
Financial Services (incl. credit card solutions) | 14.6%
Other (incl. IT, network services, real estate development) | 11.6%
Sale of goods (primarily mobile handsets) | 16.8%


Corporate Location Map:

https://i.imgur.com/syXIRxy.jpeg


KT has ~30% institutional ownership, with BlackRock being a large buyer in Q4 2020.  KT has also filed paperwork for a massive share repurchase program.  For what its worth in this day and age, the short % of shares outstanding is a measly 0.09%.  No one is going short on this thing at its current price.  Youd literally have to be insane to short it  itd be like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller.  


**FINANCIAL METRICS &amp; PEER COMPARISONS**

KTs balance sheet is rock solid.  While it may not have the booming high growth of clean tech or cannabis, it is still growing and maybe more importantly, doing so profitably.  I touched on the tangible book value in the TLDR above, but this cannot be understated.  If you were to liquidate the company entirely, shareholders would receive $20-30 per share after the debt had been repaid.  I have highlighted some comparison ratios in the images below to show the truly disgusting undervaluation of KT.  


Compared to US-based telecom services index peers:

https://i.imgur.com/iOmE5mI.jpeg


Using a comp multiple for valuation based on these index comps gives the following implied value per share for KT ranging from $26.33 - $109.88 (unrealistic top end):

https://i.imgur.com/0hYg7Zy.jpeg


Compared to industry peers/comps:

https://i.imgur.com/lT8uPvh.jpeg


The following comparison is really the tale of the tape.  When we look at tangible book value, we see that all of the peers are trading above the tangible book value.  This is obvious, given the share price should exceed the liquidation value.  But we see the opposite being true for KT.  Again, **it is trading at HALF of its tangible book value.**  You could theoretically buy up all of the existing shares, liquidate the company, and double your money.  This is what I mean by real **deep fucking value.**

https://i.imgur.com/vGaVp9b.jpeg


Not that we put much weight in them around here, but all of the analysts are bullish on KT as well, with median upside of 33%.

They just published their updated earnings presentation and have positive forecasts for growth as well:

https://corp.kt.com/eng/attach/record/2020/KT%20ER%20PT%204Q20%20ENG_FIN.pdf


I am long shares and 07/16/21 $15 calls.

Everyone looks for the **TLDR** at the bottom (I put it at the top of the post), but here it is:

Massively undervalued, $30/share realistic price target, it's trading at half of its tangible book value - meaning you could theoretically buy up all of the shares, liquidate the company's tangible assets, pay back the debt and be left with 2x your money and still have all of the intangible assets. This is REAL value.

Title: $ACB DD
I was in ACB like over a year ago and lost a lot of money on it,  but this time is different.  Why?  because we got big money behind it,  the momentum, and so many states have and will continue to legalize.  ACB is poised to sell a lot of product and already owns many farms, while other companies like gay ass tilray do to but I think it is overvalued.  Tilray is big gay and only $BB gang would buy that shit lol.

Title: Expecting My PLTR Lockup to End on Feb 18th
I've seen lots of incorrect information posted on when the PLTR lockup expires, so I'd like to share that I expect that my currently locked shares will be cleaned/unrestricted at market open on 2/18. Directly from a Palantir press release:

&gt;*\[the lockup\] is expected to continue until the* ***start of the third trading day*** *following the date of public disclosure of Palantirs financial results for the year ending December 31, 2020*

Assuming that  the disclosure of Palantirs 2020 financial results happens as scheduled at 8AM ET on the 16th, here's my understanding of the trading days following the disclosure:

* **Feb 16th is the first trading day** following the disclosure of Palantirs 2020 financial results 
* **Feb 17th is the second trading day** following the disclosure of Palantirs 2020 financial results 
* **Feb 18th is the third trading day** following the disclosure of Palantirs 2020 financial results, and I'm unlocked at market open.

Title: WKHS USPS contract
BLUF: I am long WKHS and believe American-made EV should be the new USPS mail truck. Long time commenter, first time DDer; and I am not sorry about my lack of emoji inclusion in this DD. This is for pure autistinal personnel.

This is my take on a lot of DD going around WKHS. This is NOT an explanation of a possible short squeeze or how we will stick to the HFs. Fuck that Im just trying to pass along my ideas and share them with yall to get rich; if you like them great! If you dont, great, but also fuck. This is also not technical analysis. I can make another post with my cup and handle patterns and bull flags showing up everyday indicating bullish trends but I really believe that you cannot use TA to predict the USPS. Sources for technicals are at the bottom.

WKHS price in the short term is almost entirely dependent on the USPS contract. They (the USPS) have been pushing back and pushing back the deadline to make the announcement on who gets USPSs $6bb contract and hopefully we are approaching the finish line based off a board of governors meeting that occurred this week. Publicly there is no break-out candidate but WKHS is one of three, but most likely one of two remaining companies to replace the USPS fleet (~165,000 vehicles). The other finalist, Oshkosh, is teaming up with Ford, but their submission is still an ICE which does NOT meet the request and intent of the presidents Zero-Emission initiative. Lets pause and talk about Biden and the USPS for a second and Ill put it in bullet form so you morons skip to this part immediately:
    -Biden wants to electrify the entire US government fleet
    -Biden wants to the fleet to be 100% AMERICAN made vehicles
    -F is not 100% american made (something like only 64%, and even less for their future EV)
    -OSK/Fs submission is an ICE (they are planning EV but it was not their submission to the USPS contract bid)
    -WKHS is 100% manufactured in the USA
    -WKHS specializes in EV delivery vehicles and already has partnerships with all major delivery players
    -WKHS has patents and improvements to last-mile delivery

But even with all that info, some may still push for an OSK/F vehicle since they already have solid partnerships with the federal government. Lets talk about that: OSK has a relationship with the military to make Humvees and other huge gas guzzling trucks for military purposes. But this relationship is with the federal govt and will not influence the USPS decision. The USPS is an independent agency under the executive branch of the government. Who is in charge of that branch? Exactly. (That is why Trump had so much influence over the last 4 years in the USPS and vote-by-mail, but not the time for this discussion). The USPS is also a for-profit agency AND RECEIVES NO DIRECT TAXPAYER FUNDING, but continues to operate at a loss. The USPS spent $706.2mm maintaining their fleet of shitty ICE clunkers in FY2019.

Short of Elon Musk going out and mailing his entire fortune in nickels to the ISS via First Class Mail, what better way to reduce cost and increasing revenue than by going completely EV. The USPS MUST reduce cost and improve technology chain to remain competitive:
    -ICE repair and maintenance cost per mile ~$0.028
    -EV repair and maintenance cost per mile ~$0.012
    -Total savings per vehicle for lifetime by using EV: ~$4600

The USPS is run by a board of governors who in turn elect a Postmaster General. They operate like any board of directors and must answer to deficits and losses. It is imperative for the USPS to remain up to date on emerging technologies to reduce cost of delivery. Which brings us to another point: Last Mile Delivery.

Last Mile Delivery accounts for more than 53% of total shipping cost. Last mile delivery is the distribution center to your doorstep (literally where USPS operates). It costs $10.10 to deliver a package to your door, but USPS is charging $8.08. So they are already operating a loss. Why is this so expensive?
1) Lower average speed + more time on the road = fewer mpg
2) More stops leads to more idling and more downtime
3) My neighborhood mailman always parks her truck at the bottom of the hill and hikes up to get exercise = way more time for delivery


The first two of these issues are solved with WKHS. WKHS EV will reduce mpg cost (duh) but their final mile drone delivery and automated solutions will reduce the need for more stops and increase productivity chain. Seriously, look up the Workhorse Horsefly. The third issue I will not argue and fully support her getting in better shape.

With all this being said its obvious that I feel that WKHS is the obvious choice, but who knows what the board of governors is thinking. Below are the 4 scenarios for end game that a user came up with on tradingview but they are pretty standard:

Scenario One: 40% chance: WKHS earns the entire contract. Someone else did the math of the fair stock price after adjusting for the additional billions of dollars WKHS would have from winning the contract and they came out with $172 per share right after the contract was announced.

Scenario Two: 30% change: The contract is split up between Oskosh and WorkHorse. In the initial documentation before Biden's 100% green energy plans, the USPS wanted 75% electric 25% gas vehicles so it is possible workhorse gets 75% and Oskosh gets 25%. Others on the internet claim that it will be all or nothing but if you check the actual agreement it gives room for a split which the government does all the time. Even with only 10% of the contract awarded to WKHS you can expect to see the stock break past $60 the very next day.

Scenario Three: 20% chance: They cant come to a decision and push it back until next quarter. This has happened already two times. They were first supposed to decide this summer, but they pushed it back to December. In December they failed again and pushed it back to latest March 31st. If this happens, the pullback to about $20 is super likely or at least holding the lower fibonacci retracement.

Scenario Four: 10% chance: OSK wins the contract. Oskosh is an awesome company, they have a very positive relationship with the government selling us Humvees for the military. They are respected and reliable, however they submitted a fossil fuel powered prototype and due to contract law can't just resubmit something else at the last minute. Especially with Biden wanting to look like he can get shit done AND after having made a statement about electrifying the US Fleet it looks insanely unlikely that OSK gets the entire bid, but if this happens, the only support that won't get destroyed the very next day is at the $16 level.

TLDR: WKHS should win the USPS contract and their short term viability relies on it.

My positions: 600 shares at $34 cost basis, $32C LEAPs 1/2022, $32Cs at 2/12, 2/19, 3/19
Total position is worth around 30,000 right now and about 40% of my single-registered.

Title: $UBS ready to rip
$UBS 17.5c 3/19 relatively low float stock with cheap premiums and lots of call option volume. 

Here is some DD Ive collected

**UBS joint venture deal:** https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-09/ubs-joint-venture-reaches-deal-with-banco-patagonia-in-argentina

**UBS looks to double workforce:** https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-10/ubs-looks-to-double-workforce-in-booming-private-credit-unit

**the big one:** https://www.fa-mag.com/news/-6-5b-j-p--morgan-team-joins-ubs-wealth-management-in-l-a-60277.html

Aside from these great pieces of news, UBS [call option volume](https://imgur.com/gallery/JMq5TD9) increased greatly. Premiums are still the same price though. Meaning its not to late to hop on the train. 

With a relatively low float stock like this. This can go flying if buy volume increases.

I personally have 17.5c for 3/19 because Its the best value at only $0.13 and I like this stock

If you guys are with the movement feel free to post about it and upvote to spread the word 

EDIT: btw this is not financial advice nor a pump, this is strictly theoretical and otherwise just a good company with some great news coming out.

Title: Why Rite Aid is RAD not BAD (anymore)
Welcome back to another Rite aid (RAD) shitpost.  Im back as my prediction has been correct so far, and I only expect this trend to continue. Up 300% so far.  It is still incredibly EARLY for reasons I will explain.  



**RITE AID (RAD)**

Okay I know, your app is showing you it was .50 a year ago and youre saying fuck idk about this one, it looks like I missed it.  Its okay though, robbingyouhood is just lying again.  The truth is that rite aid had a 1:20 **reverse stock split** artificially X 20 the price.

**WHAT DOES THIS MEAN**

It means we can assume two things, rite aid has only doubled in price since its mediocre deal with Walgreens fell through.  

In 2016 Rite Aid had 4561 stores with a stock price of 160~ (adjusted for split) and a market cap of 8 billion dollars.  

In 2020 Rite Aid has 2500 stores with a stock price of 25~ and a market cap of 1.5 billion.

Yet if we look here https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/RAD/rite-aid/revenue

Rite aid revenue has actually INCREASED over the past five years and is at 75% of its highest point.  


They have trimmed the fat and beat earnings the last three quarters.

Rite aid has a pretty optimistic balance sheet for a company that has been rebranding and restructuring.  Notably we can see they are sitting on 6 Billion in assets and are seeing 21 Billion Revenue with 12% growth this past quarter (over 25% this year)

Rite aid is becoming closer and closer to becoming consistently profitable once again as they are able to take advantage of coronavirus tax relief.  They are seeing increased foot traffic in their pharmacy and front end leading to this huge growth.  

Walgreens has 30x the market cap and 4x the revenue while CVS has 70x the market cap and 10x the revenue.  Neither are seeing the growth that rite aid is.  


**WHAT DO I DO**

I am very bullish on rite aid.  I am still holding shares and have adjusted my calls to 3-19 $30 and 4-16 $35 a handful of 2022 40$ as well.  

I have a price target or 50$ which I think is attainable by April. 

Tl;dr: Rite aid was shorted to shit and saved itself with a 1:20 reverse split.  As a result its STILL fundamentally undervalued.  Read last paragraph for plays.  

My earlier posts were earlier warnings but Im yoloing today I think itll start to run up again as vaccine distribution ramps up.

Title: Why APHA is an Alpha Trade in the Short and Long-run (Actual DD)
Tl;dr: I'm willing to bet all of you degenerates smoke weed and drive to your wife's boyfriend's house every Saturday night. Then, the munchies kick in full force and you got to a Wendy's parking lot and jack off to a video of your wife flipping you off while riding a dong as least eight times longer than your 5 dollar inch long. There is a fucking bubble and you should get in. And it's a good long-term investment, so you should get in (none of this is financial advice, this is just me talking to myself in Reddit after taking anti-depressants from holding Gamestop).

&amp;#x200B;

**Reason 1:** Everyone's a bull. The pigs and bears are dead because there's more money than what financial institutions know what to do with.

Remember SPY puts? Remember printer goes brrrrrr? Remember how monetary policy produced some of the greatest loss porn we've ever seen. Gay bears is kill and the government has proven that they will probably prop up the financial system even if bubonic plague 2.0 happens. That money is still floating around with the Fed's finger on the trigger prepared to smack the equity markets back up. That money was invested into stocks like TSLA (which is the most beautiful and terrifying bubble I've seen in my life). That money will also make weed stocks as high as a kite. Discounted cash flows, betas, stock/bond conflicts, and all that other stuff is irrelevant. Monetary policy is fundamental and will always save those who have money.

This is the new reality we live with. Like it or buy some guns, ammunition, and a lifetime worth of soylent and beyond meat and start your own 1 person country in the backass of nowhere.

There will be a bubble and it will pop. Do not be concerned about the pop until it appears imminent. And even if it does, I would still consider holding it for a delicious long play.

**Reason 2:** APHA's balance sheet is robust. Doesn't show any signs of collapsing financially. Longevity in a new industry is golden.

[https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/apha/financials](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/apha/financials)

Instead of getting high on their own supply when their stock soared as high as a kite, the comedown was harsh. But instead of getting rekt, they have been expanding rapidly regardless. Their sales have increased 142.34% in 2017, 80.62% in 2018, **542.28%** in 2019, and 128.73% in 2020. And considering that everyone's spending their stimulus money smoking weed and buying Gamestop, I do not see this trend stopping at any point. I've been to my local weed shop in CA and it's fucking packed every time I go in both pick ups and lines. I have to wait at least 45 minutes to get in.

Even though the net income is concerning (it usually is for companies that grow rapidly due to the costs of expanding like a chad), the firm has a really large pillow to fall on. To be clear, for a company to be totally dead in the water, its equity (the difference between its assets and liabilities) goes to zero. APHA has 2.5 billion in assets and .7125 mil in liabilities. This is perhaps one of the reasons it gobbled up Tilray-- APHA recognizes it can increase its market share in an inevitable market place. This means that the company can continue its rapid expansion without worrying about defaulting. For reference, Amazon could afford to lose hundreds of millions of dollars from 2012-2015 because it has the assets to afford rapid expansion. We are looking at a potential hundred billion dollar company here as the marijuana industry consolidates into a few major players. APHA is likely to be one of those, as it has the durability and fundamentals to survive years of consecutive negative net income. APHA's largest expenses are "unusual expenses," implying that they are really swinging for the fences with many one-time expansive purchases. 

**Reason 3:** Because of BLM and a decade of rising sentiment against the war on drugs, enforcing weed possession and sales laws are politically dangerous.

Yup. Nixon's law and order paradigm is falling out of the sky. Busting into people's apartments for a gram of weed and sentencing the occupants to 9 years in prison is not too popular. Even if marijuana legalization doesn't happen this or next or whatever, the tide has overwhelming turned against a "tough on crime" attitude toward non-violent drug use. This means that across the United States (and likely the world over the next decade or so), **weed will be effectively legal** over time even if it's not truly legal.

Position: 40 shares of APHA high as a motherfucking kite.

Title: Amazon Doubles Down on Grocery
Amazon is aggressively investing in the retail grocery business with the goal of operating 2,000 retail stores in the US blended between Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh. And so far they are killing it!

There are currently 500 Whole Foods stores and 8 Amazon Fresh stores in the US. Over 30 Whole Foods and 27 Amazon Fresh stores are currently in development.

Amazon recently opened the doors to its newest Amazon Fresh in Northridge, California. While the store marks the banners third location in SoCal (joining [Woodland Hills](https://www.winsightgrocerybusiness.com/retailers/how-amazon-fresh-won-my-business) and [Irvine](https://www.winsightgrocerybusiness.com/retailers/will-amazon-fresh-crush-it-california)), dozens of additional stores in various stages of development are also underway in the area. According to Planned Grocery, additional SoCal stores are planned or under construction in Poway, Whittier, Fullerton, Long Beach, La Verne and Encino. Additionally, four locations in the Chicago area are slated to open soon.

Amazon seems to be putting the pedal to the metal with its grocery expansion plans, R-5 Capital Analyst Scott Mushkin wrote. In our view, it is hard not to see the recent partnership between Amazon and SpartanNash as a sign that Amazon intends to grow its store fleet rapidly over the next few years, Mushkin said. According to the 2021 dunnhumby Retailer Preference Index, Amazon eclipsed top grocery retailers H-E-B and Trader Joes due to Speed, Digital and strong Price and Quality.

H-E-B and Trader Joes are terrific brands, yet Amazons unmatched convenience is addictive, wrote Ms. Goller. The dunnhumby stats prove consumers crave prompt home delivery, a trend that will outlast the pandemic. Even when life resumes, Just Walk Out technology at Amazon Go and rivals stores will set new brick-and-mortar standards for convenience, ease and time savings. Also, I expect Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh will continue to expand nationwide when the time is right. Amazons hungry to win and its grocery party is just getting started.

During United Natural Foods' recent earnings call, CEO Steven Spinner expects to renew its Whole Foods contract in early 2021. From their recent 10K filling, "We have been the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market for more than twenty years. Under the terms of our agreement with Whole Foods Market, we serve as the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market in all of its regions in the United States. Our agreement with Whole Foods Market expires on September 28, 2025. Whole Foods Market is our only customer that represented more than 10% of total net sales in fiscal 2020." Whole Foods accounted for approximately 18% of UNFI's net sales in fiscal 2020.

During Amazon's recent earnings call, Dave Fildes, director ofinvestor relations, said the Amazon Go Grocery format was off to a good start, adding there was a lot of interest in the technology behind it and Amazon Fresh grocery stores.

Given the investments Amazon has made in the grocery business and the significant positive response thus far favorably positions Amazon and other grocery suppliers such as United Natural Foods (UNFI).

Title: DD: Cinemark ($CNK)  Clear Standout in Moon Stock Screen
First time poster, longtime tard. GME was too beautiful to remain a passive reader. Sure, lob your HF shill comments (bring it retards) but then hear me out if you like $$$$ (cant be sure with half you guys)

The perfect stock has been right in front of your eyes and its so obvious it hurts. AMCs ugly sister, CNK, is strapped to an Elon Musk rocket and is just begging for someone to press the big shiny launch button.

This is a rare one-two punch where both the technical &amp; fundamental pictures look great.

**Punchline Upfront:** CNK currently trades at $20. CNK has upside to $40. These are levels at which it traded only 18 months ago. In fact, CNK traded in a $10 range between $32 and $42 in 2019 with an average price of $37.80

# Technical: The Ice Cream (The Tendie?)

OK Why CNK? Simple: I ran a Moon Screen which looked for:

1. **High Short Interest** (&gt;20% of floatable shares outstanding)
2. **Cheap Stock** (Hasnt Had A GME moment, low 1 year return, fundamentals etc.)
3. **Small company** with lower trading volume (both mean more upside)
4. **Liquid** (i.e. a lot) **call options** (fuck puts) to minimize trading costs (i.e. maximize tendies)

and CNK got spit out as the clear standout. If this feels familiar, its because most of these criteria were based off GME before Cohen was announced to the board. Thats right: I simply want to acknowledge the salivating technical set up and its similarity to GME pre-orbit.

# Fundamental: The Cherry on Top (The Tendie Sauce?)

COVID has changed the world in lasting, meaningful ways and CNKs theatre footprint is uniquely positioned to benefit from these changes. Pent-up demand for out-of-home entertainment combined with a backlog of strong film content creates a strong backdrop for Cinemark.

&amp;#x200B;

# Reason 1: Suburban + Lower-Income Tilt Will Outperform in Post-COVID World

* TL;DR: Suburban Footprint = Actually Really Fucking Good (For Many Reasons)

Cinemarks theatre footprint is slated toward suburban locations. Dont take my word for it, here is their COO/CFO Sean Gamble (really his name lol): \[CNK\] tends to be more suburban, while \[AMCs\] circuit tends to be a bit more metro. **This is what gets me excited.** While we still dont fully know the extent COVID had on people living in dense, urban areas like NYC, the preliminary read is that it has accelerated the move to the suburbs. This helps CNK for two reasons:

1. Suburban locations have lower rent
2. Suburban locations stand to benefit from higher demand based off people moving to the suburbs

Just think for a second. On average, suburbs have less fun shit to do. Although going to the movies might not sound that exciting in a city given all the great alternatives, going to the movies might be the only game in town in suburbia

In addition, Cinemark operates primarily in smaller cities and suburban areas, meaning lower-income where customers are more price-sensitive. Cinemarks customer base also has a higher share of families than AMC/Regal. This also helps CNK:

1. More price sensitive customers =&gt; less ability to create a compelling movie experience at home =&gt; more likely to continue going to the theater

# Reason 2: Better Balance Sheet =&gt; Longer Runway to Weather COVID Storm

* TL;DR: Lots Money + Low Debt + Low Rent = I Can Wait Out COVID

Strong balance sheet (850mm in cash sitting there; low leverage of 2x-3x vs. AMC at 8.5x).

Industry-leading Operations with FAT margins (23-26% domestic margins; 8.6% fatter (i.e. good, fat margin = fat tendie) than AMC)

Low rent obligations. New/updated theaters. Nice operational runway to weather the COVID storm.

# Reason 3: Boost From Dollar Weakness

25% of revs from Latin America. Huge FX headwind here if dollar depreciates (which many people think)

&amp;#x200B;

**Valuation/\*Nerd Shit\*:**

* Has traded historically at 6.5-8.5x fwd EBITDA. Conservatively, take low end of range due to sentiment around streaming killing box office sales despite still trading at 8.5x as recently as a few years ago
* Full-year 2021 revs will be -50% but by 2022, revs should be back to 2019 (pre-COVID) levels. So, using 2022 lvls is the right forward base to value this thing.
* EBITDA was \~750mm in 2019. 50mm haircut for potential covid hiccups puts me at700mm estimate for 2022 (again, the first normal year given 2021 is already off to shit start). Taking the low-end of the valuation multiple, 6.5x, gives me a price of $38.50 (after dividing by shares outstanding)

**Target Price: $38.50**

&amp;#x200B;

**Afterthought  Takeout Upside:**

* Streaming service (AMZN, NFLX, DIS) bundling subscriptions with theatre access might serve as a competitive differentiator as the content wars get increasingly competitive as nearly a dozen streaming services compete for market share. Might snatching up a cinema on the cheap offer an edge via a differentiated experience tack on?
* Just as restaurants wont go away despite everyone having a kitchen, theatres could still have a role, although a changed one that will have to become experience-first, movie-second
* As long as dates (esp. highschool !) and nights out still happen, having an extra avenue to watch movies besides your couch will still have some demand
* A physical footprint for AMZN to test VR and reinforce other e-commerce services

&amp;#x200B;

**Notes/Links:**

**Sean Gamble** \- *Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer*

&gt;"And in terms of our overlap, it really varies based on the market and just what you consider overlap based on distance. In general, it's pretty small, I would say, estimate less than 20%. You just consider our market shares, that can kind of show that it's only a small portion in. **We generally tend to be more suburban, while their circuit tends to be a bit more metro**. So it's a limited overlap."

Title: $AUY is a Gold Mine (Both Figuratively and Literally)
Hello Fellow Retards,

I come to you with news from a boomers favorite form of currency: gold. More specifically, a mining company, Yamana Gold. They have earnings tomorrow on the 11th, and based on their previous guidance, they are going to post very strong earnings. Although I hold shares (yeah yeah I know), options are dirt cheap with such low IV. I want to present a case for the company as I believe they have a great year ahead of them.

Now I know gold is down in the past few months, but it still remains as strong as its ever been, and Yamana Gold (ticker $AUY) has been absolutely benefiting from the high prices. With the Feds keeping lending rates low through 2023 and supporting this vision with monthly Treasury bond purchases, this can push down long-term yields. Add this onto the ongoing fiscal stimulus and a steadily increasing money supply, there are many reasons for investors to choose gold in the coming years.

On top of high gold/silver prices, Yamana is looking at a nice increase in production from their Canadian Malartic mine in 2021, and is expected to benefit from higher output at the newer Cerro Moro mine. Yamana is pushing to deeper underground levels at Cerro Moro, which will lead to improved yield and production potential. Yamana's management expects to [produce at least 1 million gold equivalent ounces](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/02/3-value-stocks-thatll-make-you-richer-in-february/) (GEO) in each of the next three years.

With gold prices up significantly over the past five years, Yamana has also been able to [reduce its net debt](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/29/should-you-buy-gold-stocks-right-now.aspx) by over $1 billion, and increase their annual dividend 425% over 18 months. In a few more quarters at this 1 million GEO annual target, and it just might become net-cash positive.

Positions: 200 shares @ $4.92 and 2/19 $5C.

Title: Teva Pharma
Well, If anyone listened to my last post about ACB and bought some OTM FDs you'd be up a cool 500% if you sold this morning, so figured give this another shot.  

With 2.1billion in positive cash flow Teva has committed to making these changes by 2030 

Specifically, the company has committed by 2030 to:

* Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 33% versus 2017 levels to support efforts to limit the global temperature increase to well below 2C, aligning with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.
* Improve transparency of Scope 3 GHG emissions and increase engagement on climate issues with key suppliers throughout the value chain.
* Increase energy efficiency by 10% and the total proportion of energy purchased or generated from renewable sources to 50%.
* Reduce total water withdrawal by 10% in areas projected to be in water stress.
* Assess and mitigate the environmental impact of pharmaceutical ingredients used in operations.
* Reduce the overall mass of secondary and tertiary packaging materials per unit dose and increase the proportion of recycled and responsibly-sourced materials by 10%.
* Assess the environmental lifecycle impact of key products.
* Continue to minimize waste generated from operations and the environmental impact of its disposal.
* Meet existing AMR Industry Alliance commitments to minimize antimicrobial discharges from the supply chain.  

That sounds pretty fuckin green, aka one stock to own during the Biden presidency.

&amp;#x200B;

Also lets look at some projections for next year

 2021 business outlook:

* Revenues are expected to be $16.4 - $16.8 billion (2020 actual results include \~$240 million in revenues from generic products in Japan divested on February 1, 2021, along with a manufacturing site)
* Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $2.50 - $2.70
* Free cash flow is expected to be $2.0 - $2.3 billion

Someone wanna explain to me how a company projected to do 16 Billion plus in revenue still only have a market cap of 12 billion? Simple it's underpriced. 

Current position

20 Long calls 9/17/21 $15

I wanted to add more info/ will probably add more thorough dd, currently at work.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR  $TEVA is a good long term play.

Also they're in talks to co-produce a covid vaccine aka $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-teva-pharm-ind-covid-exclusive/exclusive-teva-pharm-in-talks-to-co-produce-covid-19-vaccines-ceo-says-idUSKBN2AA20D](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-teva-pharm-ind-covid-exclusive/exclusive-teva-pharm-in-talks-to-co-produce-covid-19-vaccines-ceo-says-idUSKBN2AA20D)

Im not sure if anyone ever kept of with Novavax but they're sitting at a cool $300

Title: Robinhood is making millions off your trailing stop orders (data n stuff)
reposting this as it's more relevant than ever to gtfo of Robinhood. 

Robinhood made $90m in Q1 2020 off non-marketable limit orders. More-so than any one **single** entity while being a much smaller company in terms of overall flow.

&gt;**Is Robinhood incentivized to send orders to one market maker over another?**  
No. To ensure we have a fair system, we dont take rebates into consideration when we choose which market maker will execute your orders. Also, all market makers with whom we have relationships pay us rebates at the same rate.

Doesn't seem true but I could be wrong.

As well as their [associated SEC Rule 606 data](https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606A%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q1%202020.pdf)

tldr; your trailing stops don't trigger as fast as you'd like them to because they make a shit load off the bid-ask spread. As well as seemingly getting a sweetheart deal on S&amp;P500 spread. Market liquidity isn't your friend when you're commission free trading.

autist tldr; using trailing stops on robinhood is like tongue punching your sister's fart box.

Title: Ford Motors (F) DD
**Overview**

Ford Motors is currently undervalued ($45B) after an underperforming Q4 but is taking the right steps to compete in the electric and autonomous vehicle markets going forward.

**Reasons**

* Ford is already in an upward trend the past 30 days. This week they just released news of their **$29 Billion** (with a 'B') investment into their electric and autonomous vehicles department  ([link](https://www.motortrend.com/news/ford-ev-investment-2025/)) surpassing that of General Motors.
* Ford now has it's first credible mass-market competition to Tesla in the [2021 Mustang Mach-E electric crossover SUV](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/mustang-mach-e/) which goes on sale later this year.
* Ford is bringing the real 'merica to electric trucks (sorry Elon) with it's upcoming [F-150 full-size truck](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/f-150/2021/2021-ford-f-150-first-look-review/) in mid-2022.
* Rivian, backed by Ford and Amazon, looking to IPO this year ([link](https://www.chicagobusiness.com/manufacturing/rivian-backed-amazon-and-ford-aims-ipo-year))
* Ford in the running to be Post Office's next delivery vehicle ([link](https://fordauthority.com/2020/12/ford-transit-in-running-to-become-post-offices-next-delivery-vehicle/))
* The **new Ford Bronco release date** is spring 2021. ([link](https://www.ford.com/bronco/))
* Tesla is in trouble with Chinese regulators and other companies are ready to take up some market share.
* Even if you don't buy options and are just a share investor, Ford Motors has a respectable 1.30 Dividend Yield.
* And if you don't believe me an actual (non-monkey) analyst has already said it would be going up to $14 ([link](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ford-upgraded-to-buy-at-argus-with-a-price-target-that-matches-the-street-high-2021-02-09)).

**Speculation**

With Tesla leading the market in electric vehicles, America needs competition to take place. Who better than one of the oldest vehicle manufacturers? Ford knows trucks, which will be a big part of the upcoming electric market. How many times have you heard two bro's start arguing about trucks and inevitably one of them is always a Ford?!? The stock is ripe for the taking and if you want to get some tendies, you should get in now.

**TLDR**; Ford is 'merica. 'Merica needs electric trucks. Go buy Ford.

Title: THE REAL STEEL PLAY $EAF $30 EOY   
This is my most and only in-depth DD, which I spent hours(literal) researching, enjoy:   
NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE DO YOUR OWN DD

**Preface: Understanding The Steel Industry:**  
If you have been on this sub since last year, you will have heard about steel prices rising and $MT, $VALE, all that jazz, I am not going to regurgitate any info, **I NEED TO STRESS THOUGH, THIS IS NOT A STEEL MINER STOCK.** We all know the saying:" during a **gold rush**, **sell shovels** ", well Graftech sells the steel equivalent of shovels, **GRAPHITE ELECTRODES**. Let me explain: there are two ways to produce steel, the blast furnace method using iron ore, and the electric arc furnace (EAF) method using scrap metal. Graphite electrodes are the ONLY material that can be used for EAF production as they can withstand the heat as well as conduct enough electric current. In addition, EAF also require [petroleum needle cokes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_coke) Now that you understand all this, we can move on.

**EAF As an industry, and how Graftech fits in:**

First, let's take a look at EAF as an industry. The EAF industry, or more specifically the production of cokes and electrodes, has an extremely high barrier to entry. It is extremely capital intensive to build and maintain a factory, requiring immense technical knowledge and time. So much so that **ONLY 1**, new graphite electrode facility has been built outside of China since the 1980s. This means that our steel play $EAF is protected with an extremely high moat. This has resulted in the largest 5 graphite electrode manufacturers producing 82% of all electrodes, and Graftech is one of the 5 producing 25%. Also it is only 1 of 2 companies that are public. Moving on to needle cokes, which let me remind you are just as important, Graftech is the **ONLY** company that produces them as well. Seadrift, the second-largest coke producer is owned by Graftech. This makes Graftech the **ONLY** vertically integrated coke and electrode manufacturers in the world. This is immensely important because vertical integration leads to higher profit margins and thus more profit. Additionally, this industry is set to double by 2027 to 

**Steel industry as a whole: China and Biden**

China is one of the worlds largest steel manufacturers producing over half of all steel according to the world steel association. The cool thing is, China is mostly a blast furnace based manufacturer, with only 12% of steel being made by EAFs.

This is amazing because china is making the shift towards EAF manufacturing leaving alot of room for growth. And as I said before, EAFs use scrap metal to make steel. [Guess who is slowly importing more and more scrap from other countries?](https://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3974480/China-adds-South-Korea-Singapore-to-growing-pool-of-scrap-suppliers-prices-rise.html) 

Next lets talk about Biden, this will be short and straightforward. Biden is going to introduce many new infrastructure plans mainly as a push to green energy. It really doesn't matter what kind of things Biden wants to build, as long as its made out of steel. [Here](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/) are his infrastructure plans, you cant read it up if you want but I think you get the gist. 

**Graftech Fundamentals:**

Finally lets take a look at fundamentals. These are incredibly good, but even if they were not it wouldn't matter, the macro driven reasons I mentioned before are sufficient to send this stock to the moon. We have a P/S of 2.4 and P/E 7.07, making the company undervalued, as most stocks trade around 20 PE and 10P/S. They have upped their R&amp;D expenditure from 650k Q3 to 1.9M in Q4. This is phenomenal as it shows they are reinvesting their revenue, and as I mentioned before this industry is heavily reliant on technical knowledge. The only glaring issue I see from a fundamental standpoint is some debt of 1.76B, but I am not worried as it is long term debt and their short term debt is only 71M.

**Cherry On Top:**

Here are some minor things that could lead somewhere, but are no the main focus of my thesis. Graphite has heavy usage in the electronics industry, mainly batteries. This means EAF could potentially provide graphite to any battery company like $PLUG and $TESLA. In fact graphite electrodes are a component in EV batteries, and hydrogen fuel cells use graphite. There may be some other things I missed but this is pretty much it. 

**TLDR: BUY $EAF LITERALLY EVERYTHING IS GOING IN ITS FAVOR**

Positions: $EAF $15 Calls, 16 Apr 21

Title: GME Options Manipulation. Why you want it under 50 EOW.
Do whatever the fuck you want with your GME bags, but I wanted to share this. It was reported yesterday that GME has a LOT of option activity. In particular, the 2/12 50$ strike put makes up the majority of these (which should tell you the position is bearish, but I digress.)

SOURCE: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-tuesday-option-activity%253A-ups-five-gme-2021-02-09%3famp


What it means: the game now for the bad guys is keeping GME above 50 so these puts expire worthless and they dont end up holding your bags themselves. Youll see it trade sideways with retard strength until Friday and magically see it hit 50.01 at close because these are market manipulating fuckheads. Then it will continue to bleed the next week.

If you really wanna fuck these guys over, then at least make GME finish under 50 to end the week. Who knows, maybe that triggers some sort of activity...

Disclosure: I do not own 50 2/12 puts but did make money off GME puts this last week. Not a bot. Not a shill. Am retard.

Title: $BB DD thread: Why this retard believes the fair market value for $BB is $45. Obligatory 
I'm not a financial advisor, just a retard YOLO'ing my savings into long calls, so make your own decisions.

TLDR: Blackberry is the market leader in an industry that McKinsey projects will fucking  to $750BN by 2030. BlackBerry has already grown their annual revenue for 2020 by 15.04% from 2019, so stap in your tendies because BB are going to the fucking moon.

1) BB has nothing to do with smartphones. Throw those 2007 notions out of your mind and bring yourself to the future

2) Whilst the whole stock market has been pissing themselves for years over EV/AV industry speculation, the reality is that these are hardware companies with low margin, and limited scale potential.

Even Tesla, owned and run by the richest man in the world, has yet to build more than 500,000 cars in one year. Meanwhile Tesla competitors springing up everywhere with both new challengers such as NIO and old money fucks getting into EV such as VW and GM (GM in December 2020 announced 100% by 2030 all cars would be 100% EV).

THE REAL FUCKING MONEY is not in EV production which has low margin and low scale, but in data monetization which is high margin (and being software) has unlimited scale. In the same way that Google makes only $18Bn revenue from hardware sales (phone, nest sales etc) but makes $120Bn from data monetization, $BB is going to to the fucking moon with $200BN revenue + by 2030 with 10% net whilst Tesla and other big auto are fighting over 4% margins (Tesla net profit in 2020 = 4% whilst **BB sat at a juicy 10.15%**).

This industry is going to the fucking moon, and BB is the only one with a front row ticket . This shit is like investing in Google or Amazon in the year 2000, by the time the mainstream saw the potential 5 years later, shit was already at pluto

u/just an everyday life couldn't have put it better: "Zombie cars and QNX

QNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. What the fuck does that even mean nerd? For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.

Blackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn't develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.

Fast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot program but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?

SONY? Blackberry QNX. Baidu? QNX baby. XPENG? Blackberry as well. If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? Li Auto But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using Nvidia DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both Canoo and Hyundai makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.

You might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moon"

3) BB is a cash flow positive, growing company with near nil competitors in an industry that is skyrocketing. Despite this, the boomer fucks who still believe BB is a smartphone company, have in their own glorious act of autism, have massively shorted BB bringing the share price down. 

BB is a growth company in a growth industry, these hedge funds are going to need to borrow more money if they want to buy tendies after the wider market realizes the market inefficiency that is an undervalued BB. u/Tradergurue went into a lot of detail in his $BB short interest post here [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short\_interest\_in\_bb\_its\_increasing/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short_interest_in_bb_its_increasing/) 

TLDR: hedge funds caught with their dicks in their hands are about to get Royally Fucked as the market corrects itself with a BB rise over the next month

Title: $GME LEAP risk adjusted valuation
So you want to bet on GME and use LEAPs to levarage your bankroll? Well not only WSB likes to trade options and there's a lot of literature about the valuation of options based on some key indicators. I've listed the value of different options adjusted for risk down below so you might find some options which are comparably overvalued or undervalued. Since the demand for GME options is incredibly high, especially far OTM calls, the real prices will probably all be way above the risk adjusted valuation.

I've had to take some assumptions into account when calculating these:
- Dividend rate on GME is zero
- Risk free interest is at 0.1%
- IV of 139.4% on the '22 call, 108.6% on the '23 call (those are the IVs on IBKR right now)
- Spot price is at 49.00$ right now so I used that

With these assumptions in mind here are the tables with strike prices and their valuation, enjoy!

Title: GME Bullish thesis
1. New Short interest data is here, 78.46% potentially higher so we Short Squeeze is still possible
2. Institutional ownership is over 200% meaning it'll be very difficult to cover short positions
3. Earnings on 3/25: are sure to beat expectations might be the first profitable earnings might cause a short squeeze if it didn't already happen by then.
4. Price seems to bottom at 50
5. RSI is at 33 on the 1 hour chart meaning it's oversold and is due for an upward correction
6. MACD convergence is happening within the coming days meaning a potential reversal could happen

Conclusion: GME should could start a reversal soon, short term price volatility might lead to a price of 40-50 before a reversal to 100+ by next month the resulting momentum could easily start a new round of buying and another short squeeze but right now it's just a waiting game of who can last longer so hold the line and be patient the tendies will come.

Title: Cresco Labs ($CRLBF) - Why I like this weed stock
TL:DR at the bottom. Not financial advice.

With weed stocks gaining momentum, I thought I share one which I believe is undervalued vs other key players. Cresco currently operates in 9 US states.

This analysis will focus on what I believe are the three most important factors for cannabis - Revenue, Revenue Growth, Liquidity.

Revenue - Cresco vs 5 key players

Cresco Labs: 355M Revenue ; Market Cap 3.5B
Canopy Growth: 477M Revenue ; Market Cap 18.3B
Curaleaf: 472M Revenue ; Market Cap 11.6B
Cronos: 37M Revenue ; Market Cap 4.8B
Tilray*: 201M Revenue ; Market Cap 6.7B
Aurora: 273M Revenue ; Market Cap 3.1B
If we look purely at revenue, only Aurora appears to have a similar market pricing to Cresco, with a Mkt Cap/Revenue ratio of 11 vs Mkt Cap/Revenue ratio of 10 for Cresco. The 4 other stocks vary from a ratio of 24 to 133.

This means purely on revenue, Cresco could be considered to be undervalued vs other key weed stocks.

Revenue Growth TTM vs 2019 - Vs 5 key players

Cresco Labs: 175% Growth
Canopy Growth: 111% Growth
Curaleaf: 114% Growth
Cronos: 54% Growth
Tilray*: 20% Growth
Aurora: 10% Growth
Cresco has by far the highest revenue growth ratio. And this is just looking at ttm vs 2019 as Cresco have their 2020 fiscal calendar report in April. This means on top of these figures, some of these companies would have had more time to grow revenue vs their fiscal calendar 2019 due to differing fiscal calendars.

Liquidity

Below I'm only looking at current ratio and quick ratio. The higher the ratio, the better.

Cresco Labs: 1.06 / 0.53
Canopy Growth: 6.09 / 5.16
Curaleaf: 1.42 / 0.64
Cronos: 4.73 / 4.62
Tilray*: 2.82 / 1.86
Aurora: 1.54 / 0.97
Cresco has a lower market cap as it is a possibility it does go bankrupt this year if things turn for the worse. However Cresco has a positive EBITDA in their last earnings report and if it does get an injection of cash/stronger results than expected, there is massive room to grow to reach the same value as other companies in the same category.

One of the things that is holding it back is that you can only trade the stock on OTC markets or the Canadian exchange. If it does enter a major US exchange, I can see it go big.

Just like every other weed stock, this stock has growth plans with new dispensaries in yada yada, will have better productivity due to yada yada, increases cultivation by xxx% in yada yada due to yada yada space, and has a new Chief Commercial Officer who has great experience in CG in companies such as yada, yada yada, and yabbadabbadoo. Do your own research, all weed stocks have something new and exciting like this one.

Trades as $CRLBF or CAD$CL.CN. I have 120 shares.

TL:DR: Dude weed lmao

Title: Naked shorting in GME and how the pieces suddenly fit together
 **MODS DONT DELETE THIS, REPOSTED FROM REDDIT ARCHIVE, I CAN'T SEE OP USERNAME BUT KEEP REPOSTING. IF THIS GETS DELETED THERE IS SOME CORRUPT SHIT GOING ON IN THIS SUB.**

TLDR: Hard to distill it into TLDR but essentially a lot of pieces clicking together if you believe there was naked shorting in GME (and there is strong evidence to support that theory). I know ape can't read but I implore you to read the whole thing

I was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME. I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes. This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle, I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now:

One of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226%, and later in the range of 150% percent of total float. Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://web.archive.org/web/20210210061947/https://wherearetheshares.com/)). Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal. In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist (there are many analysis and data points pointing to this but just one example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme\_institutions\_hold\_177\_of\_float\_why\_the/](https://web.archive.org/web/20210210061947/https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/)). Where do these shares come from? One potential explanation is synthetic long shares (created via a loophole described here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://web.archive.org/web/20210210061947/https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting.

Im an entrepreneur, not a finance expert, so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject. I started with this [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/20210210061947/https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm). Failures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale. There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver. For example, human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book-entry form, thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three-day settlement period. **A fail may also result from naked short selling**.

Interesting. We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond, an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time.

According to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox, Abusive **naked short sales... can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price** to the detriment of all of its investors. The Commission is particularly concerned about **persistent failures to deliver in the market** for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO, adopted just two years ago Selling short without having stock available for delivery, and **intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three-day settlement period, is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws** We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that **substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities.** Specifically, these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership - voting, lending, and dividends from issuers. Moreover, **they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price**.

In a different speech Mr Cox re-iterated that short selling helps prevent "irrational exuberance" and bubbles. But **when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market  it is undermining it.** Mr Cox also referred to "the serious problem of abusive naked short sales as **a tool to drive down a company's stock price**" and that the SEC is "concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to **loopholes in Regulation SHO**" (which reminds me of this piece I wrote [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://web.archive.org/web/20210210061947/https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) (source for SEC Chairmans words: [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/20210210061947/https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm))

As another datapoint, Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that **naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground**. (Source: This was originally in a time magazine article from 2005 which was deleted[ https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20210210061947/https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html) but the statement still exists in record in an SEC Filing from 2008[ https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/20210210061947/https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm))

I also read **One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares** for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create "**phantom" or "counterfeit" shares**, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and **artificially depressing the share price**. Shortly after, I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers. Taibbi said that the two firms got a "push" into extinction from "a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling". (Source:[ https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall\_streets\_naked\_swindle](https://web.archive.org/web/20210210061947/https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall_streets_naked_swindle))

All these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted, which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed. If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage, GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen -- potentially even an infinite short squeeze. On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB. The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze, the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze.

On 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre-trading started (the stock shot up to 513 in pre-trading) and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day, the momentum was suddenly shut down when Robinhood (where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on) were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling, followed by several other brokers. Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying (but funds were not.) When this happened people were upset at Robinhood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between Robinhood and Citadel (which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2.5 billion to Melvin Capital, one of the short side funds, and is also responsible for something like 40% of Robinhoods entire revenue by buying their order books), but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself. Now, personally speaking, its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this. However, looking into the details of what happened, a skeptical part of me became suspicious.

Apparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to Robinhood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars ([https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/](https://web.archive.org/web/20210210061947/https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/)) . So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening. On that day, there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen. Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond (which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze), hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag. Worse, DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing, I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least.

Then I read something that caught my eye DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts. From an article dating back to 2007, Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp. is a little-known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers. About 99% of the time, trades are completed without incident. But about 1% of the shares -- valued at about $2.5 billion on a given a day -- aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days, for one reason or another. **These "failures to deliver" have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices**. (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://web.archive.org/web/20210210061947/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

Apparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time. According to Wall Street Journal **There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens. The fight is over how prevalent the problem is -- and the extent to which DTCC is responsible**. Some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens. DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern. (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://web.archive.org/web/20210210061947/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720)).

As a thought experiment, lets say naked shorting is rampant in GME (many many indicators point to this) and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on GME, wouldnt it be in their best interest to make sure this doesnt get out and blow up in their faces? Something to consider. Because had they not done what they did on 1/29 Thursday, many traders believe the squeeze wouldve happened that day.

From the Wall Street Journal: The Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice. The latest move came last month, when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale. But **some critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough** Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months. Until that failure is resolved, there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account, critics say. **This "phantom stock" can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.** (source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://web.archive.org/web/20210210061947/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

From everything Ive seen, as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1/26, many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented. I personally hold the following hypothesis:

* GME shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221% and 150% at various times, and as late as 1/29 reported by S3 to be 122% [https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314](https://web.archive.org/web/20210210061947/https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314)
* GME shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://web.archive.org/web/20210210061947/https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) and using those to cover their positions but not truly covering, which is illegal to cover using this particular method, and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed, potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close
* As a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more GME shares then the actual float
* The counterfeit shares can/have been used in [aggressive naked short attacks](https://web.archive.org/web/20210210061947/https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/) to further drive down the price of GME, which may have led to the precipiotous price drop starting last Monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able to [artificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shares](https://web.archive.org/web/20210210061947/https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered)
* Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to, DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts, mayve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in GME
* There was potentially collusion on 1/29 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts, it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed.

Edit: Someone asked "so whats the current short position? Looks like they some how covered?"

Pasting my response below because I'd like people to see:

I've heard people say 78%, thats still a high number, but personally I made the decision not to care about this percentage from the short interest report released today. Correct me if I'm wrong, that number is generated from data hedge funds submit and hedge funds in this context have every incentive to submit data that would favor their current position. Apparently the fine they get for submitting false is nothing more than a slap on the wrist/a small fine. I also believe hedge funds may have covered some shorts illegally using a loophole to generate synthetic longs to cover with, more on that on my post [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20210210061947/https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/). In addition, there seems to have been [some fuckery](https://web.archive.org/web/20210210061947/https://www.reddit.com/user/RubinoffButtChug69/comments/lfdcv1/fintel_changed_their_short_volume_data_after_my/) (I recommend you give this a read) with short interest numbers lately so for those reason I don't place much trust in the current reported short number, and believe the real short interest percentage could be much higher.

Title: Compass Pathways [$CMPS] - Trusting Peter Thiel With My Psychedelics Bet
Hello fellow degenerate gamblers,

Kimchi here... back with another DD to make you all some tendies. My last posted DD was all about headphones... ended up being a nice 5-bagger *with stocks*. I'm here today to tell you about Compass Pathways \[$CMPS\], a company I think will be my next multi-bagger trade.

***Psychedelics:***

Why psychedelics? Psychedelic (and $CMPS in particular) companies tend to focus on the medical aspect of shroom use, looking to create medications to **treat illnesses that are traditionally underserviced**. Compass, for example, focuses on treatment resistant depression - essentially depression that hasn't been able to be treated by medication, counseling, etc. Depression rates have been rising for years and CMPS and other psychedelic drug makers look to **target those most affected**.

[Depression rates increasing](https://preview.redd.it/bygysv8wcmg61.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3392bcff460f4e60e1d30201a20b4977fac5fc9a)

Psychedelics have also been anecdotally shown to help with [PTSD](https://maps.org/research/articles/6230-the-veteran-psychedelics-for-ptsd-what-a-long-strange-trip-it-s-been) and [opioid addiction](https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2018/09/10/ibogaine-psychedelic-opioid-misuse-therapy). It's a field that's just now starting to gain traction and hopefully those who need help the most will be able to get it as the science develops.

***Why Compass?:***

So why $CMPS out of the many stonks in the psychedelics universe?

*1) Compass Pathways is the only psychedelics company currently listed in the US.* 

I don't mess with OTC stonks (have been burned too many times) and I don't mess with Canadian listings (who calls their currency the "Loonie?). Don't know why other companies haven't listed in the US yet, but I'm not messing with those companies until they do.

*2) Peter Thiel is the largest shareholder and they have a superstar board/advisors.*

Everyone here knows and loves Peter Thiel; he owns 7.5% of the company. The board members at CMPS include the former R&amp;D head at **Merck**, the former Chairman of Global Pharmaceuticals at **Johnson &amp; Johnson**, former Executive Director of the **European Medicines Agency** among others. Their scientific advisory board includes doctors from **Stanford, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Imperial College**, etc. This is a company stacked with talent.

*3) CMPS has received FDA "*[*breakthrough designation*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-07/psychedelic-mushroom-therapy-startup-edges-toward-fda-approval)*" and are currently on phase 2 trials.*

Breakthrough designations are typically given when preliminary clinical trials show **significant improvements over existing treatments**. "Breakthrough therapies are supported by the FDA throughout the clinical development programme to ensure as efficient a process as possible."

*4) CMPS runs the COMPASS Discovery Center, which is working on finding uses for psychedelics.*

The biggest pushback against $CMPS is that they're currently only working on one product, COMP360, for the treatment of treatment resistant depression. However they also run the COMPASS Discovery Center, a collaboration between Compass Pathways and various universities to find new uses for psychedelics. **$CMPS will be the exclusive licensee for all new compounds generated.**

*5) They're just seem like good people.*

Sure this may not be important to company profits in the long term, but this is something that makes me feel a bit warm and fuzzy inside. They recently [raised](https://www.standard.co.uk/homeless-fund/compass-pathways-support-the-homeless-fund-london-b919073.html) over 1.4mil GBP (Around $2mil 'merica dollars) to **help the homeless in London**. Maybe I'm stupid, but this helps me trust the company's leaders a bit more.

**Target Price:**

I'm not a research analyst so I'm not going to break down the numbers in terms of sales of COMP360 or potential profits from licenses from potential discoveries at COMPASS Discovery Center. Smarter people than I can do that analysis...

However, just looking at how high some of the weed stocks got in 2018, I don't think a market cap of $20bn is a stretch (that would put **$CMPS at around $500 to $600 a share**) if the theme takes off. GW Pharmaceuticals, a cannabis company that specialized in creating medication from cannabis, recently got acquired for $7.2bn. I put my trust in this star-studded company to do some incredible things.

**Positions:**

5,500 shares (I don't do options) of $CMPS.

**tl;dr:** Psychedelics has the potential to help those with depression, PTSD, addiction, etc. Trust in Peter Thiel and $CMPS to take us to tendieland.

Title: GME Sucks
FUCKING SIKE! YOU THOUGHT I MEANT IT RETARD, NAH. I GOT DIAMOND HANDS TILL THE DAY I DIE AND THIS IS WHY: 
GME Short Percentage of Float is 117% - Crunching the Short Interest Numbers
  

Gather round, diamond handed apes and crayon eating retards. There is a lot of confusion about what short interest from the short interest report today actually means. Here is how it breaks down.

Today's reported short interest is 78.46. Short Interest is the percentage of short shares of the outstanding shares. Outstanding shares means ALL the shares of the stock, including restricted shares and shares held by insiders.

GME has 69,750,000 outstanding shares. 78.46% of those outstanding shares is 54,725,850 shares. So as of the settlement date of 1/29 there were 54,725,850 shorted shares out there that need to be covered. By comparison, the number of shorted shares from the 1/15 report was 61,780,000 . So since the 1/15 report to the 1/29 only 7,054,150 shorts were covered.

**Got it so far? Ok here is the good shit.**

Float is the number of shares that are available to trade. Float is the number of outstanding shares minus the restricted shares and the shares held by insiders. GME Float is 46,890,000 .

So the short float percentage is the number of shorted stocks (54,735,850) divided by the float (46,890,000) x 100. So, the **SHORT PERCENTAGE OF FLOAT IS 117%.**

Thats right, the 1/29 report tells us that the short stocks are 117% of the available GME stock. Did you all hear me?

**The next part is the REALLY GOOD SHIT**

Let's take a a look at the 7,054,150 shorts that were covered between the 1/15 report and the 1/29 report. The short interest report from 1/29 is from the SETTLEMENT date, not the trading date. It takes two days for settlement, so the short interest you see is actually from trading through 1/27. Likewise, the 1/15 report is from trading through 1/13.

Ok, according to todays report, 7,054,150 shorts were covered between 1/13 and 1/27. So what happened during that period?

On 1/13 GME opened at 20.42 and closed at 31.40. On January 27 GME closed at 347.51. That is an increase of 327.09. **That is an increase of just over 1600%!**

Of course, everyone knows what happened on the following day. The price shot up to 450, the DTC increased margins and shut down retail buyers.

Only 7,054,150 shares were covered during that 1600% increase in GME stonks. Some of that increase must have been due to people jumping on the bandwagon so the increase probably isn't completely due to the short squeeze that had started.

TLDR: The Short Interest Report today shows us that on there was 112% more shares shorted than were actually available to purchase on 1/27/21. Between 1/13 and 1/27 on about 7 million shorts were covered.

The hedges are fucked. They have been shorting like crazy since 1/27 because they were really bleeding by that point. They had to keep the price down and try to reduce retail purchases and holdings by all the shit we have seen in the subs, on twitter and tv.

Nothing has changed, the squeeze has not happened yet.

Buy Hold. Peace

TLDR:

Title: Why this is just a beginning: a guide for The GME Gang newcomers and a quick recap of the situation
Listen up you fucks, for most of you this is your first rodeo so let me tell you how this whole thing works. Some of you might remember me when I told you to hop on this tendie train at 9$ [when MSFT deal happened](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j7i28q/gme_launching_right_about_now_microsoft_agreement/), by [my DD about why GameStop is worth 138$](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jcjqba/gme_long_thesis_why_40_target_is_actually_a/) or by my other posts I've made here for months. As you've noticed, I LOVE THE STOCK.

I've held through -90% at the lowest to +10,000% at the highest and I continue holding. I'm down $300k from the ATH at this point and I don't fucking care because this whole thing is far from being over.

Now get these points through your thick head:

    
* **This is a fucking volatile stock.** 

This is how it goes: it shoots up, GME gang rejoices, a bunch of retards buys at the top. Then it crashes down for a while,  keep blabbering about how the squeeze has squoze. Rinse and repeat. Every time it shoots up it does it more violently, the amplitude getting larger and larger. And every time it does there is a number of dickheads whining about not buying earlier:

"I wish I bought at $9..." - when it shot up to $13, and them came down

"I wish I bought at $11..." - when it shot up to $20, and them came down

"I wish I bought at $17..." - when it shot up to $70, and them came down

"I wish I bought at $40..." - when it shot up to $150, and them came down

"I wish I bought at $60..." - when it shot up to $450, and them came down

**Being in GME gang was always about not caring about temporary swings, because in the end, the price always sets a new ATH**

I've seen this shit happening so many times since October that I just sit there and smile while history repeats itself and my porfolio swings 5-6 digits.

    
    
* **GME was never a squeeze play**, despite what a lot of you retards think. 

Read any DD more than a month old, the whole company is massively undervalued . Read about Ryan Cohen, a person who made a dog food company worth $45bn and who is a fucking shark, once he sets his mind to something he will never back down. Thanks to him we now have a star team assembled at GameStop formed of [Matt Francis, CTO, former Engineering Leader at AWS; Kelli Durkin, Senior Vice President of Customer Care, former Chewys Vice President of Customer Service; Josh Krueger, Vice President of Fulfillment former senior fulfillment roles at Amazon, Walmart, and QVC](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/2021/02/03/gamestop-announces-three-new-hires) (do I need to mention Reggie Fils-Aim of a fucking Nintendo?). I am a firm believer that Cohen will manage to grow GameStop at the very least to the size of Chewy ($45bn market cap). Guess what GME has? $4bn. That's 12x bagger and I'm being very conservative here.

**This is not about squeezing the hedge funds, this is about the company establishing it's true share price with wild swings along the way thanks to the s**. The true price for me is (conservatively) the size of Chewy, which translates to $650. I know I said $138 in my previous DD a few months ago, but it was before all the recent news of Ryan Cohen taking over with his star-team.

MOASS was a cherry on top (and still is on the table), not the main play

Also, GameStop had a $6bn in revenue in 2019, Tesla had $24bn. Think about it for a moment
    
    

* **Short interest is still through fucking roof**. 

I know you're used to 100%+ SI and the new 41% number does not quite gets you off, but it's still fucking abysmal. VW, OSTK happened on less than 20%. Also keep in mind that this number is for 1/29, literally the top when a lot of shorts covered. It does not account for all the shorting that happened on the way down to $50 which I guaran-fucking-tee you was massive. Just wait and see the next report with increased SI, the shorts never learn.



**TL;DR:** GameStop is still undervalued. Conservative PT is $650, ambitious - $1200+ (assuming Ryan Cohen's success, which I don't doubt for a single moment). Short squeeze will last for a long time similar to $TSLA squeeze, with wild swings along the way - old shorts will cover, new ones will pile in because the bLoCkBuStEr narrative is still strong. This is still a risky gamble, no such thing as a sure bet, but the risk\reward is massively skewed to the upside

If you have short-dated calls you might be fucked, might be not. If you have shares or LEAPS, just get away from screens for a while if it's unbearable for you, but ultimately you'll be fucking loaded. This is one of those situations when in a year or two the price is $3000+ and you post your cost basis of $70 and all the paper-handed bitches in the comments scream "WOW HE FUCKING HELD GRATZ"

**Positions:** some Apr 40c, some Apr 200c and a shitload of Jan 2023 950c. Will dump the remaining cash into 2023 calls at open

Title: NYSE v. Off-Exchange(FINRA) Short Volumes for GME: Short Volume in Public Exchanges Wasn't Even Half of Whats Needed for 150% Drop in Short Interest
   **The drop in SI from 226% to 78% required around \~100 Million shares to cover shorts, but the NYSE only saw 49 Million Short Volume, while OFF-EXCHANGES saw about 3X as much.**

Got the **Daily Short Exchange Trade data from NYSE now** so I can compare it to the FINRA numbers that I've been using in the past. General bullet points below:

# TLDR: Check bottom, look at Figure 1, and Napkin Math.

&amp;#x200B;

*  **Publicly traded stocks(GME on the NYSE) can be traded "upstairs" in OFF-EXCHANGES (OTC) but have to be reported... or should be...** 
*  **Daily Short Sales files only contain how many short sale trades were done that day.** 
*  **Short sale trades done on NYSE  are NOT in the FINRA data, and vice versa.**
*  **The GOOD STUFF is in the** [MONTHLY SHORT SALES FILES](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/trf/trf-regulation-sho-2021) **and it isn't out yet for January.** 

&amp;#x200B;

To start out we can compare the total volumes for GME across the public exchange, NYSE, against the off-exchange, FINRA's numbers.

[Figure 0: I DONT HAVE ALL THE VOLUME, as YAHOO reports nearly double what NYSE and FINRA are reporting. Missing Volume was added to show Yahoo-\(NYSE+FINRA\)](https://preview.redd.it/7rohwucqflg61.png?width=752&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf399f5180a2bc22c68320fad0eb8f542c1b3299)

* *DISCLAIMER: No idea where the Missing Volume is from, but it's not on the NYSE and not being reported to FINRA? Does Yahoo count volume some other way?*
* I sure as hell didn't know that what happens in off exchanges is about five times that of public exchanges, but we got data now. Notice how it really doesn't pick up until the 13th though, and it seems to be settling down as we get further into February.

Next I wanted to run some numbers to be able to compare to other bi-monthly reports for GME and actually look at the exact numbers across the public exchange and the off-exchanges.

Now let's use some of these numbers to check some reports.

#                                    NAPKIN MATH TIME

1. So 226% SI for around Jan 15th  and we're at 78% SI reporting now, from end of January.
2. 226-78 = \~150
3. 150% Short Interest = 150 (Shorts/SharesOutstanding)
4. Shares Outstanding = \~70Million
5. 70Million \* 1.50 = **105 Million Shorts were settled from 15th to 29th**

OK, I can believe that 105M shorts went through because that's when GME went up to to $400+

The only thing is, and here's the kicker... 

#      Of the 100+Million shorts only 49 Million were executed on the                     NYSE during Jan15th to 29th!

We still have 55 Million shorts that were executed those two weeks, and in the FINRA exchanges we can see the155 Million short volume. 

But how/where do they do this OFF-EXCHANGE trade you might ask? 

# RIGHT ON YOUR DAMN PHONE, Urist McPaperHands!!!!!

 *"For market makers with a customer order to sell, they will temporarily  sell short (which gets published to the tape as a media transaction for public dissemination) and then immediately buy from their customer in a  non-media transaction that is not publicly disseminated to avoid double  counting share volumes."*\- [OTCMarkets.com](https://blog.otcmarkets.com/2018/11/13/understanding-short-sale-activity/)

* **If you sold GME via any of those apps, chances are they bought up those shares themselves AFTER they used them to cover their shorts.**
* **The rest of the shorts are just in the ether of OTC exchanges**

Granted I can't get data for how many of the shorts were fully executed, how many started to juggle around with options, but we do know that before tonight the SI was above 200% and has been updated to 78%. 

I believe that the update is referring to data at the end of January. CORRECT ME IN COMMENTS!!!

**TLDR:** 

1. **NYSE see's only 1/5 the volume that OFF-EXCHANGES do regarding short volumes for GME**
2.  **"Short Exempts"are nearly twice as prevalent in the NYSE than OTC**
3. **Only half of the shorts were executed on the NYSE to decrease SI from 226% to 78%**

Title: NVAX - 3 to 4x potential - Market ignoring recurring revenue
Market is not paying attention to recurring revenue potential of Covid-19 vaccines. Given the scare of pandemic and [increasing mutations](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-29/world-s-most-vaccinated-nation-struggles-with-new-virus-variants), for next few years, everyone will likely be forced to take [annual jab](https://www.ft.com/content/26b256d0-d021-46ac-ae3d-e3ea823c033d) (or at the very least travellers should need vaccination proof for quite sometime)

When it comes to next jab, most people are likely to go for Novavax because:

1. [Much lower side effects as compared to Moderna/Pfizer](https://www.racap.com/media/Covid-19/COVID-19_VX_12222020_F.pdf?v=tY2fmi5jaTcPs6s4xSzi_QUhEV8v0ayLLWYwd-p1upM)
2. Cheaper (&lt;= $16 per dose)
3. Virus variants are becoming bigger problem. [Protein subunit vaccines are better placed for covering variants than MRNA](https://twitter.com/PeterKolchinsky/status/1354929047797706756)
4. They plan to make a [Combo vaccine with their Nanoflu](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-novavax/novavax-to-explore-combined-influenza-covid-19-vaccine-for-use-post-pandemic-idUKL4N2H42Z7?edition-redirect=uk) \- so instead of annual flu vaccine, people can simply go for combo
5. And obviously [highest efficacy (95.6% original, 86% UK, 60% SA strain)](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-demonstrates-893-efficacy-uk-phase-3)

It seems incredible that `NVAX market cap is just $20B when Moderna is valued at $71B`. To reach $71B, NVAX shares will need to shoot to **$1116**

It can be argued that lower price than Moderna means lower revenue. But lower price coupled with no deep freeze requirement will translate to much higher market share. On top of that, they already have another very successful vaccine (Nanoflu - influenza) which completed phase 3 trial in March 2020.

On Jan 29th, Principal investigator of their UK trial had expected [full analyses target of 100 cases to be reached in 2 weeks](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/944923#vp_2). It seems we should be pretty close to next price action now.

Title: Time to talk about UNG
Mods blocked my first post for some reason so here it is again

Haven't heard much on WSB about the freezing cold hitting the US these next weeks so I wanted to point out a strategy with retard level returns. About half the homes in the use [natural gas](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/images/whf_longformat_0132018.pdf) to heat their home and the other half uses electricity, but guess [what the majority of electricity generated in the US is with natural gas](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us.php#:~:text=Natural%20gas%20was%20the%20largest,in%202019%E2%80%94about%2023%25) at 38%. Most people are ignoring it because of the green stock push, but the only green is dollar bills :D Starting tomorrow and in the upcoming weeks its going to get extremely [cold](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/814day/index.php).

Why does this matter? Supply and Demand baby production has not recovered from its its drop last year and is not expected to return to normal until [2022](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=46476). This means that production is not replenishing storage as fast as other years. Right now there is a small surplus in working storage if weather holds (hence the long term trade) that surplus will be a deficit by Feb 19. At that point working storage is going to be 2000 BCF.  Here is the kicker there working storage can't go lower than 1000 Bcf of gas because there needs to be natural gas in the pipelines for them to work. The closer it gets to this number there, the price of natgas is going to shoot up!! Officially working storage does not stop getting emptied until the 2nd week of April meaning there is going be 8 weeks of withdraws.

The best part is that there will always be a buyer for natural gas!! Utilities will always need to buy  natural gas for electrical generation. Right now they are in denial and just keep wishing that the problem goes away. But just ask [Japanese utilities](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-07/asian-spot-lng-price-hits-record-on-cold-winter-supply-crunch) what happens when storage starts to run low!!!

**Why buy now** its cheap right now, most traders are waiting for winter to verify and the utilities are hoping that it never happens. Of course you should only be trying this if you can afford to.

$UNG is the ETF that tracks natural gas and will start going to the moon the lower the storage goes.

There are also many natural gas producers that will benefit with the rise of the price. This is especially true if management takes advantage of the price move and locks in prices for the rest of the year (they have the ability to do that) .

Because this is WSB I found the Natural gas producer with the largest short percentage at 16%. That would be RRC

For those of you that want to follow the [natural gas storage numbers](https://ir.eia.gov/ngs/ngs.html) (updated every Thursday at 10:30 ET)

**TLDR:** If you can afford to buy UNG now because its gonna get really cold in the US for the next three weeks. If you want to go full retard and attempt a short squeeze RRC is your best bet with 16% of its volume float at 16%.

Full Disclosure: 200 UNG 16 APR 21 13 C and 20 RRC 18 Jun 21 11 C

As always I'm not a financial advisor just a 3 week old WSB retard

Title: Naked shorting in GME and how the pieces suddenly fit together
TLDR: Hard to distill it into TLDR but essentially a lot of pieces clicking together if you believe there was naked shorting in GME (and there is strong evidence to support that theory). I know ape can't read but I implore you to read the whole thing

I was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME. I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes. This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle, I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now:

One of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226%, and later in the range of 150% percent of total float. Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)). Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal. In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist (there are many analysis and data points pointing to this but just one example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme\_institutions\_hold\_177\_of\_float\_why\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/)). Where do these shares come from? One potential explanation is synthetic long shares (created via a loophole described here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting.

Im an entrepreneur, not a finance expert, so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject. I started with this [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm). Failures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale. There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver. For example, human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book-entry form, thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three-day settlement period. **A fail may also result from naked short selling**.

Interesting. We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond, an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time.

According to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox, Abusive **naked short sales... can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price** to the detriment of all of its investors. The Commission is particularly concerned about **persistent failures to deliver in the market** for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO, adopted just two years ago Selling short without having stock available for delivery, and **intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three-day settlement period, is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws** We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that **substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities.** Specifically, these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership - voting, lending, and dividends from issuers. Moreover, **they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price**. (Source:[ https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm))

In a different speech Mr Cox re-iterated that short selling helps prevent "irrational exuberance" and bubbles. But **when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market  it is undermining it.** Mr Cox also referred to "the serious problem of abusive naked short sales as **a tool to drive down a company's stock price**" and that the SEC is "concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to **loopholes in Regulation SHO**" (which reminds me of this piece I wrote [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) (source for SEC Chairmans words: [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm))

As another datapoint, Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that **naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground**. (Source: This was originally in a time magazine article from 2005 which was deleted[ https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html](https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html) but the statement still exists in record in an SEC Filing from 2008[ https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm))

I also read **One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares** for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create "**phantom" or "counterfeit" shares**, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and **artificially depressing the share price**. Shortly after, I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers. Taibbi said that the two firms got a "push" into extinction from "a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling". (Source:[ https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall\_streets\_naked\_swindle](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall_streets_naked_swindle))

All these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted, which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed. If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage, GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen -- potentially even an infinite short squeeze. On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB. The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze, the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze.

On 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre-trading started (the stock shot up to 513 in pre-trading) and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day, the momentum was suddenly shut down when Robinhood (where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on) were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling, followed by several other brokers. Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying (but funds were not.) When this happened people were upset at Robinhood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between Robinhood and Citadel (which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2.5 billion to Melvin Capital, one of the short side funds, and is also responsible for something like 40% of Robinhoods entire revenue by buying their order books), but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself. Now, personally speaking, its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this. However, looking into the details of what happened, a skeptical part of me became suspicious.

Apparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to Robinhood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars ([https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/](https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/)) . So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening. On that day, there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen. Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond (which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze), hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag. Worse, DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing, I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least.

Then I read something that caught my eye DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts. From an article dating back to 2007, Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp. is a little-known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers. About 99% of the time, trades are completed without incident. But about 1% of the shares -- valued at about $2.5 billion on a given a day -- aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days, for one reason or another. **These "failures to deliver" have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices**. (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

Apparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time. According to Wall Street Journal **There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens. The fight is over how prevalent the problem is -- and the extent to which DTCC is responsible**. Some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens. DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern. (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720)).

As a thought experiment, lets say naked shorting is rampant in GME (many many indicators point to this) and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on GME, wouldnt it be in their best interest to make sure this doesnt get out and blow up in their faces? Something to consider. Because had they not done what they did on 1/29 Thursday, many traders believe the squeeze wouldve happened that day.

From the Wall Street Journal: The Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice. The latest move came last month, when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale. But **some critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough** Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months. Until that failure is resolved, there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account, critics say. **This "phantom stock" can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.** (source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

From everything Ive seen, as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1/26, many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented. I personally hold the following hypothesis:

* GME shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221% and 150% at various times, and as late as 1/29 reported by S3 to be 122% [https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314)
* GME shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) and using those to cover their positions but not truly covering, which is illegal to cover using this particular method, and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed, potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close
* As a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more GME shares then the actual float
* The counterfeit shares can/have been used in [aggressive naked short attacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/) to further drive down the price of GME, which may have led to the precipiotous price drop starting last Monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able to [artificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shares](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered)
* Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to, DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts, mayve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in GME
* There was potentially collusion on 1/29 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts, it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed.

Edit: Someone asked "so whats the current short position? Looks like they some how covered?"

Pasting my response below because I'd like people to see:

I've heard people say 78%, thats still a high number, but personally I made the decision not to care about this percentage from the short interest report released today. Correct me if I'm wrong, that number is generated from data hedge funds submit and hedge funds in this context have every incentive to submit data that would favor their current position. Apparently the fine they get for submitting false is nothing more than a slap on the wrist/a small fine. I also believe hedge funds may have covered some shorts illegally using a loophole to generate synthetic longs to cover with, more on that on my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/). In addition, there seems to have been [some fuckery](https://www.reddit.com/user/RubinoffButtChug69/comments/lfdcv1/fintel_changed_their_short_volume_data_after_my/) (I recommend you give this a read) with short interest numbers lately so for those reason I don't place much trust in the current reported short number, and believe the real short interest percentage could be much higher.

Any time you feel yourself start to get regularly dumbstruck during any and every argument with a particular person, remind yourself of these unethical and pathetically desperate tactics to avoid manipulation via asshat.

Also, as someone commented, a related concept you should know about to have the above knowledge be even more effective is Cognitive Bias and the associated concept of Cognitive Dissonance:

Title: Say it with me...R G B. If you are too busy crying about lost tendies and not looking at the $CRSR discount today, you don't deserve money
So you could continue to moan and lick your wounds that you didn't become a millionare in 3 days, or you can sack up and make your money back on a surefire play.

Today $CRSR earnings released. The numbers were killer as they have been all year (I'm not going to dive into deep DD on the earnings report itself as other posts have already done),. Future guidance is conservative but still very bullish. 

This stock has everything going for it, yet the price tanked. 

**Why? 
**

Because its 2021 and every great stock is doing the same thing. 

Check out [LOGI](https://imgur.com/D0FoKHV)....earnings call on 1/18, dipped for a day, bounced back to ATH 2 weeks later and climbing fast. We're at the bottom right now.

Was it an IV crush? Honestly this morning it was more like a bunch of short-selling in expectations of an IV crush followed by a bunch of panicky paper hands.  It's already up 5% on the day's lows

CRSR is a BARGAIN BUY right now. 

"But but but /u/dontmicrowavecats , are you sniffing glue? The price of CRSR already rose from $36 to $46, the earnings was already priced in. There will be no moon for you."

No, wrong. Why? Because the price was only at $36 due to pressure from the GME squeeze.

**Citadel owns 2% of the $CRSR Float. On 1/13, the same day GME rose 57% for the first time, CRSR tanked. CRSR was being oversold to buy GME Shares**
https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRSR/holders?p=CRSR

So the price tanks from $41ish to $36, starts recovering, then CRSR issues a secondary PO for 7.5 million shares...price drops again. 

The stock is currently BARELY trading above the previous averages right now. The entire "runup" to ER wasn't a runup at all, but rather an upward price correction.

The stock is still undervalued, and currently trading at a big discount. Today and *possibly* tomorrow will be the best day to buy CRSR you will get.

We are likely going to see $60 within 2 weeks, $70+ soon after that. 

**TL;DR** RGB = Strong Buy. #

Title: Regarding the upcoming SI report from Finra
Hey retards, we are so close to seeing this GME &amp; AMC thing through. 

Today there is a very important report coming which will let us know updated numbers on the number of shorts that major hedge funds still have.

**This report will most likely be artificially skewed in an attempt to shake out the rest of the long-term SS holders.**

***How can the report be skewed?***   
Say you have 1000 shares in short positions in a company that only has 1000 shares available. That means that your hedge fund has a 100% short interest in that company. Say, some random trove of wandering monkeys notice that your hedge fund has 100% short interest in that company, and you and your billionaire friends are all spooked because there aren't enough shares for those monkeys to buy (the short squeeze narrative). What do you do?  


You somehow have to amass enough shares to drive that short interest percent down, because you want to appear that you've closed your short positions and scare the monkeys away. So this is what you do. You buy 800 shares in long positions (using call options), and suddenly the short interest is only 20%. You have made it appear that your hedge fund is no longer unreasonably short on that stonk.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOWEVER, YOU HAVE STILL NOT CLOSED YOUR SHORT POSITION!** You still have to buy back all of those shorted stocks, and you've effectively thrown a rug over the giant shit stain in the middle of the room. It's worth it for you to do this though, because the monkeys who are expecting a moon will paper-hand and stop the short squeeze from being as severe.

&amp;#x200B;

What does this mean? Hold, despite what the report says. If the report shows high SI, then the hedgies are actually 100% boned and have not even had enough time and/or money to offset that SI number. That's huge. If the report shows low SI, HODL. The big players simply have not had enough volume to cover all their short positions, and are trying to manipulate us into thinking the MOASS was a hoax.

Title: DD : $ZBISF / $ZENA.CA - Why it Will Squeeze
Brief introduction to Zenabis, an unpopular medical marijuana stock that has been being shorted since before your wife ever met her first boyfriend. 

Im too lazy to source but Im told this is the only canadian LP with a positive EBTA. I know most of you dont know what an acronym is so just use google. 

If theres any company that got bent over and fucked by wall street its ZBISF. 

Zenabis is on track to be in the double digits within the next two years. The only reason its not is a combination of hedge fund shorts, and because nobody has a clue they exist. 

Instead of inking a loan from one of the hedge funds that short them, they took a loan from their competitor, Tilray, and will be paying it in full in record time.

If this short squeeze doesnt happen by the beginning of Q3 2021, ill tattoo a bear on my ass. 

As always, bears place calls on $ROPE

And shut the fuck up about GME, AMC, etc. 
No one fucking cares. As if WSB wasnt already casual central at 600K subs, it sure as fuck is now with 6 million of you noobie paper handed autists. This play is about as smart as it gets. 

Until schwab clears my fucking deposit :
4,200 @ $0.0969

Future Positions : 
Buying until Im bankrupt

Title: SupremeCannabis Earnings Primer fire.to/sprwf
[ORIGINAL
](https://www.reddit.com/r/Baystreetbets/comments/lg4meg/supremecannabis_earnings_primer_firetosprwf/)
Updated to meet board rules!!

https://www.supreme.ca/supreme-cannabis-schedules-second-quarter-2021-financial-results-release-and-conference-call

Thursday after close, 8am Friday Conference Call 
Current analysts Estimates -
14.27 avg net revenue (BMO and Steifel) 

David George Kosh BNN showed supreme to have 3% overall market share. 
~800mil in Q in Canada, 1/2 to LPs and likely close to 
12million net rec revenue. 

Supreme did 4.4mil wholesale and said they had stable wholesale channels last conference call. Plus they had a record sale to Israel in Q. (See news releases) 

I believe its likely they will post 16+mil for q and a very solid beat in net revenue. 

Profitability
See Sedar - Dated Sept 23 for debt covenants (for your own DD) from BMO Credit line.

The EBITDA of the Borrower shall not be less than the following amounts at thefollowing times:

1.	for the Fiscal Quarter ending December 31, 2020: $2,000,000;
2.	for the Fiscal Quarter ending March 31, 2021: $2,000,000;
3.	for the Fiscal Quarter ending June 30, 2021: $4,000,000;

From prospectus supplement from recent raise 23mil jan 25, burried in there:

"Supreme is in compliance in all material respects with the terms and conditions of the Credit Facility and no breach thereunder has been waived by the affiliated lenders under such agreements since their execution."

Confirmed in Email from IR

"Yes, we were not in breach of any covenants at the end of the year. We expect to release our Q2 results on February 11th.

So we can confirm - Supreme will show 2+mil in positive ebita. A major milestone for a Cannabis LP. 

There is about 1.5mil in average interest charges/q - so supreme should also be cash flow positive. 

At a fraction of full production, this is a major milestone.

Title: LexaGene Holdings ($LXXGF) - A rising MedTech company positioned to capitalize on an extended pandemic. Expecting ~250% returns with a ceiling potential of ~650%.
 **Company: LexaGene Holdings ($LXXGF)** 

Location: Massachusetts, United States

Industry: MedTech

**Share Price: $0.99**  **$2.50 \~250% expected returns with 25% returns priced in already over the last 2 months.**  

Market Cap: \~$146MM

**About the Company:** 

LexaGene is a molecular diagnostics company founded in 2016 dedicated to developing a fully automated, rapid pathogen detection system for use at the point-of-need where samples are collected, which offers ease-of-use, sensitivity, and breadth of pathogen detection. ***In short, LexaGene has been specializing in pathogen detection efficiency and rapid recognition times for 5 years.***

**Investment Thesis Summary:**

LexaGene Holdings ($LXXGF) is bolstered by a strong cash position with minimal liabilities and is poised to capitalize on an EUA FDA request for its flagship product, MiQLab, to gain access to over 190,000 POC facilities solely within the US. Demand for MiQLabs quick and comprehensive testing abilities for COV-19 greatly outperform the current standard maintained by the CDC and will continue as a result of short vaccine supply in the US and internationally.

**LexaGenes MiQLab System - Rapid Results Delivery, Simplicity of Use**

LexaGenes flagship product MiQLab (Multiplex Integrated qPCR Lab) System is at the forefront of medical detection technology. Simply put, the way this works is pathogen samples are loaded with a single-use disposable cartridge and all a user is required to do is press a button to begin. The system purifies the pathogens genetic material where it is then mixed with reagents and analyzed. A total of 10 reactions are assembled with 1 allotted as a control, allowing the remaining 9 to be each tested independently of each other. This is where MiQLab differentiates itself from other COV-19 detectors. Over these 9 samples, **it can test for 27 targets (including emerging COV-19 variants)** **and most importantly, deliver results in approximately 1 hour.** Not only will it reduce lag time by 95%, its use of sample preparation (which current COV-19 diagnostic kits bypass) improves the quality of data and ensures a lower margin of error. **MiQLab is also applicable to cannabis and agriculture, water quality, genotyping, and biodefense.**  

https://i.imgur.com/K1zLhio.jpg

**A New Normal - Vaccine deployment is slow and almost non-existent around most of the world.**

Despite the deployment of vaccines, only 2% (6 million) of the population in the US has been fully vaccinated. Unfortunately, vaccine production has already hit capacity, meaning COV-19 testings will continue to remain in high-demand. This high-demand for testing continues even though the US is a high priority purchaser of vaccines; this effect is exacerbated for countries with comparatively limited access to vaccines. This does not consider the vaccine failures that have occurred in countries such as China and Brazil (\~50% success rate). As such, **COV-19 cautionary procedures are most likely to continue past 2021, into 2022** and possibly even 2023 if were unlucky. 

**PRIMARY CATALYST**

**LexaGene has plans to request an EUA FDA (emergency use authorization) to bring use of its MiQLab system to POC facilities.** 

LexaGene is conducting a series of studies to bring MiQLab from a research-only function to use in POC (point-of-care) facilities to detect COV-19. Upon an EUA grant by the FDA, the MiQLab can be implemented in 193,000 hospitals and clinics in the US, however international adoption, especially within Western countries, is highly likely as well. Additionally, the simplicity of the MiQLab system will amplify the likelihood of usage within these medical facilities. It's easy-to-use process is essential for uptake by new technicians without sacrificing the higher standard of accuracy that has it over current CDC-approved COV-19 tests. **LexaGene has already initiated a program to identify UK and South African COV-19 sequences.** Given that the MiQLab is a tried and true product thats been in reliable use within research, I believe the probability that LexaGene will be granted an EUA is exceedingly high and once granted, adoption by POC facilities is almost certain. 

**Summary of Financials:** 

**LexaGene has the cash available to capitalize on pandemic demand for MiQLab.** 

As of November 30, the majority of LexaGenes assets are $10MM in cash, while liabilities amount to only $1.9MM. The companys largest cash consumer is R&amp;D followed by their increasing costs ramping up their marketing and promotion. In that quarter, LexaGene raised $13MM through the issuance of shares implying a forecasted need for a large amount of capital, hinting at a favourable disposition towards an EUA grant. In light of no sales, **with zero debt and a healthy cash position, there is minimal worry of solvency trouble for LexaGene, while leaving it** **ready to react to an exponential demand for its product.** 

**Key Leadership:**

**CEO Jack Regan inventor of MiQLab with a strong technical background in virology** 

CEO and Founder Dr. Jack Regan invented and patented the microfluidic system within MiQLab. After attaining a PhD in Virology in 1998, he has been working within the molecular medtech industry for the last 22 years and was also the lead scientist in developing a predecessor instrument designed for bio-warfare surveillance adopted by the Department of Homeland Security and a second R&amp;D instrument designed for detecting respiratory pathogens from nasal swab samples. 

**COO Steven Armstrong with 25 years in the commercialization of complex medical devices** 

Throughout his career, he has been responsible for obtaining FDA and global regulatory approvals in over 100 countries for more than 50 devices with hundreds of indications, implementing best-in-class quality management systems, and ensuring worldwide compliance. Mr. Armstrong started his career involved with the development and launch of LASIK technology and has brought new laser and light-based technologies to a variety of medical specialties over the past 25 years for organizations including Palomar Medical Technologies and IPG Medical in both human clinical and veterinary technologies. *(Taken from the LexaGene website)*

**SUMMARY:**

***Following an EUA grant, LexaGene has the cash available to bring MiQLab to thousands of POC facilities for the growing demand of rapid and accurate COV-19 tests.*** 

**Disclaimer**: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice just my personal opinion of LexaGene. I am currently invested in LexaGene.

Title: Some DD on TLRY/APHA since none of you seem to get it
All prices listed in USD. Using the US tickers. Holding 500 shares of APHA, not giving advice just putting out details.

Prices at time of writing:

* **TLRY** - 42.39

* **APHA** - 23.19


**Background:** Tilray (TLRY) and Aphria (APHA) are two companies based in Canada that sell marijuana. A few years ago both of these companies went to the moon, especially TLRY which reached $300 a share before crashing back down. 


**Current Catalysts**

*Merger:* Recently they announced a merger, set to finalize this year. The combined company will trade under the TLRY name and ticker, but APHA is acquiring TLRY. Those holding APHA will get ~0.84 shares of the new company (TLRY) for each APHA share they hold.

*Arbitrage gap:* Both companies have skyrocketed since announcing the merger, boosted by other news such as the Dem majority, Biden's election, and opening new deals in the UK. Oddly, TLRY has outpaced APHA, leading to a massive gap in share price. At the 0.84 share conversion APHA shares should be currently trading at $35.60. 

*Market share/Cap:** The combined TLRY/APHA will be the largest weedstock in the world by sales, with one of the highest margins as well. However, they are currently undervalued compared to CGC, the largest weedstock by market cap, by about 5 billion dollars, or ~50% of their current market cap. You may remember CGC was awarded a 5 billion dollar investment a few years back by Constellation Brands.

**Future Catalysts**

* Merger - Not finalized, but very likely to be finalized soon

* Partnership - Likely, as they will be the largest company and have the largest global footprint. Who the partner will be is unknown, but it is likely that they get one

* US Legalization - Dems could hold this up, but all signs point to reform coming

* US Banking reform - This will allow all sorts of money to flow into the sector that is current prohibited because marijuana is still illegal at the federal level

**Stupid Questions I keep seeing**

* No, this isn't like last time. When TLRY went to $300 it was shorted 33%. It is currently shorted 50% and has actual catalysts and sales behind it now

* The price looks different on Canadian tickers because they trade in Canadian dollars. It is still the same company

* If you own APHA, when the merger comes you will get 0.84 TLRY shares for each APHA share. It is that simple. If it isn't an even number you get some cash back. If you own calls, the calls will be bundles of 84 shares instead of 100. Seriously, this isn't hard math

* Yes they can still run, they are undervalued compared to CGC and the US market is bigger than Canada, UK, and Germany combined.

* Yes they can still drop. If I knew for certain it was going up I'd have more than 500 shares and be much less poor

* TLRY could drop to close the gap, or APHA could rise. No one knows which will happen. APHA is likely the safer play at this point, as it is cushioned by the gap in share price. 

**This is not financial advice. It is just some things I thought you would like to know**

Title: The End of the Telcos
Everyone take a look at the following stonks:  
Verizon, Centurylink, AT&amp;T, Frontier Communications

None have increased in price since 1999. Only Verizon is near its peak in 99; AT&amp;T is half the price it was then. Centurylink is 1/5th the price. Frontier is 1/500th the price.

All of these companies have something in common: They all own Bell's old wireline assets. And they've done nothing with them. For the twenty five years or so they've held them.

These companies are, collectively, the biggest service providers for rural "broadband" (it's an oxymoron) in the United States. They are also all reporting dwindling landline subscribers year over year, due in large part to the poor service and poor price point for a service that no longer works as well as it once did, due to crumbling copper infrastructure and failed (and/or refusal to commit to) fiber replacement.

Verizon and AT&amp;T have both offered very substantial dividends for years (and received hundreds of billions in taxpayer subsidy) as opposed to reinvesting those billions of dollars into necessary upgrades to infrastructure and maintenance. They have also reported consistent layoffs of technical personnel in every passing year. I suspect Centurylink and Frontier have reported the same. Great way to pad balance sheets in failing companies!

Now, Verizon and AT&amp;T both own wireless systems; Verizon being the self-proclaimed 'largest nationwide provider.' But there's a problem here for both of them. T-Mobile is blowing them out of the water in urban areas with faster speeds and truly unlimited data, and in rural areas, where they have a stranglehold, the ROI is not very good. To make matters worse, competitors like Starlink, and later, OneWeb and Project Kuiper, are coming online and the telcos are not prepared to compete against them in their rural regions.

The fact that both AT&amp;T and Verizon attempted (and more or less failed) to move into the media sphere with acquisitions over the years seems to imply they weren't very interested in staying telecommunications companies. In fact, I believe their goal, long term - and there are articles supporting this out there - was to let the old ATM/copper network rot completely, and become solely wireless companies. No more unlimited data landlines, no more telephone subscribers. That's a much bigger chunk of their current revenue than people may realize.

If these companies keep losing ground in urban areas, they will face insurmountable monetary challenges in the next decade due largely in part to their own hubris. They figured wireless would be the solution to everything, but as it turns out, if you don't run fiber to the farmland, wireless might as well be dial-up.

**tl;dr** The telcos are quickly running out of time and resources to make up for their mistakes over the last twenty years. If they don't act soon, it will be lights out.

Title: Tanker Stocks are Smooth Sailing
Sea shanties are hot in the streets. And while we're still waiting for our rocket ship to take off with GME, we can still explore the ocean. Which by the way is still like 95% unexplored, but thats a story for another time. 

Theres another reason to be a little bullish on oil tankers, however. With Biden cancelling the Keystone Pipeline, a lot of our national oil needs are left unmet. The green fuel revolution is still a ways off. We still need oil. But we're just gonna need to get it from other places. Thats where the tankers come in. They've had a little bit of a rough year, but who hasn't. They're also underbought. Thats why I like these stocks. And so do a lot of the institutions. They're not shorting it either, they're holding. These stocks have great value right now and they will until renewables and EVs take over a larger segment of the market, if they ever do. 

I am not a financial advisor, just another autist who has absolutely no idea what the fuck they're doing. But I am ready to go in heavy with the roughnecks. I love seamen and I love these stocks!

Title: GME is still on the table, hear me out why
So we all have been waiting on the report today, what did it show?

[As I'm writing this there's only 600k shares available to short.](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme) That means short volume has only been **increasing** instead of decreasing. You can see this in the past few days; action has been choppy as fuck and there's obvious liquidity issues happening.

In simple terms, what does this mean for a smoothbrained retard like you?

IT MEANS THE HEDGEFUNDS ACTUALLY DOUBLED DOWN! Instead of covering, those absolute fucking mongrels went and bought **more shorts** despite being 10bn down the shitter. You have to give it to them, it's a real YOLO play and given the GME sentiment around wsb recently, it's been partially working. Not on me though, I'm still holding that motherfucker I bought at $399 and I don't intend to sell.

Now, is this representative of today, 9th of February? Probably not, but it's a good fucking estimate. Just look at the volume we had since 29th, there's no chance anyone covered while stock was going down so hard. My guess is, whatever hedgefund that caused the gamma squeeze pulled out because they were paperhanded bitches hence the drop+YOLO shorting from balls deep hedgefunds. The actual squeeze is still possible. In fact, it's almost a guarantee another gamma squeeze will happen, I just don't know when. I've expected this to pop the fuck off after seeing the giant SI% numbers, but guess not today.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr keep fucking holding retards

Title: Datto (MSP) &amp; Options Play
Datto is a recently IPO'ed company that makes backup &amp; disaster recovery equipment for IT people. Being an IT person, their products are best in class and rock solid. They also sell routers &amp; switches as well as a ticketing platform for IT departments/companies. When they first launched their IPO a few months ago, I bought some shares and have been following them since. Their network equipment reminds me of Cisco Meraki, just at the very beginning of their launch(I did the same w/ Ubiquiti $UI, and have rode it from $55 to $350/share).  


They are about to release their 2nd earnings report on 3/11. This is where I found a pretty good options play. Share price is roughly $24.87-$25 right now, and the 3/19 call options at $22.50 is trading around $4. This means the stock only has to rise to $26.50 or $1.63 during their earnings report timeframe to win on this. Given this is their 2nd earnings release(their first one was right around their IPO, so it was pretty buried), if they have good news, this could be a big winner. I believe the $20 call options may have an even smaller gap to cross, likely closer to $25.75, or $1.10.

&amp;#x200B;

The bonus is that their equipment is generally sold in contracts, so the likelihood of them having a poor quarter is minimal. I have bought call options and own shares. Not financial advice, I just like the stonk.

Title: $UMC and other less glamorous semi-conductor manufacturers will likely do well in the coming months
With stock shortages on many different nodes from the likes of Samsung, TSMC and even Intel (which has a very dominate position in the server-space), there have been problems getting various products to market. Entire automative factories have been shut-down due to constraints on on getting chips in their vehicles. This phenomenon was predicted to be less unrelenting, but recently, many manufacturers (particularly Microsoft regarding the Xbox Series X) have basically admitted that they simply cant sell their products due to the limits on chips designers limits of wafers of a given process node.

As a rundown, Intel, TSMC are the big fabs that you hear about in advanced computing technology. AMD uses TSMC, but AMD is on a 4-front battle with its console, desktop CPU, server CPU, and GPU market, as well as mobile chips.

Essentially, chip *designers* are being constrained by their ability to gain access to various chips. But the fabs behind these big-name computing technology companies that youre used to hearing about are.

TSMC is producing process nodes that perform very well. Except, their supply is very limited. Keep in mind, Chip *designers* will often times outsource their designs to be made on different nodes. Intel uses TSMC, even though it has its own fabs, for instance. And Intel also rents out their own fabs.

This is where $UMC and various other lesser-known semi-conductor manufacturers come in. They will likely fill the massive demand for *any* process node that chip designers can get their hands on to fill the unprecedented shortages which seem to be pushed back farther and farther.

Eventually, your average, run-of-the-mill devices will need chips in them, and they are likely to have difficulties working with more well-renowned chip-makers to actually put their architectures on a given node. In general, chip-manufacturers have had the lions share of consistent performance over the past year due to increasingly innovative products from high-profile designers. Its quite possible many device-manufacturers will opt not to use larger semi-conductor fabs as big-names like AMD, NVidia, and even Apple are competing for the same nodes.

At the very least, a lot of the previous success of semi-conductor manufacturers and chip designers may potentially trickle down to lesser-utilized and less glamorous fabs.

Theres already a precedent that very specialized chip designs will often go to these manufacturers, and now that the big names literally are fighting for these advanced nodes, many chipmakers have used Global Foundries and other less sexy fabs to meet demand for chips that they *need* now.

In general, companies with semiconductor fabs are likely to do well, simply due to the fact that the world in general needs more wafers, substrates etc... as infrastructure becomes more complex, digitally.

I recommend researching semi-conductor manufacturers who have long been underdogs.

Title: PTON - Short term technical play, Long term extremely bullish 
This post is going to describe a play that's kinda technical. So stop gnawing on your crayons for a second and pay attention.

First off, quick summary for people who can read an 8-K. If you only understand  , don't worry, I explain it in more detail with more emojis.

PTON just finalized sales of convertible notes and they're using $71M from the proceeds to buy call options on themselves to negate any dilutionary effects. They state in their 8-K  that the option counterparty is going to be buying PTON stock IMMEDIATELY to hedge risk. However you cut it, that's likely 300k-1M+ shares that need to be bought this week, and the daily volume yesterday was 14k.

## The Play

If that was gibberish, I'll try to spell it out. PTON just sold $1B of convertible notes to wall street.

***What are convertible notes?***

Convertible notes are a type of debt, but instead of just offering to repay the debtor with cash, you give them the option of converting their loan to newly issued shares at a price established before hand. You could also think of it as a call option but, if it's out of the money at expiration, you can get your premium back, and if it's in the money you can ask the company to issue new shares for you.

***What's a call option?***

GTFO

***But wait, isn't creating new shares bad? Wouldn't that dilute the stock?***

Congrats on following along, normally yes. Normally shareholders react negatively to announcements of convertible notes. But PTON is simultaneously buying call options that will accrue value if their common stock gains enough value for the notes to be "in the money".

***What's the "strike price" for PTON's convertible notes?***

This is called the conversion price. The notes are only worth more than their face value if PTON closes above **$240/share**.  That's 65% upside from today.

***How big is the loan?*** 

PTON initially offered $600M of notes with the option to purchase an additional $90M. Clearly there was so much interest in that they expanded it to $875M with the option to purchase an additional $125M. 

***Is there an expiration date?***

Neither party can do anything before 2024, between 2024 and 2026 investors can convert their notes.

***What's the interest rate?***

Get this, it's **0% interest**.

Let me repeat all that, as it's insane. **The debtors agreed to let PTON owe them $1B for 4-6 years at 0% interest, in exchange for the privilege of converting their investment into PTON shares at $240/share in 4 years.**

Meaning who ever is making this loan not only thinks PTON shares are going to be worth AT LEAST $240 in 4 years, but above $240 enough that this will beat inflation and any other safer investment they could make with that money.

***What's the significance of PTON using call options?***

They state in their 8-K that **they expect the option counterparty (the seller of the call options) to purchase PTON common stock to hedge their position, concurrently or immediately after pricing**. Pricing was finalized this morning. This will happen this week. In order to reach a delta neutral position the option counterparty has to purchase a lot of shares. How many, I don't know, depends on the delta of the spreads, but since they're buying $70M in call spreads that are $116 wide, I assume anywhere between $50M of shares to something like $150M. That's about \~300k-1M shares. That's a big chunk of the average volume however you cut it.



**How to play this?**



Buy call options and shares. I am personally going with 6/18 $160c. I will likely roll these 30 to 60 days to expiration as I see PTON as a long term play. You can choose something closer to expiration.

Caveat, the short term play may not work out. If you buy FDs you might lose your money. The counterparty may do an OTC transaction that gets reported at a later date. I don't really know how any of that works, and you're reading a non-professional's analysis. 

If you buy longer expiration options or shares, even if the price doesn't go up this week, it will go up eventually. 

## LONG TERM BULLISH STUFF

This is going to be a subjective argument. As a general piece of advice, reading random laypeople's number crunching on the internet is not going to serve you well. I'm being honest with you that I've neither put in the work nor am I qualified to be estimating future earnings or giving you a price target.

That being said, I have some financial advice for you: PTON is going to the moon   and you should take a bullish position if you like money.

Yes, I've read all the bearish crap about their financials. The thing is, companies look risky until they don't. I think this one will break out. Clearly lots of wall street institutions think so as well.

## Fundamentals

***Institutional ownership?***

70%. Wall Street is bullish af on this. 

***Why would someone buy a $1500 exercise bike with an ipad?***

I mean this in a non-judgemental and nice way but if you don't understand why someone would purchase a $1500 exercise bike, you are probably poor. 

PTON really is the first luxury product in this category. They really succeeded in making the product aspirational. People *want* to own this bike. There is a certain Apple like feel to it. It's a class signifier. It says something about the owner. It looks pretty. You can display it in your living room if you want.

It's cheaper than an Equinox membership. Yes you could go to planet fitness for cheaper but you could also drink ketchup for dinner.

If you have the money, it doesn't make sense to skimp too much on exercise equipment. If you're gonna hate your janky bike from AliExpress, you won't use it.

PTON keeps reporting quarter after quarter that **they are supply limited:** they're selling these bikes as fast as they can be made. This is flying off the shelves like Teslas.

Their subscription plan has the lowest rates of churn in the industry.

***End of the pandemic?***

Your view of the pandemic is short-sighted. The changes in the economy are not temporary, the pandemic really accelerated trends that were already there. I don't expect people to go back to gyms. Lots of people bought exercise equipment during this period, including myself. I hate gyms so much. People stare at you, it's far away, you have to change in public like it's high school.

The experience of hopping on your bike and joining a spin class or doing your own routine is 1000x better. I have become evangelical about how great owning a home spin bike is. Gyms lied to you with their stupid machines, whatever they have at gyms is easily replicated with a yoga mat, a set of  dumbbells and an exercise bike. That's really all your gym needs. Gyms were a flawed concept that relied on making cancellation difficult and making you feel bad about it.

***Positions*** 

6/19 160c 

Shares 

**tl:dr;** Some options writer has to buy a million PTON shares this week, maybe. Also long term PTON is the future of exercise and it's going to the moon.

**Disclaimer**; I am long PTON. I will gain money if this goes to the moon.

Title: $CGC - A goliath on their last legs.
Hello all, 

I will keep this post really simple. Canopy is a weed company in Canada that has lost money for the past 2 years after being semi-acquired by their parent company Constellation Brands. **Canopy is worth 17 billion dollars despite never producing a profit.**  

Canopy has burned 1 billion dollars of direct cash burn over the past year and invested roughly another 1 billion in United States and Canadian businesses. These investments have amount to 1.9 goodwill and a horrible cash position at 673m. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Sept 30th](https://preview.redd.it/nwnon28ungg61.png?width=716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4cbe3bd3bae43ca3b36673ace4e81af09cff3a1)

Canopy reported earnings today and stated that they have 1.5B in cash and cash equivalents, a loss of .39 billion (hilarious wording or $390 million) at the end of the quarter today. They have not uploaded their current balance sheet to SEDAR. 

So they either have less investments or spent another 170 million in direct cash. Putting us at around 500 million in direct cash.

Hidden in today's earnings/press release - 

 *As additional consideration for the assets being transferred and the termination of the royalty agreement, Canopy Growth will make a cash payment to CRC of $115 million and issue an aggregate of 3,750,000 commons shares to CRC.*

Canopy will need to spend another 115 million and dilute shareholders to divest from another horrible Canadian business they acquired back in 2018 or whatever. This will hit the books next Q as Canopy Rivers has to vote/agree to that consolidation of capital. 

From there, we have $500 million - $115 from this settlement = $375 million in direct cash after this transaction set up for next quarter, and projected cash burn from operations at another $100 million. **To be fair, the CEO has been cutting costs and it is all over the press releases about their efforts.** 

Either way, they are at to be fair $275 million in direct cash and 1.2 billion in investments going into next quarter. **They are going to have to raise capital.** 

\----

Topic change, well Canopy is in a growth sector. Sales must be booming in Canada, with a population of 35 million people! Yea well, they were. In November, it actually started to decline. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img wsgwq37gpgg61...*

\---

Okay, so what about Constellation helping out Canopy. Well If you look at the actual agreement, Constellation extended the payment tranche out to November 2023. So they hold the option to deliver 5 billion dollars to Canopy by November 2023. That's amazing flexibility for Canopy, right?! Yea you would think so, but the reason it was extended is directly related to Constellation's balance sheet right now. 

Constellation's last Q:

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img bckpgtjmqgg61...*

Now, no one is doubting Constellation's ability to raise cash. They have immense liquidity, but if you actually look at their balance sheet. They have 10 billion in debt. They can either provide shares to Canopy and royally fuck over current STZ shareholders, or take on debt to provide it. **The deal is going to get restructured.** They will never provide 5 BILLION dollars to a company that can turn a profit. 

Options Chain:

[The April 16 35P with 9,000 contracts. ](https://preview.redd.it/pvqg5fw5rgg61.png?width=734&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=038ee66cafd5aa2033a5e8b127608931da243f76)

There's my position. I am all in bitches. Weed cannot go up forever. The company is worth 17 billion dollars. STZ is not going to provide 5 billion dollars to a company that already accumulated 1.9 billion in goodwill, will need more cash to fund US legalization, and cannot even turn a profit. 

Let the puts fly.

Title: Daddy's DD of the week: $BB
So i've been doing some research on certain companies and have been doing well on the one's i invest. This is my first DD so let's see how it goes!

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and these are my own opinions.

So, where to begin with $BB? We have seen the rise and fall of so-called, "meme stocks" to which $BB was grouped in with. Shortly thereafter, we saw some of them drop off ($BB, $NOK, etc.) while the focus remained on $GME and $AMC.

I am writing this because I, personally, believe in a huge rebound for $BB because they are the forefront of modern technology when it comes to autonomous vehicular design. In the article below we see that $BB's QNX technology is being utilized with Motional's autonomous vehicle design. This is as of Feb 9, 2021 (TODAY!)

[https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberrys-qnx-black-channel-communications-to-be-used-in-motionals-driverless-platform](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberrys-qnx-black-channel-communications-to-be-used-in-motionals-driverless-platform)

Here we see, "[BlackBerry Limited](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en) (NYSE: BB; TSX: BB) today announced an expansion of its strategic partnership with [Baidu](http://iv.baidu.com/), whose high-definition maps will run on the [QNX Neutrino Real-time](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-neutrino-rtos) Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of [GAC Group](https://www.gac-motor.com/) (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.)."

[https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology)

For those of you who don't know, BAIDU is a Chinese multi-national corporation valued at over 573 Billion dollars. This is HUGE news.

As if that wasn't enough, they also mentioned in Dec of 2020 a partnership with AWS to utilize their software to accelerate their innovation with new intelligent vehicle data platform.

[https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform)

I find this all super promising as it appears that $BB has drawn away from the idea of phones and has started investing time and resources in their software for the future of society which in my opinion is autonomous vehicles.

Whether this is short or a long term play, I LIKE THE STOCK!

p.s. if this goes well i would like to start doing weekly DD's

Title: Corsair Earnings Report
[https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020](https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020)

&amp;#x200B;

**Major Highlights**

* 55% increased revenue YOY
* Over 100% increased revenue
* Full year of surpassing earnings expectations
* Outlook to increase revenue by another 5-10% throughout 2021

**Competitors**

* Primary competitor is LOGI.  CRSR outpaces LOGI in earnings growth.  CRSR operates at a market cap of 4B, compared to LOGI's 15B, despite having a revenue approx. half of LOGI's, pointing to CRSR being undervalued.

**Issues**

* Low float, leading to higher volatility.  Can be a benefit if looking at playing options spreads (keep that IV crush away from me)
* IPO Lockup.  Ends on March 22, so expect a potential decrease as early investors take profits.

Overall, CRSR has another quarter of showing a quickly growing company with a huge chunk of their market.  Bullish

Yearly revenue up about 58%. But that's not even the main draw for me.

They are expecting nearly **$2 billion** in revenue for 2021. And the current market cap is $4.16 billion. They are literally trading at only about twice the 2021 revenues. Which is the cheapest valuation for a company growing at this rate. [AMD is trading at over 10 times their expected revenues in 2021...](https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e44df3ff133f4000628a0be/960x0.jpg)

For such a small market cap stock, CRSR is an absolute steal 

And they are profitable quarterly and yearly! Planning to launch a bunch of new stuff this year. 

Potential acquire target which will sent them over 40% up overnight.

The stock will double in no time..buy!

Title: GEVO is a great company with lots of upside potential
GEVO's co-CEO just won the nobel price in chemistry and guess what, she's also on Biden's science advisory board \[1\]\[2\]. Now what are they actually doing? They're making jet fuel from plants. Jet fuel! Do you realize, this is the only available way to make planes "clean" in the foreseeable future? This will only change once batteries are dense enough to make electric planes - we're not there and even if we'd come up with the technology tomorrow, it'd still take many years to replace all planes. And it gets even better. They hold a patent on this tech, so only they can do it \[3\].

GEVO is still a small cap, but they might totally play along XOM (200 billion), Shell (120 billion) or BP (74 billion) in a couple of years. Worst case at this point is that they will stay where they are, I just don't see how the stock could go down given the circumstances - the next 4 years will be smooth sailing under Biden.

Also I should mention that you're basically helping the environment by investing in this. You'll make it easier for the company to raise cash and be successful.

Title: FREE MONEY ALERT [5]: ON Semiconductor ($ON)- 40C EXP 4/16
Not usually one for betting on all time highs, but ON provides extremely well priced options despite its current upward trend and momentum.

The biggest thing with ON is institutional ownership. So if you dont want to take my word for it, take the over ten-billion down that vanguard, fidelity, Blackrock and a number of large brokers collectively have on this company. 

Im a big fan of Hassane, this dude is making some moves to better position the company marginally to capitalize on the majorly emerging EV, Alternative Energy, Aerospace, and 5G markets. With demand currently outweighing supply, semiconductors whether ON or not will be strong investments, and are key to most alternative energy methods, so both markets will grow and evolve in tandem with each other. 

ON in comparison to the other semi stocks is much lower priced, and with institutions holding a majority of the float, a large amount of 2023 convertibles, and still increasing their share positions, once a majority of the general public moves to semis it will explode similar to PLUG power, which was a near identical situation. Although there may be some convertibles causing a degree of share dilution, with the increases in broader market investment the impact should be fairly small. 

Most importantly to all of this the options are cheap as absolute shit. I believe we are going to see a large spike in Theta value by April, making calls now a much better deal then the near future. You can get ATM contracts for $250, meaning it only has to cross 42.5 by April to break even, which is a fucking joke, and what Id call a great options deal. 

Note: I dont provide sell points, so dont ask. Every post Ive made provides the opportunity to make money, it wont change with ON, dont be to greedy, and take your free money once its there.

Title: I believe Qualcomm will recover
This is not financial advice. This is my first DD so please leave feedback. 


I believe Qualcomm has been brutally oversold. I expect a large rebound in the following months. 

Following their [most recent earnings report Q1 2021](https://investor.qualcomm.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001728949-21-000022/0001728949-21-000022.pdf) on the 4th of February their stock dropped 10% in 2 days. However, their earning report was strong and they maintain confidence that they will have a strong Q2 earnings too with an EPS of $1.65 (analysts were expecting an EPS of $1.57). The Q1 ER had an EPS of $2.17 per diluted share which is more than double their Q1 2020 $0.99 EPS. Although their ER beating high estimates of $8 billion in sales by an extra $200 million, [their licensing division brought in $1.35 billion of an estimated $1.43 billion.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/qualcomm-stock-earnings-chips-apple-51612390489) Their equipment and services division brought in $6.440 billion. They had an operating income of 2.5 billion.


Qcom has a healthy balance sheet with $7 billion in cash and very little short term debt. They do have $15 billion of long term doubt, which would be entirely covered by their cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. They can chip away at this debt slowly in this low interest period whilst focusing on R&amp;D.


All sounds good, so why did the stock tumble so bad? Ive looked at different sources and have read that business analysts are worried about the limited manufacturing capacity across the semiconductor industry. However, I believe this is bullish. With demand higher than supply, it allows for the flexibility in price and larger profits whilst reinvesting back into manufacturing. Furthermore, I do not believe the dip is for this reason as other US chip producers such as Broadcom, Nvidia and the likes also are experiencing the same chip shortage and their stocks have not dipped in the same way. AMD has dipped in a similar way after beating earnings in true fashion and is showing signs of recovery which makes me bullish of a rebound. 

 It is possible the sell off may be due to [citi downgrading their PT to $165 from $194.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/qualcomm-stock-gets-a-downgrade-at-citi-after-earnings-2021-02-04) This is still higher than the current price by a bit but is slightly more bearish. Qualcomm has 77% of shares held by institutions, so youd expect less volatility considering recently they have been loading up on shares, however, this data is prior to earnings. Updated figures on institutional holding reports are filed within 45 days after calendar quarter end - the 21st of March. [The most credible reason for the dip may be due to analysts having higher forecasts for the licensing division, however, I do believe the reaction has been very disproportionate especially when following EPS for the next quarter remains strong.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/04/why-qualcomm-stock-is-falling-today/)




Probably some bad DD. Not financial advice. Please tell me how to improve.

Title: BuT ANALySts SaY RkT IsNt A bUy; No shit jello-brains and here's why: $RKT DD Part I of III
As you smooth brains know I am knee deep in RKT Stock and for good reason: they will be the Amazon of fintech. RKT will achieve this the same way Amazon became the powerhouse of e-commerce and that is through their unique culture. 

Both AMZN and RKT have powerful cultures that are built around  shocking rules"  rituals and practices that are memorable, and so bizarre, that people inside the organization encounter almost daily, and that people who hear about them wonder why they are necessary.  

My second DD will be devoted to RKT's shocking rules and the culture I witnessed as a Rocket Mortgage banker. RKT DD Part III will focus on Rocket's vision to make Detroit the fintech capital of the world by doing much more than just writing loans.

But for my first DD I want to discuss the elephant in the room: RkT StOcK HaSn'T DoNe ShIt. 

Yes you drooling shit-for-brain autists are correct, RKT has performed very poorly in a market where nearly every company is hitting all time highs.... But what you pea-brained dip shits don't understand is that you are believing exactly what the institutions want you to believe: which is that RKT isn't a buy. When in reality, RKT is a gold mine and the fat cat tutes know it. 

RKT DD Part 1 will explain the market manipulation RKT is experiencing, how it works, who is doing it and why they are doing it. I will also discuss another successful company that experienced this in 2012 and how I believe RKT will have a similar outcome as the company I mention.

Title: ($HUYA, $SKLZ) Flashing DD - Sleeping E-Sports Streaming Giant - 20 Day SMA Ground Floor
**What is $HUYA?** 

*Processing img avl0ch5oqcg61...*

Your mother, grandmother, auntie, and your wife's girlfriend know all about online games and esports streaming. Why not you? Stop working your right hand to your sister's onlyfans and put on your big boy pants for some solid DD. Stop getting off topic. No we're not talking about your lack of cunnilingus SKLZ exacerbating your wife's lesbian adventures. We're talking about Huya, your new Asian sugar momma who just wants to talk to your meat.

&amp;#x200B;

What is HUYA?

HUYA Inc. operates live game streaming platforms in China. Its platforms enable broadcasters and viewers to interact during live streaming (emotes, donations, subs). Its live streaming content covers a library of games, including mobile, PC, and console games; and other entertainment genres, such as talent shows, anime, outdoor activities, live chats, online theatre, and other genres. The company operates Nimo TV, a game live streaming platform primarily in Southeast Asia and Latin America. It also provides online advertising and marketing services. In addition, the company provides software development and Internet value added services. As of December 31, 2019, its live streaming content covered approximately 3,800 games. The company was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in Guangzhou, the Peoples Republic of China. HUYA Inc. is a subsidiary of Tencent Holdings Limited. 

&amp;#x200B;

* With Tencent's backing, Huya is merging with the second largest game streamer in China, DouYu (estimated 80% market share behemoth post merger).
* Huya is still growing strongly on its own with or without said merger.
* 31x 2020 forward earnings does not seem too expensive for a company currently showing strong growth in sales and earnings, while being the game live-streaming leader in China. 
* News broke out that China has anti-trust concerns with said merger between Huya and DouYu. The 8.5% drop today happened swiftly and the stock price is hovering above the 20 SMA.

**$SKLZ Comparison To Upcoming US Esports Streaming Platform** 

Visit their website for the love of your unborn child [https://www.skillz.com/](https://www.skillz.com/)

$SKLZ is the only straight play on an American company with online gaming esports streaming potential. Their website is basically yahoo games from early 2000s. Recent NFL multi year contract with no mobile product yet. The only possible reason why valuations like this exist is their profit margins on their Bingo, Pool, Solitaire... yahoo 2000s games. Careful with this one as once NFL takes a cut from the licensing agreement the margins won't be so gravy. Otherwise this is a house of cards on 15.83B valuation based on 162M revenue grossing 153M. Great profit margins, but valuation is beyond insane with no NFL mobile app. For the smooth brains, you need to multiply 162M x 100 to even get close to the 15.83B valuation.

**Conclusion**

Huya trades under 4x revenue (Revenue **1.53B |** Market Cap  **5.77B)**  for being a leader in online esports streaming in the most populous country with the most gamers in the world. Where else can you find such a gem in this market? The 8.5% drop today from anti-trust concerns is simply smoke and mirrors. With or without the merger between Huya and DouYU this stock is a buy at the current valuation. China and anti-trust concerns are a joke. BABA had anti-trust concerns in Dec 2020 for not reporting prior takeovers and were fined $75k. BABA is valued at 710.47B.

Title: 2-20 bagger with PSTH
Hope you bought MVIS today after I recommended in my other post from the weekend.  An easy 25-30% gain isnt so bad and much more to come.

Now you people need to learn about PSTH.  Id say go to r/PSTH for the DD but the truth is, there really isnt any DD to be had.  This is a SPAC which means their sole purpose is to take our cash and go buy a company to bring public.  

Rumours are that its Stripe which has been said to be the next $1T dollar company but who knows, maybe its Bloomberg, StarLink or any number of amazing opportunities.

You buy PSTH for the man on top, which is Bill Ackman.  Hes rich and is good at making money, do you need to know more?

The best part is hes supposed to announce in Q1 and could even be this week or next.  Upon announcement this thing may double or triple and over the next months/years this could be a steady climb to a 10-20 bagger or more.  

Buy in increments of 9 shares to maximize warrants.  Go read the S1 if you care why.

TLDR: Buy PSTH. Shares, options, anything really and let some rich guy make you rich.

Positions: ~2500 shares + 25 x 25C June 18 + 10 x 30c March 19.

Title: Value / Earnings Play $BIO 
Disclaimer: I found about this stock today using Td stock scanner, I hold no positions in this yet. I am not a financial adviser, I'm a college student that FOMOs into plays. I simply like the stonk.

# What is $BIO?

Marketcap: **18.58B.** Price:  628.68. Average Analyst Target Price (yahoo finance): **677.50** 

They have basically two segments. The first is research oriented providing reagents, apparatus, instruments and other stuff to organizations that do science (I.E. government agencies, pharmaceuticals, biotech, universities and medical schools and many other labs.) 

Second segment is their Clinical Diagnostics segment are test systems, informatics systems, and test kits. 

# You: Okay another COVID testing company what's so special?

Check this, the P/E is fucking 5.18 for a bio company.

# Boooo Boomer P/E discount strategy!!! 

Stfu, have you seen "strong earnings growth of **602.76%**"  since last quarter? JESUS. And it has earnings coming in **3 days.** 

[How do you even have net income that's greater than your total revenue?!?! I think it's because they didn't include it in their core activities. I invite you to check the statement.](https://preview.redd.it/7vyg3tp5dcg61.png?width=2553&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=184e125ad3674b80840b7361e158b9ce9daa8211)

# Are they making good money?

EPS (TTM) is 116.69, it's actually earning A LOT OF money compared to GME (GUH). I found this stock filtering for high earning companies because of my GME shares lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

# How do they fare against all the other bio testing stonks?

Let's see how many PCR machines they sell compared to others. IMO, it further highlights how absurdly discounted Bio-Rad is compared to other suppliers.

[These are from Thomas.net, an unbiased source talking about finding suppliers for various industries. See bio-rad on #9 top supplier. But Qiagen right above it at #8, trades at 67.29 PER \(yahoo finance\) compared to Bio-Rad's 5.18.](https://preview.redd.it/ikvfqh3njcg61.png?width=2085&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9e1e7fefa729e46a16c188660aa4b669142822e)

# So is Bio-rad actually selling equipment??

Let's ask the scientists.

A scientist chick called Mary Johnson at labome? (some weird science organization) analyzed how many science papers cited using Bio-rad / other suppliers to see what PCR equipment labs should buy. 

&gt; Three suppliers dominate the citations. They are Thermo Fisher, **Bio-Rad** (including brand MJ Research)  and Roche. The most cited models are Thermo Fisher 7x000 series, iCycler/MyIQ from **Bio-Rad** , and LightCycler from Roche. 

Scientists seem to love their bio-rads dude, so even if COVID testing goes away, sciencey lab big brains will still buy bio-rad products. 

# Technical Analysis:

[I don't know shit about crayons, draw your own conclusion. I wrote shit down on what I think it means. I am not your financial adviser.](https://preview.redd.it/ayy6tczsmcg61.png?width=1752&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f30bfcd8a779e8a04966313dea654a095a963b81)

# TLDR; $BIO is very undervalued compared to other COVID testing stocks and produces good lab equipment even for a post COVID age. MMM estimates plus/minus 39.097 move based on options pricing.

Title: ZOM DD
 Zomedica - $ZOM The company is developing potentially industry-changing products targeting the unmet needs in the field of veterinary health. Note they have a separate site for investors, a good sign that they will keep them in mind in the future.  
[https://investors.zomedica.com/](https://investors.zomedica.com/)

Current Price: $2.70 / share  
First and foremost, everyone loves their pets you will do what you can when you can and they are in need. I've heard horror stories from my local vet about back in 2008 when people took their dog in for diagnosis of symptoms and when the decision came to have samples sent to the lab for $200, hear back in 2 weeks, and still possibly not know the answer after, people passed it up due to the price and uncertainty. Zomedica developed a point-of-care device that tests for Thyroid/Adrenal disease in cats with a preloaded disposable cartridge.

In-Market:  
TRUFORMA, approved for March 2021, 2.7 Billion potential: Using Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) technology to diagnose diseases with precision from the resonant frequency measured. The device is the size of a shoebox for an extremely small footprint. The sample is taken and applied to a disposable cartridge for the specific assay with results in 20 minutes and then disposed of.

BAW technology: Basically using an electric field to excite acoustic waves resonating at a specific frequency that's comparable to a microwave. Slight changes in the frequency can be detected and correlated to a specific molecule known to be unique to the disease of interest. [https://www.tdx.cat/bitstream/handle/10803/5808/jvt1de1.pdf?sequence=1](https://www.tdx.cat/bitstream/handle/10803/5808/jvt1de1.pdf?sequence=1)

Pipeline: (now removed from their website after the TRUFORMA update)

1. Various other chips to test for dog and cat diagnostics. Common disease testing normally requires an entire lab full of UV, MS, IR, etc, all of which could soon be replaced with a single device the size of a shoebox that can be kept in the back closet.

Generic pharmaceutical drugs previously developed for human treatment that has gone through rigorous phase III clinical trials. Not only are the regulations much lower for veterinary drugs to reach commercial status, but many can also be used on animals as they target the same receptors. I'm sure we've all heard of that celebrity with the dog that suffers from anxiety which needs its 40 mg xanny bars, sureeeee. Anyways, being able to deliver generic drugs with zero cost for R&amp;D and little cost in safety/efficacy is a gold mine.

Staff:  
They hire experienced doctors in veterinary health with in-depth knowledge of the pitfalls in the field currently. I'm a science guy, for me (as long as they can run a business successfully), solid science is what really matters and that's how a company gets started in the health field.

Pros:  
Who doesn't love their pet? Unfortunately, they don't live as long us, but if you could cut down the cost and time for a diagnosis would you? I'm guessing every pet owner and Vet is saying yes. Now that they have received approval for their first diagnostic test, the concept has been proven and many more are soon to come.

Early investing opportunity in a company that has the potential to change not only veterinary diagnostics but human diagnostics as well. I imagine this won't take long to gain popularity in your local doctor's office once the potential is realized.

Cons:  
No earnings as TRUFORMA will be their first product to go to market.  
It's gotten pricey over the past week.

This is not investment advice. I like the stock, I like the science, I like to company.  
Don't turn this into a meme.

Title: Why Altria ($MO) LEAPs may have HUGE asymmetric upside 
**TL;DR: vaping, marijuana, Michael Burry, low as fuck IV, hugely under-valued company **

*\*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This is not investment advice. All information stated in this post is my own opinion, and some information may be unknowingly inaccurate or outdated. Please do your own due diligence before investing your money. I currently hold a long position on various Altria LEAPs.\**

Nicotine products have been in continuous use in North America for thousands of years [\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tobacco). Upon the arrival of the Spanish to the New World, tobacco use spread rapidly throughout the globe, becoming hugely popular not only across Europe, but also in far-flung Asia and the Ottoman Empire. The only comparable product to conquer the world so thoroughly is the ubiquitous, similarly addictive, mighty coffee bean.

By the 1900's, smoking had become a huge commercial enterprise. Glitz and glam surrounded the tobacco industry. All of your Grandmother's favorite actors smoked [\[2\]](https://www.dw.com/en/famous-smokers-on-screen/g-19021895). Many high schools had smoking lounges for the students (of course, your Nana still regularly snuck out behind the bleachers to have a private puff with the quarterback). Nicotine use was a normal and accepted part of life.

We are all, of course, familiar with the rest of the story. Studies came out showing just how damaging cigarette usage was on the human body. Campaigns were begun, laws were enacted, and Big Tobacco became Public Enemy #1 [\[3\]](https://www.thetruth.com/about-truth)

Fast forward to today. For the past few decades, despite decreasing cigarette volumes, the tobacco industry has remained immensely profitable. Big players in the cigarette industry have been able to compensate for declining cigarette volumes by raising prices. Cash flows from cigarette smoking have never been higher. Yet looking at the stock market performance of the tobacco industry over the past 5 years, you would think that the industry was on life support.

No company has lately fared worse than Altria ($MO). Despite growing income at a 5.9% CAGR since 2017 amid a backdrop of stabilizing declines in cigarette consumption [\[4\]](https://s25.q4cdn.com/409251670/files/doc_presentations/2021/01/28/Presentation.pdf), the company's stock remains 45% off its 2017 high. Much of the underperformance can be attributed to investors losing confidence in the company's management after a series of questionable investment decisions, including taking a 35% stake in JUUL, a 45% stake in Chronos (a Canadian marijuana company), and a 10% stake in Anheuser-Busch.

These investments have performed poorly over the past few years. High-profile teen deaths from illicit THC vaping products were widely linked to JUUL usage by our sensationalist media [\[5\]](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/e-cigarrettes-vaping-lung-injuries-deaths-top-science-stories-2019-yir), causing Altria to write-down its initial $12B investment in JUUL to a value of only \~$2B today. The bubble in the marijuana stock market popped in 2018, causing a 30% reduction in the value of Altria's Chronos stake. And the rise of the craft beer industry has continued to weigh on the profitability of Anheuser-Busch.

Despite the short-term pitfalls, I will argue that it is reasonable to believe that Altria has positioned itself very well for the future. And with all of these factors weighing down the stock over the past few years, I believe $MO is ripe for a turnaround.

**I have a 2023 price target for $MO of $90 which, given the low IV Altria enjoys, implies a 30x (3,000%) return on MO Jan 2023 65c LEAPs.**

My thesis relies on five key beliefs:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The company's core business is under-valued
2. Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes
3. Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized
4. Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO

&amp;#x200B;

**1) The Company's core business is under-valued**

Altria enjoys a stunningly low forward P/E of 8.7 and a stunningly high dividend yield of 8.1% [\[6\]](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MO). Various online discounted cash flow analyses of Altria give it an intrinsic value between $62-$72 [\[7\]](https://www.stock-analysis-on.net/NYSE/Company/Altria-Group-Inc/DCF/Present-Value-of-FCFF) [\[8\]](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-mo/altria-group/news/are-investors-undervaluing-altria-group-inc-nysemo-by-44). These analyses are very conservative in that they only take into account Altria's current business, which is predominantly smokeable tobacco products.

There are also bright spots in Altria's miscellaneous businesses that these DCF models don't account for, such as the fast-growing "on!" line of nicotine pouches, or the likely reinstatement of Anheuser-Busch's dividend after it was paused last year due to Covid.

We'll ignore these bright spots for now and give Altria's core business a conservative price target of $65.

**2) Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes**

*\*Please note: I am not a doctor. All health claims made in this post reflect only my own opinions.\**

Nicotine has gotten a bad rap in the past 50 years, but on its own there isn't much research I've seen to suggest it's any more dangerous than caffeine. The big problem with nicotine is simply the delivery mechanism. Smoking large amounts of anything is bad for your lungs. Vaping exposes your lungs to far fewer ancillary chemicals in much smaller doses than traditional smoking. For instance, Michael Blaha, M.D., M.P.H., director of clinical research at the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease, says about vaping theres almost no doubt that they expose you to fewer toxic chemicals than traditional cigarettes. [\[9\]](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/5-truths-you-need-to-know-about-vaping#:~:text=1%3A%20Vaping%20Is%20Less%20Harmful,many%20of%20which%20are%20toxic.)

Altria surveyed the landscape in 2017 and determined that acquiring a stake in JUUL was its best way to position itself for the future. Since then, JUUL's name has been dragged through the mud and associated with many teen deaths. However, these deaths were later determined to be caused by unauthorized THC products unlinked to JUUL [\[10\]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/10/25/cdc-most-people-who-died-vaping-linked-disease-used-products-containing-thc/). JUUL's case for harm reduction in the nicotine space is still intact.

The FTC filed an anti-trust case recently attempting to block Altria's stake in JUUL [\[11\]](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/191-0075/altria-groupjuul-labs-matter). This case is due to be heard this spring. The uncertainty around JUUL's future has weighed on $MO, but in my opinion all outcomes of this case are positive:

1. Altria is forced to divest its stake in JUUL

This is not ideal, but as part of the JUUL acquisition, Altria agreed to not compete in the vaping space against JUUL. If Altria is forced to divest, it can capitalize on the recent decline in the quality and brand value of JUUL (just check out r/juul to see the declining sentiment around the brand) to bring its own high-quality product onto the market.

2) Altria is allowed to keep its stake in JUUL

In this case, Altria can capitalize on JUUL's troubles by acquiring a larger stake in the company at a discount. Altria can then flood JUUL with the cash it needs to help rebuild its quality and brand. This is the ideal case in my opinion, for both JUUL and Altria.

Setting aside JUUL for the moment, Altria has the exclusive rights to distribute in the USA Phillip Morris's FDA-approved IQoS product [\[12\]](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/altria-and-philip-morris-iqos-3-device-wins-fda-ap/). This is a "heat not burn" product that is more similar to existing cigarettes than vaping, but still reduces the number of harmful chemicals inhaled. This product is already popular in Europe and Japan, and is just beginning to be marketed in the USA. One major advantage of this product is that it produces no smoke, and so may potentially end up being allowed in restaurants, bars, and offices.

**3) Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized**

Altria is the one company with the regulatory experience and distribution networks necessary to gain substantial market share in the nascent marijuana industry. Altria has been quietly filing patent after patent for THC and CBD vaping devices [\[13\]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisroberts/2020/10/02/tobacco-giant-altria-is-securing-technology-in-new-frontier-marijuana/). In fact, people in the fledgling marijuana industry are so worried about Altria's entry into the market that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, when speaking about his upcoming federal legalization bill, recently said "I dont want to see these big tobacco companies coming in and shoving everyone out" [\[14\]](https://mjbizdaily.com/senate-leader-chuck-schumer-pushing-federal-marijuana-legalization/). (Note however that, while this position may play well with Senator Schumer's base for now, having a marijuana industry that is run by well-established and responsible companies is ultimately the best outcome for public health, and so it is unlikely that any steps will be taken to bar Altria from competing in the free market of marijuana products).

**4) Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO**

Would this really be WallStreetBets if I didn't mention Michael Burry? Burry's fund Scion Asset Management had 5% of its portfolio in $MO as of Q3 2020, making Altria its 13th largest holding \[\[15\]([https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=SAM](https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=SAM)). For context, this is about half the weight that Michael Burry's fund had in GameStop during the same quarter.

If nothing else, this is a good sanity check on the analysis here.

**Summary**

In summary, it's likely that the true value of Altria's core business is closer to $65 than the current price of $43. Add on top of that the potential for success in the vaping category, and the potential for growth into the marijuana market, and it is easy to see $MO adding an additional 20-30B in market cap to reach a price of $90 by 2023.

IV for 2023 LEAPs sits at \~20%. MO Jan 2023 65c's are currently priced at $0.77. If Altria reaches $90 by 2023, these options will be worth at least $25. This would represent a &gt;3,100% return.

For this reason, I believe that Altria LEAPs represent a unique opportunity for asymmetric upside. Please let me know your thoughts below, I'd appreciate counter-arguments that highlight any flaws in the reasoning outlined above.

 Listen up all of you. This is a life changing stock I hope your ready for the mars mission we are about to begin this week. Bless all.

1 - The Company Itself

To start off with I have been holding since last October I absolutely love what they have done to expand their business recently. Last year they were focused heavily on weed (as in the plant) and not other forms it can be used in. Here are some links to what they have done:

[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sundial-announces-the-launch-of-premium-concentrates-products-under-its-top-leaf-brand-301205011.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sundial-announces-the-launch-of-premium-concentrates-products-under-its-top-leaf-brand-301205011.html)

Those are 2 product lines that will be introduced into their next earnings. Also, they are coming out with new strands for their product lines. Also if you know anything about Weed the profit margins on these 2 items are INSANE

Next is the fact they cleared all their debt. Yes, the shares were diluted when doing this, but this doesn't really matter if your buying after you read this. Also having no debt puts them in rumors of merging with a bigger company (Rumors are saying possible CGC) - I think its better they stay independent but ya.

Also SNDL basically owns Zenabus and Pathway RX and the medical mj market is BEYOND sleep on its unreal.

THIS COMPANY IPO'd AT 13 BTW - Weed Sector is bigger and more promising than it has ever been at expect this to hit 15 Range Soon!

Also when US is legal I think SNDL gets the largest market share in the US their brands are fire. I do believe this stock to be the amazon of weed

2 - The Hedge Fund Shorts - SHORT SQUEEZE OPPORTUNITY

These Hedge Funds tried to run this stock into the ground and make people lose jobs just because they wanted more money. Just in December 2020 they increased short interest by almost 2000%. These guys piled on them because SNDL was saved by NASDAQ (SNDL was supposed to be delisted in dec. but given till June by Nasdaq) since the EXCHANGE even noticed that this stock was being manipulated. Here's where I got this info

[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SNDL/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SNDL/short-interest/)

This gives way for a very very possible short squeeze (yes i know its not similar to GME, however, this short interest will be nice to add on to the momentum that will take us to mars)

3- Robinhood Stopped Trading/ HF manipulation

I think this needs to moon for this reason alone. This was one of the stocks attacked by Wallstreet and RH as they thought they could get it delisted for basically no reason. Today's attack was the beginning of the war with the 1%. The company fundamentally is worth more than where they are at and the hype included will make this a real rocketship.

Also when this is posted 2/8 over the weekend almost all articles written and displayed first after looking up SNDL and click news are beyond bearish its unreal. The authors just say a bunch of crap that could easly be disproven or explained. These HF are paying media outlets to try to make people sell. This is a long term play btw as SNDL will eat the entire market up and be worth $100 in about 3/4 years so

Please Feel free to share more info you guys have as this isn't too in-depth

POSITIONS: 7/16 1.5c

Title: (CLNE) DD. The path of least resistance, and most gains.
**Alright retards, it's time to get into the next biggest movement in our lifetime and make some no brainer tendies, Clean Energy. (CLNE) **

This is not financial advice, do your own DD before investing. Yada yada. 

I have made huge gains over the course of my time on this sub, upwards of $400,000. I consider myself a heavy weight investor ready to put in my next bet. I feel this is important so you can understand the weight of my conviction I have for this company.

**Clean Energy Fuels Corp** is a company that prides itself in being one of the leading providers of clean fuel for the transportation market in North America. 

As of right now they are currently involved in:

* Regional Fleets of Trucks

* Commercial Airlines

* Public Transit

* Construction Vehicles

* Ships/Cargo Boats/Vessels/Cruise Lines

**Argument #1**

Undervalued. At it's current price of $17 a share and 600% price movement over the last 3 months, it's a no brainer that this will continue to climb this year. [3 month graph](https://imgur.com/BNB6mnx) 

**Financials**

* Market Cap - 2.94B

* P/E Ratio - 79.62 

* Cash on Hand - 96 million

What causes a companies value to go up? The potential for future catalysts. With Biden in presidency, CLNE is a huge candidate for getting a large piece of the clean energy stimulus and providing eco friendly alternatives across North America. It's reign has just begun.  



**Argument #2**

Biden plans to pump $2 trillion into clean energy alternatives. He plans on creating 10 million jobs in clean energy sectors. He's only been in office since January 20th, the momentum will pick up shortly don't miss the rocket. If you read [President Biden's Plan to build a sustainable clean energy future](https://joebiden.com/climate-labor-fact-sheet/) you will immediately understand why this is one of the clearest investments to make right now

 **TLDR:** Biden will make **far reaching** investments into clean energy transit methods by reducing fuel emissions in public and commercial transit systems.

While Electric Vehicles are definitely the long long long term play.  **Clean Energy Fuels Corp** is the realistic solution in a shorter period of time to achieve Biden's goals.

**Argument #3**

The recent hype and growth of the opportunities in Clean Energy are very apparent with the large stimulus packages including a lot of subsidies for clean energy companies. The company itself has recently been partnering with well-known industry leaders that want to be first-movers in the space to transition to greener consumption of transportation.

The [CEO, Andrew Littlefair](https://imgur.com/eKOQD7Z) owns 0.7% of shares outstanding. Current shares outstanding are 198M, and of this, the CEO himself owns approximately 1.38 million shares. He definitely believes in the company!

**Price Targets**

I believe the momentum for this company is just beginning. $40 by June, and $65 by end of year are my conservative estimates. Today we saw a 40% price movement because of a deal made with [LA transit bus systems](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-alert%3A-clean-energy-fuels-corp.-adds-30-after-striking-deal-with-la-metro-2021-02-08?amp)

The potential for e-commerce companies, transit systems, airports, shipping companies and trading ports converting to Clean Fuels is a huge game changer and allow for *MANY* more catalysts in the future. The surface has only just been scratched.

[My position, $30,000 in shares](https://imgur.com/UE6y8Qx) Yes I bought at the top, today. I'm sure this is only the beginning. I will add more to my positions later to average down and add some leaps as well.

**TLDR** CLNE is the future. Expect a 400% increase over the next 6 to 12 months. 

Title: BioNano Genomics - Why you should care about it
First of all, I'm not a financial advisor and I like certain stocks more than others.

I was skeptical about investing in [BioNano Genomics](https://bionanogenomics.com/products/) after the run-up which saw that share price move from **$0.50 to $10 in two months**. But, I got interested - I read, and I read, and I followed what the scientists were saying, the results of their tech, and I got hooked.

Without going into the science which won't mean much to most of us - it's a company that runs human genome mapping at scale, and allows doctors to detect genetic variants which can lead to new cancer treatments, and a bunch of other cool stuff that reads like science fiction, but is become more and more a reality.

I became a believer after seeing this - they are helping solve children leukemia, for crying out loud:

[Dr. Gordana R. from Children's Hospital Los Angeles Presents Findings That Show Saphyr Detects Druggable Genetic Fusions in Pediatric Acute Leukemias  ...](https://ir.bionanogenomics.com/?qmodStoryID=4789689684773596)

That story is from their [investors website](https://ir.bionanogenomics.com). There are many others.

Analysts are starting to like them more and more, because of the promise of a $100 genome map:

[If analysts raise PT to $15, market is probably gonna take it to $30](https://preview.redd.it/4hecjqm6hbg61.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b0edb1352e0c7e254b4834bffa2a2c1b2d6b979)

There's plenty of speculation on whether or not ARKG is going to take them on, but honestly, I don't really care. People over at r/BNGO seem to love to debate that, but, personally, I really believe that this is going to enable next generation cancer treatments and move the needle in medicine overall, that I plan to HODL this for years, whatever happens.

Finally, here are my positions. It's not much, but I'm working on it. I sold far dated puts to collect cash premium and invest it into shares. I described that here, if you're interested: [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BNGO/comments/lada1i/selling_bngo_puts_for_shares_update/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

*Processing img wmys3wq3hbg61...*

I don't want to speculate about price going to $X in Y months, so I can't suggest any long calls and I don't know if you'll make 10x on this in a month. Probably not, and there's risk here like in anywhere else. Also, I know, this is not r/investing and I should fuck off and take my shit there. That's fine too. I'll just leave this here and people can decide if they want to buy in or not.

Thanks and good luck to us all!

Title: Since many of us left RH, more penny prospects are open. So here it is. $PHBI, making moves.
 In for 40k shares and thought I would share some decent info. This is not a MEME stock but I guess it can become one. Either way its a solid company.

Pharmagreen Biotech Inc ($PHBI) is currently trading at $0.055 and could fly up to $0.20 by the end of the week and $1.25-$1.75 by the end of the year. This looks to be both a good long and short term play.

About:

Pharmagreen Biotech, Inc., a Nevada company, publicly traded (OTC PINKS: PHBI), through, its wholly owned subsidiaries in U.S. and Canada, plans on becoming one of largest producers of hemp starter plantlets through a proprietary tissue culture process.

Title: Calling all Bagholders - How to make money off your bags while you hold them and stop losses (writing calls and collars for dummies)
Alright you dumb apes, I'm tired of watching you all slowly lose money hoping for another black swan event. If you won't sell, you can at least hedge while you hold to zero.

Many of you are new to this and the vast majority here don't know how to sell anything. Since you love your $AMC, $GME and other meme stonks so much, how about writing/selling calls against them?

What does it mean to write/sell a call? You pick a strike price (not $1000, sorry). The strike price is the price you agree to part with your beloved meme stonks should the price go up bigly again (it won't). You pick the expiration date of the contract. Someone pays you a premium for this, represented as dollars per share. Right now a March 19th $100 strike call is selling for $12.80 a share, or $1,280 in premium. This lowers your cost basis as you get the premium no matter what happens.

If your meme stonk falls, the contract loses value and you can buy it back and sell another if you want. Point is, you make money if the price falls which you aren't currently doing sitting on your shares.

Now for the really smart apes here, you could use the call premium to buy a put and create what's called a collar. A $45 put for instance goes for $1,215 in March. So you would no longer lose money below $45 as you carefully diamond hand your way to oblivion. And it wouldn't cost you anything since the $1,280 call premium covers the $1,215 put cost. You'd even have enough leftover to buy your wife and her boyfriend a mediocre dinner.

Now, this only works for those of you hodling at least 100 shares and of course having a broker which will let you trade options. If you don't have that many shares, sorry. Options contracts trade in blocks of 100 shares.

This is the beauty of options - the ability to hedge your positions as well as speculate. Because if you don't hedge your funds, you might be a Melvin.

Title: GEVO basically free money with Biden in office
I got into GEVO when it was $1,70. I hold 5000 shares. I tried telling you about it, but I got banned because the market cap was below 1 billion. Well now it's above 2 billion and GEVO is above $12, but let me tell you. This baby still has \*a lot\* of upside.

GEVO's co-CEO just won the nobel price in chemistry and guess what, she's also on Biden's science advisory board \[1\]\[2\]. Now what are they actually doing? They're making jet fuel from plants. Fucking jet fuel. Do you realize, this is the only available way to make planes "clean" in the foreseeable future? This will only change once batteries are dense enough to make electric planes - we're not there and even if we'd come up with the technology tomorrow, it'd still take many years to replace all planes. And it gets even better. They hold a patent on this tech, so only they can do it \[3\].

GEVO is still a small cap, but they can totally play along XOM (200 billion), Shell (120 billion) or BP (74 billion). Worst case at this point is that they will stay where they are, I just don't see how the stock could go down given the circumstances - the next 4 years will be smooth sailing under Biden. This might very well be one of his big projects.

Title: Lucira Health Inc (LHDX) - FDA approved Home Covid test kit developer IPO
**Summary:**

Founded in 2013, Lucira had already developed a single-use kit to diagnose influenza when it shifted gears to focus on SARS-CoV-2 detection in the COVID-19 pandemic. In November, the company won emergency use authorization (EUA) from the U.S. FDA for its [COVID-19 All-in-One Test Kit](https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/pharmaceutical-science/biopharma-reporter.com/article/2020/11/18/fda-authorises-first-covid-19-home-self-testing-kit/11954738-3-eng-GB/FDA-authorises-first-COVID-19-home-self-testing-kit.jpg), making it the first prescription molecular diagnostic test for the SARS-Cov-2 virus that can be performed from start to finish in the comfort of ones home.


**Technicals**

* After winning emergency use authorisation in the FDA, the company is expecting billions of orders in the U.S, Europe &amp; Asia.

* The [Covid test kids](https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/pharmaceutical-science/biopharma-reporter.com/article/2020/11/18/fda-authorises-first-covid-19-home-self-testing-kit/11954738-3-eng-GB/FDA-authorises-first-COVID-19-home-self-testing-kit.jpg) are one use only so expect a continious stream of these. The company has also developed it to work on all mutations of the Corona virus strain so as more mutations come up, expect more demand to rise.

This stock is cheap at the moment but expect it to moon soon.

Title: The Bull Case for CLNE: A Stepping Stone to the Future
This is my first DD post so please forgive me. I know there was another CLNE DD a bit ago but I just wanted to post mine as well since I was working on it lol.

**What is CLNE?**

Since this is pretty googleable information, I'll keept it short. CLNE provides natural gas solutions for transportation throughout the US and Canada. They started out with compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquified natural gas (LNG), which are both good, but more importantly now have renewable natural gas (RNG). They sell RNG under the name Redeem and you can read all about it [here](https://redeem.cleanenergyfuels.com/) The important thing here is that RNG is carbon negative.

CLNE also has a large infrastructure for natural gas refueling. They currently have a shitload of stations around the US and Canada, which is great because the candiates for using natural gas most are things like 18 wheelers and other stuff that just make big long trips. It's too bad for them that they were so early, because no one was using natural gas till more recent times (unless you look at other countries, but...).

CLNE is also on a recent uptrend after [getting an upgrade from Credit Suisse to $17.](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/02/19463411/credit-suisse-initiates-coverage-on-clean-energy-fuels-with-outperform-rating-announces-price-target)

**Why Natural Gas?**

As I mentioned before, RNG is carbon negative. More and more commercial vehicles are being converted to natural gas use in order to reduce carbon footprint (70% decrease according to CLNE's own website). More companies are going to be converting their vehicles to use natural gas (in fact, Amazon is already making the move [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-engines-natural-gas-exclusive/exclusive-amazon-orders-hundreds-of-trucks-that-run-on-natural-gas-idUSKBN2A52ML)). This is an easy stepping stone right now, since doing electric fleets is a non-trivial matter (but will eventually happen). In fact, RNG has a lower carbon rating than electric batteries, [according to Commiefornia's Air Resource Board](http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/17518/rng-helps-reach-carbon-negative-milestone-in-california). With demand for natural gas ramping up in the transportation sector, who else but CLNE who provides both RNG and the facilities to refuel with more, which are already established.

**Increasing Natural Gas Demand**

Companies are not changing their fleets to start using natural gas out of the goodness of their hearts. With Buyden now in office, we can expect more sweeping green policies. Most of these policies in the past have focused on a carbon tax, which means carbon intensive fuels will get more expensive. I'd imagine you also get a tax credit for going carbon-negative (hey there's that word again), [which RNG will assist with](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-lauds-passage-of-alternative-fuel-tax-credit-by-congress).

We also see an increase in demand for RNG happening right now. [CLNE last December reported signing deals for 58 million gallons of RNG](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-signs-deals-for-over-58-million-gallons-of-redeem-tm-renewable-natural-gas-to-meet-growing-demand-for-carbon-neutral-fuel-01608030439?tesla=y), which is quite good because in the entirety of 2019 [they only sold 143 million gallons](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-delivers-143-million-gallons-of-redeem-renewable-natural-gas-in-2019-a-30-jump-from-last-year-strong-finish-in-transit-and-solid-waste)

[Lastly, we have new trucks coming in that run on natural gas from Volvo and more](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2020/11/08/natural-gas-vehicles-are-making-inroads-and-want-joe-biden-to-get-aboard/?sh=34de9bfb2d5e). I believe we will continue to see more companies move to natural gas fleets which will continuously pump this stock.

**Partnerships**

CLNE has entered partnerships with BP and has an upcoming one with Total. With BP, [they are joint owning and operating RNG facilities](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-to-make-more-carbon-negative-fuel-available-for-transportation-with-bp-01608567431?tesla=y). With BP that will share half the control, and BP fronted $50 million to fund the costs of the join venture. 

With Total [they have a memorandum of understanding](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-and-total-to-develop-additional-carbon-negative-fuel-and-infrastructure-01608548752?tesla=y) to develop more RNG infrastructure. They will similarly be having a 50/50 joint venture, with more support coming from Total. I believe Total is providing $50 million as well for this venture, with an additional credit support of $60 million. 

These deals were fairly recent, so CLNE is on the upswing here with big oil coming in and backing them up for natural gas.

**Expansion**

Well, CLNE was already early to natural gas infrastructure, much to their detriment to be honest. Luckily it's paying off now. I would think they would continue to expand with more refueling stations, and more ways to produce RNG (the joint ventures seem to be pointing in this direction so that's good).

I know there have been some rumblings for an expansion into Hydrogen, which honestly would be huge if their refueling stations can support that. However after talking to some people more familiar with hydrogen fuel, this might be unlikely. Apparently swapping natural gas infrastructure to also support hydrogen is not easy, on account of the fact that hydrogen is pretty liable to explode, plus some other issues (like leaching issues??). I would actually hope they DON'T expand into this area because I believe what they have is currently very strong, and hydrogen stations themselves are negative ROI. 

**The Numbers**

Honestly these don't look bad and if you want me to map this out more I'll do it if there's interest. I'm too lazy to do detailed analysis on this right now though.

**The Play**

As more news comes out this stock will pump further and further. If you want to get a small position you can do that now, and then just load up on any dips. I do expect retracement from today's price a bit. Conservative price target is $22 by Summer, and the bull target is $60 end of year. 

[I am holding 50 contracts of 3/19 $13c, and 50 contracts of 6/18 $17c which I purchased last week (These are printing hard). I also hold 7500 shares at a cost basis of around ~$6.](https://i.ibb.co/CJM6fDY/image.png) I will personally probably roll half my 3/19 $13c's into  4/16 $17c or something like that. I still think CLNE is a strong play and will be adding to my positions.

Title: All good things must come to an end. MARKET CRASH DD. (first time Gbear)
 

THE BAD

The stock market it at an all time high amidst a global pandemic. The dollar continues to lose value and j papa Powell says he now just plans to let inflation run above 2% standard(to put this into context u can understand 1 dollar in 1900(gold standard) is now equal to 31$ today). Over the last 60 years fed debt to GDP ratio has remained under 59% but is currently at 130%(more than double). Understand that the US government does not work for you, they are there own independent banking system and will cover there own butt at ur expense. Mortgage delinquency are currently higher then they where in 2008 housing crises. US credit card debt also has hit an all time high of around 930B and is continuing to rise. New data has shown us that nearly 100k business have closed since the pandemic started and around 160k more claim they could also be forced to close as well. Since the start of the pandemic stonks have only gone up, but you must understand that some evals of company's are getting rather ridiculous. Consider tesla at its current evaluation it would need 1600 years to pay back the share value its at right now.

2008 and today

in 2008 everyone and there brother was a contractor as real-estate was at an all time high. today everyone and there brother is a stock trader and investor or a retarded autist if u will. This should make u worry. When my frat bro friends suddenly takes up an interest in trying to bankrupt a brokerage my autistic equivalent of spidy senses go off.

THE UGLY

You must understand that in this battle to destroy these hedge funds you the retail trader does not come out on top. This country and especially this market is made for the rich and built on the poor. Have you ever wondered why ur shares are fdic insured in ur chosen brokerage. that's because these brokerages can barrow against your positions and short them. seriously google its disgusting.

THE GOOD

if you agree with what I have stated above you can hedge against a market crash and survive to trade another day.

POSSSIBLE PLAYS

digital currency play-  spread you money out amongst the top 15 coins and you should do just fine for yourself. if you want something on the market look into greyscale they have a bunch of trusts that are good bets as well if ur bullish on coins

commodities - GC, AGQ, ZC(children of the corn), NG, all of these are pretty safe bets

indices and etf's - short upro, call spxu, call sqqq, call faz

bet against the dollar(you know the thing that continues to lose value since 1900) - calls on UDN

CLOSING

yolo these if ya want lord knows I cant stop u. personally I would say to just use this info to hedge against a possible market crash. in the mean time before the crash we should see stocks rip so don't sell all ur positions right now to buy this stuff.

TL:DR retail owns 36% of the market where as hedge funds own 3%. smart money is in cash maybe you should be to.

Title: DD - Patience is a Virtu
Well done. Somehow, against all odds, a large number of you autistic fucks have made some life changing gains on GME. This post is in no way encouraging you to sell your positions or even open new ones. Thats because I'm not a fiduciary advisor and know fuck all about what you should or shouldn't do. All I will say is welcome to all the new members out there and if there's one piece of advice I can give you, its to trust your gut.



Now lets get into it. This post is my DD that I wanted to share on $VIRT, not because I am recommending you to do anything, but because I enjoy researching shit because its fun and I figured this would help organize my thoughts. 



So lets get into it. I'm sure most of you have noticed the new exposure this sub has been getting on a worldwide scale. If you've been here even since Dec. in 2020, you'd notice this sub has even gained over 6M subscribers in the last month. I'm not going to tell you I've been around since the start, I've just been lurking and a post or comment every once and a while since I started following a few years ago. The sub count really means fuck all to be honest, the real numbers that are important here are the #'s of new retail traders joining the markets while bringing in new money by doing so. Give this Reuters article a quick read (promise it will only take 5 minutes, 10 if you're a true retard): https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-numbers-idUSKBN29Y2PW




For those who are lazy fucks who don't want to open the article: with no fee trading, retail traders have flooded the market. To what extent you may ask, and why the fuck does this matter? Well back in Jan 2020, before the March crash, retail made up ~17% of trades on the market. By July/August, this shot up to 25%. Some analyst in this article noted their prediction for 2021 is 30%+ of volume will be made up of retail. **THE TREND IS INCREASING** for those of you who couldn't pass your 2nd grade math class. So why did i even mention GME to start? Well according to an analyst from Piper Sandler, this past Wednesday set a new record for volume traded for US cash equities of **24.5 Billion** . Thats volume traded, not a $ amount. Options volume also hit a record high in volume at 57.1 Million. For both stocks and options, this supposedly is double the record in volume traded in a single day from 2020, or triple in 2019. One last important #, its estimated amongst the top 6 brokers, there are 100 Million+ retail traders. **100 Million** thats a fuck ton of regular Joes' and retards joining the game gambling away their $600 stimulus checks. 



TLDR: Retail trading #s are going the fuck up, and fast. This in turn mean a fuck ton more volume traded on the market.



OK Cool. Why does this matter? Well aside from Melvin Securities (Melvin Capitals Market Maker/scum of the earth), there are other Market Makers that do the same thing (provide liquidity to brokers allowing autists like us to buy and sell stocks and options). Companies like $VIRT, Virtu Financial, that are publicly traded. Lets take a look at the breakdown of trading volume across market makers, Brokers, Liquidity providers etc:


https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BjrX0/1/



$VIRT has showed a consistent increase in trading revenue and EPS since their IPO in 2015. This growth is due to various synergies on their platform from previous buyouts, volume spikes (due to volatility) and you guessed it, an increased amount of retail trading. According to their 2019 full year report, they supported approximately ~30% of all retail trading. This is up from 25% the previous year. 
https://s21.q4cdn.com/422114427/files/doc_financials/2019/ar/Virtu_2019_AnnualReport_Final.pdf



Ok so why does all this matter, if this trend in increased retail trading continues, that means more trading income for $VIRT. And turn, higher earnings. Why? This is because those Ask/Bid spreads you see when buying/selling are typically provided through market makers. They make money off of these spreads. 1 cent here or there, maybe a little more for wider spreads times **millions** of trades/day equals out to big money for them. An even bigger wet dream would be if Melvin Securities went under and that portion of the market making sector being open for the taking. Then again, that probably won't happen but regardless **Fuck Melvin**.



So what else? $VIRT has provided a $0.24 dividend for **22 consecutive quarters** and also announced $100 million in buy backs on their Q3 report released in Nov 2020, also making a statement to "meaningfully enhance shareholder returns" with additional buybacks and dividends moving forward. And a shout out to the true gambling addicts who love earnings plays, $VIRT has earnings coming up on **Feb 11th**. Thats this Thursday. Lets even take a look at their revenue growth. According to their 2019 full year report, Virtu took in $1.5B in revenues. Fast forward to the first 3 quarters of 2020, that totals over $2.5B and we still even haven't seen Q4 results yet. While yes, the volume in March/April played a part in this, Q3 revenues were still over $650M, which is still over a third of the full 2019 year. Their current market cap is only ~**$5.4B** with a PE of **6.6**. Talk about nice returns. Time to bet on the Casino instead sitting down at the fucking roulette table. 



TLDR: More retail trading = more $$ for market makers like $VIRT

Title: February Pharma bets for gambling degenerates
For WSB noobs: pharma stocks usually jump or dive after binary (success/failure) events such as drug trial results coming out or FDA approvals.

The size of the move depends mainly on two things:

\- The market cap of the company: for a huge company like JNJ, any event will generate only a tiny move, whereas the value of a penny stock can +10x after a successful event.

\- Size of the addressable market: does the drug treat a rare disease or a common one? The larger the size of the market, the larger the move would be.

Drug approvals are a long process that can take years, but in some instances, the FDA grants priority date to certain drugs. These are referred to as PDFDA events.

Here's a list of the ones (with market cap &gt; 1 billion to avoid my post being removed) coming up this month:

I have added what the drug does (from a quick google search) + addressable market size (basically just my intuition, without any data to support):

11 Feb 21 [$REGN](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/REGN) Evinacumab (high cholesterol), addressable market: medium  
15 Feb 21 [$GTHX](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/GTHX) Trilaciclib (designed to improve outcomes of patients who receive chemotherapy), addressable market: large  
25 Feb 21 [$SRPT](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/SRPT) Casimersen (Duchenne muscular dystrophy), addressable market: small  
28 Feb 21 [$REGN](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/REGN) Libtayo (metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma), addressable market: small  
28 Feb 21 [$BPMC](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/BPMC) Pralsetinib (metastatic RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer), addressable market: small  
28 Feb 21 [$ATNX](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ATNX) Oral Paclitaxel (metastatic breast cancer), addressable market: large

My positions:

I have invested some money only in SRPT and ATNX. In SRPT, because it had a high drop recently and I hope an approval will trigger a recovery. ATNX because I think the treatment being in the form of a pill is a winner. I haven't researched the rest.

SRPT 100C 3/19 \[[screenshot](https://ibb.co/gvXfy9x)\]  
ATNX 15C 3/19 + Shares \[[screenshot](https://ibb.co/jvB6DSg)\]

As mentioned, these are bets, with odds probably better than 50%. I'm not a financial advisor!

Title: DD: Financial sectors within emerging markets
Okay retards. I know most of you cant read but this sub has been seriously lacking in the DD department. 
  
  The WSB I subbed to is not the same as the WSB today, so for the newbies: GME NOK BB   . For everyone else:
  
  Within the global economy, there are several emerging markets. Asia, Africa, and Latin America have experienced and are on the cusp of unprecedented growth. Pretty much every industry is booming, but not every industry is easy to invest in. 
  
  The three fastest growing industries within these countries (mainly Brazil, North/ South Africa, SE Asia) are consumer products, infrastructure and development, and financial infrastructure. Consumer goods and development are extremely segmented industries; it would be almost impossible to dependably buy stocks that cover a large market share. However, due to corruption and ease of communication with foreign entities, the banking industries within these countries are fairly centralized. 
  
  The banks I have mainly been looking at are BDORY (Brazil), SGBLY (South Africa), IBN (India), among others. Most of these banks havent fully recovered from the initial coronavirus drop so if youre like me, and think pretty much every US stock is overpriced, this could be the play for you. For consumer products, my play is Coca-Cola. These are long term plays so dont expect 30% in two days. Of course, invest at your own risk.

Title: While you were busy arguing about GME, I studied the blade. Daddy Elon is using it. Mommy C. Wood is buying it. Grandpa Gamma wants to squeeze it. You need to try it.
What is the blade you ask? It is the sword that we live and die by. It is the ultimate high-risk, high-reward investment.

What if I told you that theres a single company, currently valued at **0.01** trillion dollars, that has an actual possibility to grow into a **1.02** trillion dollar market cap company?

Lets look at the companies it can steal money from:

* Its a social media replacement. FB is worth 763 billion.

* Its a Zoom replacement. ZM is worth 122 billion.

* Its a podcasters paradise. SPOT is worth 58 billion.

* Its a personal trainer platform. PTON is worth 43 billion.

* Its a dating app platform. MTCH (maker of tinder) is worth 42 billion.

* Its a language learning platform. Rosetta Stone and Duolingo are worth about 1.4 billion.

Add that all up and you get **1.0294 trillion dollars.** Thats 100x the companys current value. Will it get all the way there? I dont know. This isnt WallStreetFinancialAdvice.

Oh, I forgot:

* They also do telemedicine or some shit (literally worth an arm and a leg).

What company are we talking about? Agora (ticker: API).

Do you remember when Gmail was invite-only? You should have invested in GOOG back then.

Do you remember when FB was invite-only? You should have invested in FB back then.

Guess whats invite-only now? Clubhouse. Thats the app that Elon Musk used to roast Vlad Tenev of Robinhood. Its a platform for audio-only chatrooms. It cant effectively be described with textyou have to try it. Did you ever marry someone because of her tinder bio description? (the answer is no. hopefully. some things just can't be explained via text.)

I saw some articles about Clubhouse a couple days ago, and I thought yeah yeah whatever. New social media thing. I was a Facebook guy, never got the hype about Snapchat, now lots of people are moving away from Snapchat, I bet this Clubhouse thing will pass too.

Holy fuck I was wrong. Theres really nothing I can write about Clubhouse to make you think its good. You just have to try it. **Anyone else who has used the app, please comment below with your honest review.**

The nice thing about the app is that it just fucking worksno lag, no choppy audio, no bullshit. Its just effortless. Zoom, Discord, Skype, and all their competitors suck a big fat donkey dick compared to Clubhouse. 

I literally use Clubhouse 16+ hours per day. My girlfriend fucking hates it.

But Clubhouse is ackshuallllly just a User Interface. The true magic sauce in this tasty tendie basket is the audio-processing platform. Agora (API) makes this software, and they charge Clubhouse a certain rate per 1000 minutes of use.

Think about that for a minute. The more you use Clubhouse (yes, you! the person reading this!) the higher Agoras revenue goes, and the higher Agoras stock price will go for its stockholders (again! this could be you! You could be a stockholder!).

This is like buying Xboxes at GameStop, except you dont have to buy anything, you just have to use a fun app (which you are going to get addicted to anyway).

API has Clubhouse by the balls. Nobody, I repeat, NOBODY would use Clubhouse if it was laggy, choppy, or full of microphone issues. API is the rainmaker, the money printer, and the rocket fueller. Theres a gold rush right now and API patented the fucking pickaxe. Maybe a competitor can match them. Maybe Bing will be better than Google some day. Who knows.

Using the platform for the first time feels like youve been living in a 56k dialup world, downloading Mr. Wilson from Castaway themed porn (frame by frame), when suddenly the clouds part and the two co-founders of Agora (both named Tony) hand you a StarLink-powered 8k Jumbotron pre-loaded with Mia Khalifas greatest hits and the new Spongebob movie: Sponge on the Run.

Its good shit. 

Its addictive. Do a web search (yes, do a web search with google, that search engine that you should have invested in back in 2006) for a graph of the user growth. Clubhouses membership is literally exploding faster than WSBs members did during peak GameStop mania. You are going to be reading a LOT of articles about Clubhouse in the next few months. You dont wanna be fucking late.

That said, youre not early to the party. The stock gained $50 last week, closing around $100. All call strikes were ITM. Theyre making new strikes up to $135. Theres a serious chance that these strikes could expire ITM as well, yielding a gamma squeeze. It's up about 8% right now. no big deal.

This party could go on a long time. The market cap is only $10 bn right now. Back when Google was a 10bn company, if you had invested $10k, you would have $1,420,000.00 now.

Yes, I just compared API to Google. Why? Because tech matters. Google was just a search engine back in the early 2000s. It grew because it was the best search engine. Agora makes audio processing platforms. It is BY FAR the best. Work from home is here to stay. Audio is fucking important.

Clubhouse might stick around, or it might be the next MySpace, idk. But whatever audio-chatroom app takes their place will have to pay Agora to use the audio processing software. Cha-ching. (Oh, and Agoras voice and video platforms work in a million other industries too, like telemedicine, which might be useful since theres a pandemic).

Cathie Woods threw a fuckton of money at Agora shares to get them in her ARKW etf. Additionally, unusual options trackers noticed that some big fat whale bought a fuckton of calls with the highest strike, $135. Some very smart people like the stock.

Do your own research, dont gamble more than youre willing to lose, and try out the Clubhouse app for yourself. Its invite-only right now but you can join the waiting list and it might let you join in a couple days. Its iPhone only right now.

Againif youve used Clubhouse, please post a review below. And if you have questions or concerns about Agora (API) post them below as wellI get all my info from the internet and I want to know if I missed something.

Title: Im an actual Aspie, and a Product Manager in Digital Entertainment. Here is a copy of my DD based e-Mail to GMEs Investor Relations. Please dont delete, this took work.
EDIT: I read the comments, yet I have no regrets.

Dear Department of Investor Relations at GameStop,
Dear valued ladies and gentlemen of the board,

Remember how Apple was doing, while Jobs was at Pixar?

My name is Ralf Kraemer, I am a citizen of Germany, and I currently hold several shares of $GME.
Last week, when I was one of the first to leave a message with this request on the answering machine attached to the investor relations phone number, I held 2 shares, but since I believe in this company, I am now holding 7. I am also an experienced product manager in the tech and media industry, having worked with companies such as Amazon and WarnerMedia, mostly in the digital entertainment sector.

I have personally mobilized hundreds of shareholders, possibly thousands by now, many of whom are holding much more than I am, hoping to be heard.
With eCommerce and eSports on the rise, gaming having reached the main stream and the games industry even outperforming Hollywood these days, the potential of GameStop as a company and brand is undeniable.
Many doubted the potential of Apple and Amazon in their early days, TV and the internet were laughed off as hypes, and Galilei was almost burnt at the stake for suggesting the earth is round.
Lets take a step back and a deep breath, before looking at the actual big picture:
- The games industry will continue to grow for at least a decade, likely much longer
- GameStop has the brand awareness, cash assets and partnerships required to reposition itself in the market
- The idea of turning GameStop into a chain of cultural hot spots isnt new, but still viable
- A GameStop eSports team and some new corporate partnerships, with the likes of Epic Games, Riot Games and Valve, could revitalize the company
- The current GameStop leadership team has failed to effectively adapt to change for half a decade
- Synthetic longs and shady market manipulation tactics are currently threatening all GME shareholders and their livelihoods
- The total number of outstanding shares is relatively low when compared to other successful companies in the tech and media industry, rendering attempts at reliable valuation laughable, especially in light of potential growth
- Announcing an emergency shareholder meeting would not only eliminate all synthetic stock, but also send a signal that GameStop is ready and willing to make a turn for the better

Please urgently consider having current shareholders vote on the following:
- Performance review and potential replacement of the incumbent C-suite
- A 2:1 stock split for better availability of GameStop shares to potential investors
- A strategic change of direction toward a more digital and more transcendent positioning in the market, with less focus on retail, and more focus on partnerships and the cultural aspects of gaming
- The appointment of a new board member to represent retail investors
- A further increase in diversity in the board room and the executive management level, to better represent fans and consumers, as well as to indicate an increased willingness to learn from the past and adapt to the future

I do believe that Mr Sherman deserves to stay involved as a CEO, but ultimately this is for shareholders to decide. The same goes for the strategic orientation of the company.
You may disagree with each and every point I am trying to make, but with all due respect: You are biased.
If no immediate action is taken, GameStop may not see another annual shareholder meeting. We have only just scratched by the risk of bankruptcy, but we have the potential of outperforming many of our competitors.
I have many ideas for how this could be achieved, that I will happily share with you, should you get back to me with questions. As a millennial with 7 years of professional experience in the digital consumer space, I am confident in my ability to provide advice.
Should you decide take the steps outlined above, GameStop could easily realign itself with the industrys growth, possibly bringing the stocks actual value near the maximum price it had in January of this year, even after a split. Always remember, that not every high value stock in the market has started out as a unicorn, and many have seen darker times than this one. I can not stress enough, what I already stated at the beginning: Remember how Apple was doing, while Jobs was at Pixar?

Yours sincerely,

Ralf Kraemer

Title: Feb 9th GME Short Interest Data
I have some theories about the  short interest data coming out 2/9 that will include shorts that have settled by 1/29. 

If shorts settle T+2, and its only reporting shorts settled by 1/29, that would be trades executed 1/27 or before.  Missing any data from that Thursday fuckery by Robinhood etc and the following Friday with the all time high. 

Between 1/14-1/21 it traded in a very tight range 38.00-44.00 with good volume. Could that have been people covering their shorts. Is it possible the run up in price was actually just momentum off of the 1/22 trading day jump(which could of been caused by large shorts being covered and HFs booking losses). If you go back to that week and search for news regarding GME by each day. On 1/22 you see a giant spike in GMe articles, media talking about it, Jim Cramer tweeted out 1/22 that GME was a squeeze of a life time etc. this Reddit blew up etc. Will look for a large decrease in shorts to confirm that theory  but..

anyone who shorted the stock from 1/25-1/27 is going to add to the short interest number in the 1/29 report. Any shorts established between 1/25-1/27 made huge profits last week and could of been covered. Meaning the short interest data would show shorts that may actually not exist anymore. 

Because the market is reacting 100x faster to GME moves than it was prior to the 1/15 data is SI data becoming less powerful as a predictor? 

Thoughts?

Title: Why to REALLY buy GME (Solid DD)
LEGITIMATE ARGUMENT TO INVEST IN GME AT THESE PRICES (Short sqeeze and hype aren't reasons). 

Sherman started a turnaround of Gamestop when he first took over April 2019. He cut the dividend, began consolidation (cut some fatty stores), and began debt reduction. COVID threw a wrench in this because he didn't move online nearly fast enough. 

When Burry first invested in GME, there was a reason. What reason? He spoke with Sherman about his plans and thought they wouldn't just survive, but thrive. Cohen also had a similar situation, and later of course he got involved. Sherman listens to both, and in their letters to him they basically tell him where he fucked up and how to move Gamestop forward. 

Fils-Aim the Nintendo guy that likes to turn companies around is added to the board. He turns stuff around as a hobby and is an insanely good marketer. This is shown in particular with his Nintendo of America endeavors. u/kitrosreddit told me not to forget about Reggie so I didn't this time (sorry to the 100ish people that saw this a few days ago) 

Next up we see the Microsoft deal. Although exact numbers aren't available that I can find, Gamestop will be receiving a royalty from gaming equipment sold via Microsoft. Microsoft is also expanding Gamestop's inventory on the inside and employees will use Microsoft software to run the stores. Microsoft doesn't want Gamestop to fail, nor will they let them. With 27% of new games bought at Gamestop and 40% of used games bought there, Microsoft saw an excellent way to try and compete this console cycle. 

We recently saw Gamestop's holiday earnings. With a yearly revenue of roughly $7 bil, they were unprofitable this year. The current P/S ratio makes no sense unless it is expected to go out of business (good luck) or that it will not grow significantly over the coming years (lol). However, this is expected to change with earnings starting in March. They are expected to continue to be profitable moving forward as well. Gamestop still has roughly $500 mil in debt. How are they going to pay this off!!!??? Liquidating stores and consolidation. This was a Cohen continuation idea that Sherman had started, just without the vision to make it succeed. A small stock offering (let's say 2%) would also leave them in an excellent financial situation. Additionally, we have the 300% YOY online sales increase, which accounted for over 30% of total sales. This is only expected to increase moving forward. While overall sales decreased by 3% YOY, inefficient stores were cut out of the picture. Comparative store sales increased by 5% YOY, but this was even stagnated due to state restrictions on 'nonessential' businesses. Places that had significantly fewer COVID numbers had over 30% YOY growth. 

Next, we have the Chewy powerhouses joining the board of directors. Out with the old, in with the new. Even though most directors were acquired in 2020, these new additions add incredible value to the company. Sherman listens to Cohen. Cohen and friends had some focuses at Chewy that led to insane amounts of profit. They focused on cutting costs and maximizing efficiency. Expect the same for Gamestop. This was something that can be effectively implemented with all the new leadership. All ears are on Cohen and his ideas to make Gamestop a 1 stop gaming shop. 

Most recently were the adds on 2/3/21 Francis: That AWS engineering guy that's now heading technology!? Nice. Durkin: Customer service VP from Chewy is now in charge of Gamestop's customer service!? Fuck yes Chewy has insanely good customer service. Krueger: Big filler boi from Amazon et all now running e-commerce fulfillment!? Dope.

Conservative price target: $200 by mid 2021 with little hype and absent a short squeeze

Tldr: Idc about a squeeze or hype but I like the stock. 

But what do I know I'm literally retarded and not a financial advisor... positions 5200 shares GME, 52x covered calls sold exp 2/12, 50x calls bought exp 2/26, a few bucks in cash waiting for a drop if it happens. Tell if I'm wrong somewhere with sources linked please and thank you.

If you haven't listened to Elon Musk's interrogation, i mean interview, of Vlad the RH CEO then you are missing out. Here's the entire interview both audio and text:

[https://www.mrhack.io/blog/elon-musk-vlad-tenev-robinhood-ceo-full-transcript/](https://www.mrhack.io/blog/elon-musk-vlad-tenev-robinhood-ceo-full-transcript/)

Here's some spicy bits about what happened on day Robinhood sold out it's customers- Jan. 28 Thursday :

&gt;**Vlad Tenev:** And so Thursday morning, so Im sleeping. But at three thirty a.m. Pacific, our operations team receives a file from the NSCC, which is the National Securities Clearing Corporation. So basically, as a broker, as a clearing broker, and this is where Robinhood Securities comes in, we have to put up money to the NSCC, based on some factors, including things like the volatility of the trading activity, concentration into certain securities. And this is this is the equities business. So its based on stock trading and not options trading or anything else.  
So they gave us a file with the deposit and the the request was around three billion dollars, which is about an order of magnitude more than what it typically is.  
**Elon Musk:** So why is this kind of like this seems like like it sounds like this is an unprecedented increase in demand for capital. What formula that they use to calculate that?  
**Vlad Tenev:** Well, yeah, and just to give context, Robinhood, up until that point, has raised a little bit around two billion dollars in total venture capital.  
Up until now. So its a big number, like three billion dollars. This is a large number. So basically, the and you know, the details are we dont have the full details. Its a little bit of an opaque formula, but theres a component called the VAR of it, which is value at risk. And thats based on kind of some fairly quantitative things, although its not its not fully transparent. So there are ways to reverse engineer it, but its not kind of publicly shared.  
And then theres a special component, which is discretionary. So thats that kind of acts as a multiplier and basically  
**Elon Musk:** discretionary discretionary meaning, like its just their opinion.  
**Vlad Tenev:** Yeah, its its a little bit I mean, Im sure theres theres definitely more more than just their opinion, but basically  
**Elon Musk:** I mean, I guess what theyve gone through, everyone wants to know whatever it was like, did something maybe shady go down here? Like, it just seems weird that you get a sudden ten billion dollar demand, you know, three billion or even more. Sorry, how much?  
**Vlad Tenev:** Yeah, it was three billion  
**Elon Musk:** up two to three billion around. You know, just suddenly out of nowhere and what does  
**Vlad Tenev:** I wouldnt I wouldnt I wouldnt impute shadiness to it or anything like that. And actually, you know, the NSCC was reasonable subsequent to this. And theyve been theyve been they worked with us to actually lower it. So it was unprecedented activity. You know, we dont I dont have the full context about, you know, what was what was going on in whats going on in the in that is key to make these calculations.  
But, yeah, essentially  
**Elon Musk:** if anyone holding you hostage right now

What Vlad calls "the NSCC was reasonable subsequent to this..." was the $3B deposit was lowered to $700M by the NSCC after RH suspended buy trading on GME.

Among other things that Vlad doesn't say but must know is this-

Title: How 75% of GME Shares Are Still Shorted. S3 is Wrong.
  

\*First off, this is my opinion based on the facts available. This is by no means financial advice. I am not a financial advisor\*

If you are not familiar with EDGAR, it is the SECs database for various types of company filings. One of those filings is called the 13G. 

\*The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Schedule 13G form is an alternative filing for the Schedule 13D form and is used to report a party's ownership of stock which exceeds 5% of a company's total stock issue. Schedule 13G is a shorter version of Schedule 13D with fewer reporting requirements.\*

When a company decides to dispose of beneficial ownership of stock, and holds more then 5% of shares available, they are required to AMEND the filing 13G, making it the 13G/A. When these documents are submitted, they are filed under both the beneficial owner and issuer of stock in EDGAR. 

In the case of GameStops short squeeze, and understanding the exchange of shares during that time period, BlackRock Inc. (BLK) was the only institutional holder, owning over 5% of shares, that liquidated their position SO FAR. BlackRock Inc. liquidated 9,217,335 shares of GameStop on 1/26/2021.

[https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/?r=el#/dateRange=custom&amp;ciks=0001364742&amp;entityName=BlackRock%2520Inc.%2520(BLK)%2520(CIK%25200001364742)&amp;startdt=2016-01-26&amp;enddt=2021-01-27&amp;page=5](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/?r=el#/dateRange=custom&amp;ciks=0001364742&amp;entityName=BlackRock%2520Inc.%2520(BLK)%2520(CIK%25200001364742)&amp;startdt=2016-01-26&amp;enddt=2021-01-27&amp;page=5)

\^control-f: GameStop

BlackRock is the SECOND largest institutional holder of GME, behind FMR LLC with 9,534,090 shares, according to Yahoo Finance. So you are probably wondering, How many shares of GME do The Top 10 Institutions hold combined ?

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders?p=GME)

Lets Count:

\*FMR LLC\*   9,534,090

\*BlackRock Inc\*    - 9,217,335 (According to 13G/A)

\*Vanguard Group Inc.\* 5,288,507

\*Susquehanna International Group LLP\* 4,444,128

\*Dimensional Fund Advisors LP\*  3,948,114

\*Senvest Management LLC\*  3,225,740

\*State Street Corporation\* 2,609,487

\*Morgan Stanley\* 1,995,842

\*Paradice Investment Management LLC\* 1,832,526

\*Norges Bank Investment Management\* 1,811,792

Total: 25,472,891 Shares of GME or 25.473/46.89 = **54% of Float Shares**

&amp;#x200B;

On the same Yahoo Finance page where we found Top Institutional Holder data, if you scroll down, you can see Top Mutual Fund Holders. Combined, these funds hold 18.75/46.89 = **40%** of float shares.

\*Note that two of these mutual funds own over 5% of shares, meaning they would need to file with the SEC if they were to sell. These two mutual funds hold **22%** of float shares. \*

Accounting for BlackRocks liquidation, **54**% of shares are held by the Top 10 Institutional Holders at the moment. Lets say, worst case scenario, only the two biggest mutual funds are left holding shares, making that **22%** of float shares. So far, we have accounted for **76%** of all shares. 

The last data we have on short interest is \~**122%** of float shares. The media has reported numbers as low as **33%** short interest post squeeze**,** according to S3 partners. Mathematically, this is impossible. 

If short interest is truly **33%,** that means these institutional holders would have filed a 13G/A. But they didnt..meaning they did not sell. This means that there is still, **at a minimum, 76% of float shares shorted.**  This is VERY high and could cause another squeeze.

**TL:DR**

As you know, lots of bagholders around the world are not selling. It just so happens that we are not alone. We have some of the BIGGEST institutions bagholding with us; **minimum** **76% of float shares in fact**. If you thought that we were the only greedy and vengeful mfs out there, you are sorrily mistaken. These institutions (i.e. Fidelity, Vanguard, Morgan Stanley) want to see this second squeeze just as much as you. Until then, HOLD THE LINE!!!

Title: GME Positions Cost Distribution--Average price paid is still $122.42
I get this data from Webull (under the analysis section). It seems to be fairly accurate and gives a good idea of what % of investors are holding the stock at what position, and what % of them are 'red' at the end of the day. Currently the stock price is \~52, when in reality most people have paid an average of 122 for it and are still holding onto the stock from yesterday and the day before. This looks bullish to me.

Title: I might get broke, but I will never be a 
TL;DR:
It's been a fun ride. It's not about the money, it's about holding the fucking line. We can make money from now on, it just takes time. Maybe we go down in finance history books, which would be nice.
 Together strong. 



Most people here lost lots of money, some even tons of money (literally).

Maybe the stock will plummet, idc. I'm staying for the whole ride and will never sell untill $1000 (even if it takes decades and you won't buy but a bread with $1000 due to inflation). 

Fuck money. Money can be made. Trading or otherwise. 

I'm sure if people made so far a thousand or a million, can make at least twice just by taking what they have learned here. 

It will just take some time.

Even with GME. Instead of just pumping, I could just hold and all try help the company itself (more investing over long periods of time, engaging with it more, buy more of its product, help promoting it) so its stock price will go back up (stonks).

It just takes, relatively, forever.

It surely sounds absurd, foolish, and retarded, but at this point I will hold the line. I like the stock.

Ar least I'm not a . Maybe we're not  yet, but our time will come.

I'm still  and I stand by it. I believe in apes together strong slogan.  


Some people exited the game (maybe join in later). And that's okay. We should have expected it. It's just human dynamics. Humans get bored and scared and just exit. 

So far it was a fun ride. Maybe it will get crazier or just crash, but it will be interesting anyways.

Some guy said that this moment will go down in finance history; maybe he's right. At least I was a part of it.

Hold on to the moon.

Title: Why I liquidated all my GME holdings at an 80% loss to go all in on AMC?
I will start this DD by saying to those still holding GME, your awesome and I cheer your successes with it and support you in your losses. I know that many of you bought the stock b/c you truly like the company and I honestly believe Ryan Cohen and his new pals will turn the ship around for GameStop, although believe that will take some time.

I will try to keep this brief for all the apes / autists here but even YOLO plays should have some level of reason to them (maybe?).

TLDR version -

1. GME is better positioned for a SS 2.0 but AMC will likely benefit
2. AMC is better fundamentally positioned as the economy re-opens and consumers migrate from video games to getting out and socializing at the movies
3. AMC pre-pandemic was around $6 - $7 supporting the current buy point (although it may go lower as GME drags lower)
4. AMC took advantage of it's rising stock price to eliminate some of its debt
5. Whales believe in it's potential too - Dave Portney bought $700k worth of AMC yesterday

As of 2/4, S3 shows 15.71% shares float short interest against AMC (44.68M out of 284.47M) vs 50.68% of GME (25.86M out of 51.03M float). This isn't public, I had to pay for this.

Short interest is one thing, but lets compare that to daily volume.

The 20 Average Volume is 72.7 M for GME and 289M for AMC. AMC goes through 101.6% of it's float shares a day and GME goes through 142% of it's float across the 20 day average. This makes the short ratio (or days to cover) at 0.356 for GME and 0.155 for AMC which means that if a SS 2.0 were to happen it will more than likely happen for GME as the short positions on AMC could quickly be covered without causing much craziness. However, AMC's swings is heavily correlated to GME - see below.

&amp;#x200B;

[Price Swing Between AMC vs GME across Short Squeeze](https://preview.redd.it/7gdp49o8djf61.png?width=2310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=339dab698f0722a62b99e00b334cdd1e3dad88fd)

&amp;#x200B;

While correlation is not causation, it's likely that during a GME SS 2.0, this will greatly impact AMC. Furthermore, the AMC has not crashed as much as GME either having now overtaken it today in the upward direction. As GME continues to slide down amidst restrictions and scrutiny, all of the people that had 10x profit of their investment will began to recognize more and more how heavy  can be causing more sell-off reducing the impact of a SS 2.0 (e.g. if it falls to $30, I don't think SS 2.0 could take it above $90).

I previously wrote a DD about how GME could be fundamentally worth $300, I think that will take quite a bit of time in re-inventing the company whereas AMC will benefit much more quickly than GameStop in the short-term. As the economy re-opens, people will be running away from video games to getting out and going to watch movies. The pre-pandemic price of AMC 2/14/20 was $7.10 which means that at the very least if it goes down by a lot more, it is likely to return to this level as the economy re-opens. In other words, AMC is on discount right now while GME will continue to be on discount for a while and continually increasing it's discount percentage (so you could make profits on AMC and then get GME for an even greater discount than currently).

Long-term, I think AMC will continue to struggle as distribution companies look to release films through streaming platforms but for now as economic restrictions continue to lift and more people feel safer about getting out and about, AMC is primed for vast short-term success. 

Fundamentally, this is safer than holding out for a GME SS 2.0 and still benefits from a GME SS 2.0 as well.

As of Q3 2020, AMC has a debt-to-asset ratio of 121.47% vs GME debt-to-asset ratio of 87.3%. However, AMC didn't start opening up theaters until Aug 20, 2021 which is 50 days closed out of 91 days of the quarter (e.g. they were open for less than half of the quarter) while continuing to pay for benefits to all of its employees. This bleeds through cash like a bullet wound to the aorta. As opposed to GameStop, they were able to open many of it's stores earlier in Q2 with eCommerce growth and continued Q3 debt-to-asset increase. That said, for Q4, many of AMC's theaters were open being able to start earning revenue and not just bleeding money.

Q4's EPS estimate for AMC is -$3.68 EPS vs Q3 -$5.70. I actually believe it won't be as low and could be as high as -$3 EPS. The last year AMC was profitable was 2017 as people spend more time streaming movies than going to the movies, but the forecasted trend is still positive for AMC.

The major weight on a company's ability to overcome obstacles, such as a global pandemic, is having to take on debt. Debt can open lots of opportunities, but if it's a means to survive rather than grow, it really creates a burden. This is where AMC made a great move in my opinion over GME with converting it's debt to shares eliminating $600M worth of debt. While it has diluted the shares (and would have diluted GME shares too) reducing SS potential, it enhances the ability of the company to grow reducing that burden of debt.

Finally, Dave Portney who said he was exiting all the meme stocks has went back into AMC by $700k - [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dave-portnoy-stakes-700k-amc-061244626.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dave-portnoy-stakes-700k-amc-061244626.html).

My price target for AMC is $30 within the year . It's been there before and with bent-up demand, it has a lot more to gain than hoping for a GME SS 2.0.

AMC is expected to report earnings on 2/25/21.

Title: $T 2021
$T 2021-2022 Play, Check 2/19 Options at 30C

Hey you guys, making this short, don't have time for you "insert derogatory term here."
Came here to update you with 3 important things you should know about ATT.  

&amp;#x200B;

1.  this week guys been loading up T 2/19 30C.  At first it was a few thousand contracts, then 10K yesterday, and then today about 53K, Check the books tomorrow, but looks like those were all added to the 30c existing OI at 40K, tomorrow opening 80K+ OI.   Find the other legs if you think I'm wrong.  50K at closing bid .12 = 500K +
2. T is a solid company, they showed in ER, they are not a decliner no matter how Buffett pumps TMUS. HBO Max &amp; Time warner are going to be huge performers for them.  More importantly is that T is consolidating great entertainment IP in all genres and they have the best library of old content to exploit in the future.  HBO Max has some kinks, and they aren't selling it hard to investors, this is sleeper value, which might be a thing sometime.
3. My reason to buy $T for 2021 is unrelated to options activity.  Biden and Dems will payback ATT for all the help CNN provided in winning the election.  I don't know how this will all work, but my best guess is government contracts having to do with fiberoptic internet or 5g, maybe a little backdoor pork with internet in schools.

little words area:

short term high risk

$T 2/19 30C @ .13

short term high risk

$T 2/19 28C @ .86   (.35 premium)

long term pork play medium risk:

$T 1/20/23 20C @ 8.8, you get 3x leverage with same .35 premium, but no dividends, don't buy this unless you like #3 and want to wait out for developing corruption which will take a while to flesh out.

OK  lazy and just C&amp;P from faking alpha:

* Lupkynis is the first FDA-approved oral therapy for lupus nephritis.
* Approved label supports patented dosing protocol, which will last until 2037.
* 65k annual revenue is expected per lupus nephritis patient.
* *\~10% lupus nephritis market penetration in five years will give Aurinia stock 120%+ upside. \[This is shit as we only look for stocks +500% in a week\]*
* A potential buyout for Aurinia is possible but will likely take some time.

CO has $300M cash virtually no debt, so they can survive long enough till some BIg Pharma with a Big head offers a buyout. 

Sell on news is strong on this one. 

Bottom line: **Own share with FDA approval at pre-approval price**.

Position: 1000 at $15.5,  maybe more.

Title: AMC PLAN UPDATE
# AMC UPDATE

# I just want to preface by providing the source of my data. They will be sourced after each statistic I state.

Alright everyone is freaking out at close today and it must be a scary thing seeing your money drop like that. I want update people on the current facts and clear up some misunderstandings. First of all, short interest rate is key here. The last updated short interest was 44.67M shares as of January 27, 2021 from [shortsqueeze.com](https://shortsqueeze.com).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xpnkiwr57jf61.png?width=410&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b731069f9917af34e908cabfba1718c461ac2ec7

From that and the total float is 56.57M shares from [marketwatch.com](https://marketwatch.com). This is gives us a value of 78.96% of total float shorted. Now I feel like a lot of people have been selling because they think that the short interest ratio represents the amount of time that it takes for institutions to cover their short positions. THIS IS FALSE. You can hold a short position forever if you wanted, you just need to pay interest on your principal. So for example if an institution were to short AMC when it was $15, they would be able to keep that position as long as they paid interest on $15 \* # of shares shorted. What we really need to do is have a high price with a HIGH SHORT INTEREST RATIO. Having a high short interest ratio means that institutions have MORE pressure to cover their positions because they will have to pay interest on that amount of time. Keep in mind that short interest is not reported regularly and the next time it is reported will be on market close February 9, 2021 as per [shortsqueeze.com](https://shortsqueeze.com).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lr1nckf67jf61.png?width=408&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37e418f0d5f8fe25ed258ebc5482a3dff55cb752

If short interest increases, this means that there is still potential to short squeeze and adds pressure for the institutions to cover (days to cover increases as the numerator of the ratio increases).

Title: [Fundamental Analysis] The Bullish Case on GME using Traditional Analysis [2200% Upside]
Many of us are worried about GME's price currently, but **PLEASE READ THIS.**

I am going to use **traditional investing fundamentals and ratios, but more specifically,** 

**the ICONIC price to sales ratio.** 

# Calculations

The price to sales is calculated by dividing the share price of a stock by it's sales per year.

A healthy price to sales in this era is around 30.

This can be derived by looking at other technological innovators in the field including TSLA CHWY NKLA PENN and various other companies.

# GME's Price to Sales is emphasizes it as a "value play"

GME's price to sales it a mere 1.31. That means for every 1.31 dollars in share price, their company has 1 dollar in revenue **an absolute steal.**

I have never seen anything like it. 

# Conclusion

At a generous price to sales ratio (\~30), **GME's valuation is strongly undervalued and the stock represents 2200% upside ($1100 per share)**

&amp;#x200B;

# TLDR:

**GME is fundamentally undervalued and could easily be $1000 per share at traditional valuations.**

**DONT LET HEDGE FUNDS DECEIVE YOU**

Title: $SDC: Growth Opportunity
Smile Direct Club ($SDC) is a quickly growing tele-dentistry company that has existing partnerships with CVS and HP. The company had an IPO in 2019 at 20.55, but currently trades around $13. The chart over the last year or so has been climbing dutifully, as the company beat it's last ER estimate by 26% and recently announced some new technology called Comfort Sense that will make it's aligners better and more comfortable. 

On the downside, the company just today released a new convertible offering that will dilute existing shareholders. Given the trajectory of growth of this company, however, I believe this may present a buying opportunity. 

The trajectory of the company's earnings combined with the growth of telehealth and new technology that the company is investing in make this stock a great growth opportunity in my book.

If you are looking for a YOLO, they are projected to announce earnings at the end of the month. Otherwise, this is a more reliable stock to build back one's portfolio...

Title: My Math on the GME Short Squeeze
**Disclaimer:** I am not a financial advisor. I am just a guy who spent 3 hours researching shorts and doing the math on the GME short. If I am being a full blown retard, tell me how and I will adjust my math accordingly.

**TL:DR, Shorts are probably paying about $1 million dollars per day to hold our shares.**

Shorties will have to buy back the stock....but as long as they meet the daily interest payments, they will not be pressured to do so. They pay interest everyday on the stocks that they've borrowed. To calculate how much they have to pay each day, I used the following formula: (Share Price x # of Stocks shorted x Interest)/365. Source for the formula: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-loan-fee.asp#:\~:text=A%20stock%20loan%20fee%2C%20or,hedge%20fund%20or%20retail%20investor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-loan-fee.asp#:~:text=A%20stock%20loan%20fee%2C%20or,hedge%20fund%20or%20retail%20investor)

On Jan 27th the stock was $347. I don't know what the interest rate at the time was, but I will assume 9%. I also assume the shares were shorted 120%.

($347 X 61,236,000 shares short X 9% )/365 = $5,239,452.82.

I apply this formula for the last week and push it out to Feb 27th:

* 120% of the float is still shorted.

Positions: 3 GME stock @ $276 and 2 deep OTM weekly calls. Holding because I like this stock. GME has a great potential in the future e-sports and gaming market. And I don't like shorties. Those cheaters can't have my stock. They got fleeced. I hope all of their clients stop doing business with those fools. Calling my congressman about the shit we saw here the past week (I know, not expecting much).

Title: Our Portfolios are Red Physically, but Green MORALLY 
Today was a rough day for many of us, but don't forget:

**By losing our money in a pump and dump, we are protesting financial injustice.**

**Melvin is in tears right now looking at our devotion to the cause.** 

**Reddit, ASSEMBLE!**

Title: $ASSF out the ass
Real cheap.  Like a dollar a stock.  What else can you buy for a dollar.  Think they sell asses.  They cornered the ass market.

Title: okay listen to me we need to rally together in during the after market and search for hidden messages in the GME stock graph to find clues to stop the ladder attacks at open tomorrow
im afraid this is our last hope. the ladder attacks are demonic in nature and must be stopped if we are going to get to the real stock price again. i have been searching for hidden messages but we need more ape power 

Title: How do I tell my Mom about GME?
My mom let me install robinhood on my iphone 5 for my birthday and I spent my $40 on .1 share of GME.   
How do I tell her I lost $30?  
Feeling lost rn 

Title: Listen up Reatards
The volume for AMC and NOK is low.  I have no idea what that means.  The way I see it, its like lowering the volume on my television and not listening to any noise.  Ill hold because I have no idea what Im doing and unlike some dumbasses here, I only used disposable income.  I can always sell my wife and make everything I lost back



Title: I don't understand, how was Reddit EVER wrong?????
I can not fathom how GME is going down. I read the posts on short laddering, short bussing, and the **Short Escalator Omega Overflow attack, but NOTHING CAME TO FRUITION.**

Surely Reddit can't be wrong.

I think it's the hedge funds using a secret ninja technique, what are your thoughts?

Title: Short Interest in $CLOV (in light of Hindenburg Research)
Just a heads up for those interested:

Although short interest as a % of float is and always has been low for CLOV, I think its important to note with today's short report that although shares shorted outstanding were largely flat 6/30-11/15, there's been some big whales recently shorting $CLOV:

Shares outstanding at each point of time (courtesy of S3):

11/15/2020: 0.629 Million Shares Short

11/30/2020: 0.730 Million Shares Short

12/15/2020: 1.650 Million Shares Short

12/31/2020: 4.321 Million Shares Short

01/15/2021: 9.110 Million Shares Short

It would be interesting to hear from Hindenburg Research when they started offering $CLOV short reports to their clients since they mentioned that they started this research 4 months ago...

#Not an advisor, blabla - bought 2 call options today for may at $2.5 strike.

Title: Inverse WSB strategy- time to buy Gamestonk??
Ill keep this simple. If youre new to this sub, you probably dont know that some people here trade against the WSB hype consensus. They sell when WSB says it cant go tits up. And they buy when WSB says theres no money to be made. 

As the red dildos keep growing, WSB is turning their back against GME. Haters are climbing out of their caves left and right. People are saying the run is over. And maybe theyre right? But maybe somewhere in the sweet serenity of -40% red dildos phase 2 is starting to brew. Maybe...

TL;DR 
Im neutral on GME, but I love to inverse WSB and the cave dwellers have me feeling pretty bullish. I have my eye on shares &amp; late Feb calls. Do your own research and play with what you can afford to lose- this isnt investment advice.

Edit:


Title: adding $BBBY under $30 per share to your Short Squeeze Arsenal is a crazy smart play right now (re-done and updated)
#BTW: I don't care if you guys call me a Jim Cramer

&amp;nbsp;

I bought in to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond $BBBY during last weeks _Mania_ @$38 for 34 shares, plus a $45 $BBBY Call Option @$380 (not very bright), and 1.45 shares of $GME @$324. 
-[My current $BBBY shares](https://imgur.com/U2OcW7B)
-[My current $BBBY Call Option](https://imgur.com/a94pyQP)
-[My current $GME share](https://imgur.com/iKhWuqP)

#At its current price Bed Bath &amp; Beyond $BBBY has a long trend value of $33 in 6 months.  The stock is shorted at 65% and the company has already started a stock buy back program. At a price below $30, $BBBY is a good bet - [List of most shorted stock on the market right now]( https://imgur.com/Nm4hsxQ). 

During this Cycle (which Im starting after the Covid correction in March) $BBBY has had a fairly constant Uptrend that, even after the first January correction, has a trend that still lines up with the troughs on the higher-low line:  [Trend Line for $BBBY since March 2020](https://imgur.com/dhbfPzw)

Bed Bath &amp; Beyond sells home goods and so called smart money thinks there is going to be a downturn in home goods when the Covid stuff ends. Buying home goods during the Stay-at-Home orders is what they call *Nesting.* which is why so many of them shorted the stock, but $BBBY will be fine for at least the next 6 months, or even 9 months. Were not going to be leaving our houses for the next few months anyways, which will continue the *Nesting* trend for another good quarter or two, and it will take investors a few down quarters to start frowning on $BBBY.  So that means current investors are HOLDING. That brings the trend price based on the higher-low line to about $33 in July, 10%+ where the current stock price is at:  [Continued trend line for $BBBY into July 2021](https://imgur.com/ml6swYO)

Plus, Bed Bath and Beyond begas a stock buy back program back in October. The plan has been halted, for obvious reasons, but theyve [announced to restart buying shares again in March]( https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bed-bath-beyond-bbby-concludes-162704294.html)

If the company is shorted at 64%, but has long growth of 10%, buying $BBBY at under $30 is the best way to take advantage of a potential **Rocketing** short-squeeze that, even if a short-squeeze doesnt pan out, you probably wont lose money.

#You might be saying: *Hey retard, you cant just put a green line on a chart and say it going to work that way.*

True! But, if we look at the things coming in 2021 on why people would need convenient Home Goods, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond $BBBY is going to have healthy sales figures for the foreseeable future. Im calling **The Doubles**

##1. DOUBLE THE AMOUNT GATHERINGS AT OTHER PEOPLES HOMES IN 2021!
Hedge Fund belief is that when the pandemic is over there is going to be a mad desire for larger than life gatherings like Concerts and such. That is true, but theres going to be long ramp up period for that. However, a year full of missed birthday parties, anniversary parties, retirement parties, youth sport team parties, divorce parties, dessert and campaign parties (these are actually pretty fun. I dont drink btw, I go for the deserts), cookout for the hell of it parties, etc  are going to happen at an accelerated Rate in 2021. Did you know Bed Bath &amp; Beyond sells party supplies? Im not talking about just paper plates and napkins; Im talking about serving platters, serving utensils, electric food warming trays, beverage tubs, margarita machines, kegerators, bathroom towels, random stuff to make your house look nicer when guests come over all the stuff someone would want for a party. 

People dont have time to wait for an online order to show up when theyre preparing for a party, especially if they need those items the day of. So they go to the store to get it when they think about it.


##2. DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF EXTENDED STAYS AT FAMILY AND FRIENDS HOMES! 
Long distance family and friends havent seen each other IN PERSON for a long time and reunions are going to be #1 on peoples travel list. Couch surfing and guest rooms are going to be the top destination for most people in 2021. Smart Money thinks there are a ton people out there with the money spend on Cruises and trips to Disneyland? Hogwash! People are going to be visiting their family Back Home or traveling to Boston so their 4-year-old daughter can meet her cousins in person. And the hosts for these guest roomers and couch surfers are going to update their hospitality amenities (such as clean sheets, towels, toothbrush holders). Many of them wont have time to wait for an online delivery; theyre going to need those items NOW. And where will they update guest hospitality items right now? BED BATH AND BEYOND!  

##3. DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF WEDDING REGISTRYS!
All the weddings that got canceled last year are going to happen this year. Plus all the weddings that are supposed to happen this year are also going to happen this year. And do you know what is attached to all those damn Wedding Invitations? A Wedding Registry! And where are all of them registered at? BED BATH &amp; BEYOND! May-August going to be Diamond Hands for them. 

Heres a great vomit-inducing article about the increase in weddings in 2021 &amp; 2022 because people like links in these DDs: https://www.insider.com/weddings-will-be-more-expensive-after-pandemic-2022-2021-1

##4. DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF STUFF FOR COLLEGE DORM ROOMS!
A ton of new college kids didnt move into their dorms last year which means double the tonnage of new college kid will be moving in this year. And those college kids are going to need sheets, blankets, pillows, towels, shower caddys, lamps, etc  And Mom is going to want to shop with their kid to buy that stuff together. Andy where are they going to shop for that? BED BATH &amp; BEYOND

##5. WORK FROM HOME IS HERE TO STAY! 
Sure, you might say people already stocked up home stuff during the lockdown and that buying binge is over. ITS NOT OVER ITS NOW HERE TO STAY!  And when you get squirrely stuck at home with nothing to do, sometime you go out and buy stuff for your home. Its like: You know what I need? A new coffeemaker. Lets go get one right now. Or, Remember how so and sos dishes all matched each other, lets go get some matching dishes right now.  When squirrely hits, you arent going to wait around for an online delivery, youre going to go get it NOW.

##6. IF A SHORT SQUEEZE IS GOING TO HAPPEN ON A STOCK, ITS REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN TO THIS ONE, AND IF IT DOESNT, YOURE STILL IN GOOD SHAPE!
$BBBY is a good stock. The company is liquid, there is a need for their goods, and they offer convenience for immediate purchases. Plus, lots of people and companies already own the stock with no intention of selling.  Its financial stability, firm upward trend, and staying power already have it as a HOLD or LONG by 4 out of 5 reporting agencies, which is what conservative money looks at. 

Oh yea, some Key company factors: 
1)	As per their last report they got $2.2 billion in the bank. Theyre Liquid
2)	15 million have downloaded their store app
3)	2.2 million new online customers last year
4)	Other important financials that IDK what theyre about
5)	They dumped all their subsidiaries and now just focus on one thing, Convenient Home Goods!

Title: Understand the wash-sale rule
Many new investors here may not have heard of the "wash-sale rule." It is important.

When you sell a security (such as GME) at a loss, you can claim that loss on your tax return (it will be subtracted from your capital gains/reduce your taxable income). HOWEVER, if you then buy that security back (or a "substantially identical" security) within 30 days before or after, you void any capital losses you had in terms of tax loss harvesting. In other words, you can not use those capital losses to reduce your taxable income and you will just eat the losses.

Thank you for listening and continue retarding. Merry tendies.

Edit: You CAN actually purchase/sell two different S&amp;P500 ETFs without violating the wash-sale rule.

Title: A new stock i really like $GAYMF
Okay guys i've been lurking this subreddit for some years, The $GME squeeze was legendary and should still be squozing, but we know how suits operate.  however, i found a new stock i really like.  Galway Metals, or $GAYMF for short.  Let me tell you more about it:

\-I can't find any information on their financials because its an OTC market

\-I can't find any information on their press releases

\-I can't find any information on who are the largest shareholders

\-I can't find any relevant or new information on the company.

What does this mean?

It means the only reason anyone would buy this company, is for their name. $GAYMF.  Why would this stock ever go down, when there is only 1 reason to buy?  I can rest assured knowing I have taken a large position in the only stock corporations can't fuck with, because they're homophobic if they stop my new stock from going up.  I like $GAYMF

Title: I have received word from a classified and well grounded source that the impending short squeeze will occur on 2/8/2021 at precisely 11:38 Eastern Standard Time, you will regret your cardboard hands.
A classified individual has informed me that the long awaited impending short squeeze will occur on Monday 2/8/2021 between the hours of 11:30-11:45 am EST. The Hedge funds intend to cover their short positions after a supposed sell off before Market Closing on Friday 2/5/2021. Dont let the Hedge Funds be right. Hold the line and on Monday you will be greatly rewarded. The individual who provided me this tip told me that after the squeeze a ball park estimate of $700-$3000 will be expected. Hold the line boys

Title: To AMC
AMC reps, if you see this: that pump to $19 was for you. Use that gift well to turn around what was once a great company. I will continue to hold and believe AMC will get out alive and become a profitable company again within 1-2 years. I have 473 shares of AMC.

Title: Vuzix - jumping on the augmented reality train before it takes off
Tldr; augmented reality/smart glasses will be one of the big new trends over the next few years. Buying Vuzix will give you the chance to be a part of it before it really takes off 

But smart glasses look bad - who would wear them? Maybe theyre not being used in everyday leisure use just yet, but they have several existing usages in industry 

Other reasons:
- Theyre turning a profit now (as of the last quarter)

- Their results are due in March, so good to jump in now before they get pumped in the lead up to/after results 

- They already have several industry contacts
Stay at home is only further reinforcing the use of smart glasses

Title: Feeling FUD? Come rest and warm your diamond hands by the fire my fellow apes.
First of all, I'm not a financial expert and you should do your own research and such. In this post, I'm going to discuss how volume has behaved in relation to price and why the behavior we've seen in GME the past few days is ***incredibly unusual***.

We all suspect that there's heavy market manipulation going on, so I'm just 

It all started when I decided to take a peek at this graph  on the 1-hour timeframe of price with On Balance Volume plotted below it.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yk768la97if61.png?width=1258&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39df33410c2a9d7540f2f6e8ce2de0dcc5c8eb80

**What is On Balance Volume?**

On Balance Volume (OBV) is a way of cumulatively measuring volume. It adds all volume from periods where the price rose and subtracts all volume from periods where price dropped. 

**What does this mean graph mean, then?**

Remember, OBV shows *cumulative* volume pressure. It doesn't measure the amount of volume that happens over a period of time. Typically, OBV should mirror price pretty closely, but here we see the price plummeting and OBV holding steady near its high moving sideways.

When I saw this, I immediately thought something was off. In market equilibrium roughly 50% of periods the price will rise and 50% of periods the price will fall (Remember whether price increased or decreased is critical to the calculation of OBV) which would make OBV behave as it currently is. In a trending asset, this ratio of green candles to red candles should become skewed, or we could see a higher average volume in green or red candles specifically, and as either of these changes, OBV will increase or decrease.

So since GME is trending down the past few days, we should expect to see a skewed distribution of red to green candles (Which would cause OBV to crash), and I wrote a quick script to measure and confirm this hypothesis:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dfdrl8erfif61.png?width=2607&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aae35a0accb33f7152fa9c71f98ab3ebc4a23ba6

This histogram is simple and calculated by: *number of green candles - number of red candles* and it uses data from the past 30 periods (In this case, 30 hours).  The histogram currently shows -8, a ratio of 11:19 or about 63% negative 37% positive, which is what we hypothesized. 

*Phew*, that was a lot. But now that we have everything out on the table we should be able to see where things don't line up...

**There's nearly twice as many red periods as green periods, but OBV hasn't changed.**

So, 19 of the last 30 one-hour periods were subtracted from OBV, and 11 were added, meaning *there must be a huge skew of the amount of volume traded on hours the price is green vs the hours that price is red.* 

Essentially, THE HEDGIES HAVEN'T CLOSED, THEY'RE DOUBLING DOWN.

TL;DR the price is crashing down, and every time buyers flock in to buy at the new low, crazy amounts of shares are sold halting any momentum and causing the price to continue to fall. THE HEDGIES HAVEN'T CLOSED, THEY'RE DOUBLING DOWN.

This is not financial investment advice, i am not a financial services professional, this is just my opinion.


Disclaimer: I had 1 (one) share that i bought for $360 as a joke. I sold yesterday at a 280 loss.


Anyone on this sub who had any idea what they were doing are long gone, because they were in it for the money and they got it. There is no movement, you are not hurting hedgefunds. They are making money off you. 
Over the past two weeks, anyone who was critical of what was going on were downvoted into oblivion because it didnt fit with the narrative that was being pushed by the influx of naive and greedy non-investors. You are taking advice from people who are desperate to make you buy and hold so the price can pump enough for them to exit at a smaller loss. 


There is no squeeze coming. There is no exit, GME is never going to 100 again. Please step away and look at what has happened, reflect on your situation and draw your own conclusion.

Title: Best trading app for Americans in Europe?

Is eToro good?  They keep spamming me on YouTube...

Title: What we know
Because there is a lot of shit going around here is what we know.
Gme did NOT get to its peak at 486 via a short squeeze. We know this because the S3 data that was going around all last week still had the SI at 121% AFTER the price started coming back down from that peak. 

We know that synthetic longs are a thing and don't change the SI but DO change what they get to report as SI. This means next Tuesdays short report might not matter, don't hang your hat on it.

We know deep dips happen before a squeeze in previous short squeezes. I looked at not on vw but also tesla and a bunch of no name penny stocks that have charts in articles about short squeezes and they all repeat this pattern of going up a lot then all the way back down to original prices, then a massive run up with the squeeze about previous peaks.

What we don't know...
We don't know if they actually covered or just did synthetic longs.

We don't know if it is all over.

We don't know, if a squeeze is going to happen later, when that will be. So STOP giving artificial expiration dates and shit like some evangelist trying to predict the end times. You sound like an asshole and you will be wrong every time.

We don't know if we can hold longer than they can stay solvent. But I know I don't have any money i care about in gme so Idgaf.



Edit: obligatory position 48 gme across two different accounts. I can't do math.

Not Financial advice. Fuck you, I do what I want.

Title: F is extremely undervalued, great long term buy and hold.
Tired of gme and amc volatility? Want something that is undervalued and somewhat stable? Check out trusty old F(ord).  They trade at a low p/e, are starting to get into EVs while other American automakers fall behind. They have a strong business in trucks and financing, and their outlook will only improve as the pandemic subsided.

Title: Why BLIAQ is the next big thing
I just really like BLIAQ, does anyone else like BLIAQ?

This stock is so undervalued right now we could totally squeeze the dumb hedgies by all buying BLIAQ and pushing the price up, they won't see it coming if we all just buy BLIAQ!

Title: Fake Holds 
Im seeing way to many posts about people who are holding, or betting the house on GME or AMC. 

Way too many trolls in this thread, trying to push people to buy a sinking ship. 

Unless you post a photo of your current position in the stock then you shouldnt be able to say shit about it.

Title: Buy CLOV, the Hindenburg report was ignorant garbage
The new $CLOV research released by Hindenburg Research is severely flawed. I honestly do not think they understand how the healthcare payment system works. This seems like an obvious attack on Chamath for his criticism of short sellers recently and support of us retards

1. The DOJ investigation is doomed from the start. Kickbacks are hard to prove and can be structured in many legal forms

2. Operating at a loss is the norm for disruptive companies and the fact they plan to be profitable by 2023 is impressive.

3. Criticizing Clover for sales tactics that mislead the elderly is just laughable. Having a company you own help patients with insurance choices is the least deceptive thing insurance companies do. You may as well dissolve the AARP (please do) for screwing seniors for decades

4. Clover was fined by CMS for misleading tactics, but CMS fines companies CONSTANTLY. CVS/Caremark/Aetna is caught defrauding the government every year but they just get a slap on the wrist.

5. The assertion that Clover mislead patients about services shows just how little Hindenburg understands our healthcare payment system. Insurance companies promise coverage to patients in regards to tier based copays and networks that they CONSTANTLY change

6. Seek Medicare, as I mentioned before, is no different than Geico giving you quotes from multiple insurance companies. This is nothing compared to CVS/Caremark/Aetna sharing patient data to steer them toward conglomerate owned services.

7. Going after Clover for marketing their software as a driver of sales because they use a marketing and sales team is just lazy.

8. Removing your name and ownership of companies for compliance reasons is incredibly common. So your company uses a company you know and trust? Big deal. No one will care about this when they let conglomerates go with a pinky promise that they won't share data

9. You are allowed to give out gifts to offices. A certain amount is allowed per year.

10. They are seriously attacking insurance for upcoding like it is something new. They all do it, intentionally or unintentionally. It is easily passed off on a mistake when they are audited. This is not groundbreaking information

11. If the software is easy for people to use, it is improving patient care. And guess what, ALL HEALTHCARE SOFTWARE IS DESIGNED FOR CODING PURPOSES

12. You want it to be difficult to do things like remove diagnoses in your software. It is intentional to prevent you from making a mistake. All software has tedious crap to make sure we don't unintentionally delete something important

13. Paying physicians more is always going to delight them. Using a criminally underpaying system like medicare as a baseline just shows how little Hindenburg understands

14. Getting physicians to adopt new software is HARD. They seriously retire or quit over stuff like that. Adoption rate will be slow, so the fact that those who have adopted are using the software 98% of the time is a big deal

15. If you were to call 100 doctors offices, 99 would complain about the software. Providers HATE software. Insurance companies require more and more paperwork every year and the software that helps with that is always criticized.

16. Hindenburg is calling member growth lump and sporadic while failing to understand that signing up for Medicare only happens at certain times in the year. There is a reason there is a spike every year and slow down.

17. The rest is just a personal attack on Garipalli

This was by far the laziest and ignorant short report I have ever read. Hindenburg research needs to understand the industry it is talking about before publishing this kind of crap. This was so bad, it encouraged me to grab $CLOV calls for the obvious rebound

I'm not a financial advisor, I'm a pharmacist who deals with this crap all day

Title: GME borrow interest is only 8.9% atm
[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) it's 8.9 now, it's basically to pre $20 levels. If you think its still over 100 you are thick as shit. If you think short int is a better indicator than borrow rates you are thick as shit.

Title: My Bull Thesis on Nokia ($NOK)
TLDR: I like the stock, little risk high reward at it's current price.

What a ride this has been man. Crazy to see how much this sub has grown in popularity and all the attention it's gotten. I myself was interviewed by the Wall Street Journal. Keep fighting the good fight everyone.

NOK has been on my radar and a lot of other people's radars for many reasons. The biggest one being their transition from a cellphone manufacturer to a cell service provider, trying to get into the 5G space. That's the main reason they had a little bit of a pop in recent days, I myself had $7 calls that went up 300%

This bull run was fueled by investor excitement over their transition into 5G. They still have a ways to go to really get their footing into the market as the 5G space is super competitive right now but if they play their cards right they could easily back into the mainstream and have a bright future ahead of them. They recently beat their earnings expectation and have had a strong 2020. 

Challenges do remain. Like I said before, they're going up against some huge competition in the 5G space with the likes of Samsung, Huawei, ZTE, etc. They're also handcuffed to CSPs who posses significant pricing power (According to Morningstar)

Despite these challenges,  I think of Nokia as a good buy at it's current price ($4.36 per share at the time I'm writing.) I don't believe their 5G abilities have been priced into the stock, simply because there is a long road ahead for them. 2021 will be a challenging year as Nokia tries to get their foot into the door but if they can weather the storm it can be a good payday for those who bought into their vision early on. Investor sentiment suggests investors are confident that they will pull this out. Today's put/call ratio stands at .14 which is extremely bullish. At a current price of $4.36 per share, there isn't too much to lose here if the worst case scenario plays out.

Positions: None, I'm taking a little bit of time to just enjoy life and not have to worry about the markets. I'm enjoying life and on the side I'll be posting some research on WSB here and now since finance is my passion.

Title: Amplia Therapeutics (INNMF)
Amplia Therapeutics is currently in Phase 1 FDA trials of AMP945 and is expecting to conclude Phase 1 trials in March 2021.  AMP945 is a Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) inhibitor.  From my understanding, the FAK will be used to break the barrier of fibrotic tumors in cancers (pancreatic and ovarian) which currently are difficult to treat resulting in a high mortality rate. The result they are expecting is to break down the fibrotic tissue surrounding these types of tumors resulting in more successful treatments.  In Phase 2 trials, Amplia intends to trial their FAK on ovarian and pancreatic tumors as well as other fibrotic diseases.  

You can read their latest quarterly report here (includes info about AMP945):
[Quarterly Reprt](https://www.ampliatx.com/site/PDF/949adec6-bade-49b0-891c-78ff7828dce5/QuarterlyActivitiesandCashflowReportsDec2020Qtr)

If phase 1 trials prove to be effective, we could see partnerships and a higher upside potential given the market cap is only $20M.  I plan on holding for the long term though I only have 6,000 shares which I purchased at .16/share.

Back in July of 2020 there were also Australian companies increasing their stake in the company - Motley Fool even put up an article on it.

Title: AMC shares outstanding
https://ycharts.com/companies/AMC/shares_outstanding

I see a lot of people looking at the AMC chart and thinking they are limited on their downside because it was worth about the same before the pandemic happened. One factor nobody is really talking about is the fact that the number of shares outstanding has quadrupled since then to keep them out of bankruptcy.

So even with lower interest rates and the pandemic clearing up, the stock would have to be valued at 4x the amount to have the current stock price. I know the squeeze is what is keeping the price where it is, but just making sure everybody knows their is more downside that could become realized.

I am also aware that they just paid 600 million dollars in debt but they are still in ~$5 bln in debt so no better than pre-pandemic.

Title: GME and AMC Short Volume
Hey guys take a look at this website

[https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)

Short Volume: 9,638,240 

It seems like most of the short positions are gone for GME. I don't know if I'm interpreting this incorrectly. The public float is 51.03M so the percentage of shares that are shorted is pretty low.

&amp;#x200B;

AMC on the other hand

[https://fintel.io/ss/us/amc](https://fintel.io/ss/us/amc)

 Short Volume 61,535,474

The public float for AMC is 56.57M so that would mean more shares than available are shorted.

&amp;#x200B;

I might be retarded and doing this wrong so if anyone who understands this better than me wants to chime in please do.

Title: $F earnings today
The stock is enjoying great positive sentiment in the last few months and today is Q4 earnings which Deutsche believe will have a big upside.

In the last two weeks, there has been some negative factors that came into play, i.e the chip shortage, but it seems likely that this issue will be resolved in a week or two.

Now for juicy part, I believe the stock is now heavily shorted, and you know what happens when a heavily shorted stock get some great news right? 



Not an advice, your money your risk.

Title: Taxes and GME
Since the first one got removed because AM C is apparently a "penny stock" for the automotive now....

= = =

For those of you who feel as if you were left holding the bag on GME or AMC or whatever, do know that **as long as you hold onto these shares at LEAST 30+ days (give it 35 from the most recent just to be safe imo) you can write up to $3000 of capital loss off in your taxes next year.**

Anything after $3000 can be carried over to the year after.

So it is not a total loss and many people will eventually see their money back and this should probably ease quite a bit of the stress a lot of you are feeling from this ordeal.

The people who are in real trouble are the ones who are out tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, but this should at least take the sting out.

I would also like to state that there were warnings everywhere about not putting in more than you were willing to lose and the whole "Sir, this is a casino" thing was only a half-joke". It's just like Vegas and we all took a risk and many of us got burned as a result.

I'm a bag holder for $GME to the tune of $1700 average cost basis at 10 shares. Got excited and bought a two shares in the 200s and two in the 300s; but it was all money I was willing to live without if this didn't work out.

This additionally gives you further incentive to hold on for awhile and see how this whole thing plays out and how the subreddit situation falls. I'm going to continue to hold because of this. I've got nothing but time and who knows, maybe it will go back up and see a second surge and you'll be able to get out with at least minimal financial damage and take it as a lesson learned.

EDIT: /u/gallow_bob was kind enough to correct my limited understanding on the situation and replied with the following in my original comment.

&gt;	To clarify--you can reduce your income by up to $3000 a year for stock losses. I didn't realize the 30 day hold thing but that is very good advice. That doesn't lower your taxes by $3k--it lowers your taxable income by $3k--so depending on your tax bracket it will lower your taxes by $300 to ~$1k.

&gt;	If you have over $3k of losses you can roll that forward into the following years./u/

EDIT 2: as pointed out in the comments below the results of this will depend on your tax bracket.

I included several resources in the post to try to help guide you folks to doing your own research for your own means as I am not a tax expert or even a financial professional.

Title: The short hasnt happened.
They shorted 52 million shares, even if they paid back the shares at $80 (assuming a lower price that was recent for the sake of math)

Thats about 4.2 billion dollars, that wouldve definitely moved the share value. Its been a steady decline since the original spike.

Its just a dip

Title: OPTIONS VOLUME ON $SPCE
Just wanted to pop in and say that the hedgefunds shorting SPCE sold 32,000 $60 calls expiring tomorrow.

Title: A potential long term outlook on the situation
Hey guys. Like many of you, I was looking forward to the short squeeze as I bought into AMC the night before Robinhood restricted shares and we didn't ride the rocket to the moon together. I thought some of you may need some reassurance if the squeeze doesn't happen today, tomorrow, next week, or even in two weeks. I tried to piece all the information I could together in as logical of a manner as I could and feel free to correct me where you think I'm wrong or add onto my thoughts.

After I read through the Elon Musk tweet thread where he autistically said, "I am become meme, Destroyer of shorts" I realized that TSLA was probably diamond handed by a bunch of you apes and I wanted to confirm so I did some browsing and came upon this article. ( https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1mzy62nf393lw/The-Longest-Unprofitable-Short-I-ve-Ever-Seen ). I realized that TESLA in no way, shape, or form should ever be a stock worth over  $800 dollars because their revenue per year is only 20 billion and they produce 500,000 cars with a market cap of  $800 billion per year compared to say Toyota who posts revenue of 272 billion and yet have a market cap of a measly $185.4 billion. It is simply the result of a company that is performing well and is still squeezing shorts to this very day. 

Short selling is when a share is borrowed at market price (at whatever time it was borrowed) so they can sell the share at that price, and then cover the borrowed share when the price of the stock decreases so they can profit the difference. If we were to look at the chart of AMC's (the stock I'm diamond handing) Hedge funds must have short sold it at no lower than  $4 dollars because since the beginning of 2020, the stock had "peaks of around  $7.50 in Feb 2020,  $6.50 in June 2020, and  $4.30 in Nov 2020. In order to capitalize of short selling, they would try to buy in at the highest price possible in order to profit the most when they anticipate COVID would crash the price of AMC and potentially attack AMC enough to bankrupt them. Unfortunately, we love AMC. We've enjoyed movies since our childhoods at AMC theaters, had our first dates there, enjoyed time with friends and family bonding together in AMCs. The support of this community and many others willing to keep AMC afloat through this tumultuous COVID crisis kept AMC alive and their stock price MUCH higher than intended for the short sellers. The only website that shows me short interest from 2/3/2021 is ( https://www.thestreet.com/investing/top-stocks-being-shorted-by-short-interest-gamestop-gogo ) and GME and AMC's short interest are both very high. If you guys have more data I'd love to see it. 

Unfortunately right now with the SEC investigation of DFV, social media, and message boards such as WSB. Our interest in GME and AMC as an undervalued stock can't be shared as heavily with others because its thought of as market manipulation. After the investigation clears and DFV can return, and perhaps more public figures can come in such as Mark Cuban, Elon Musk, Chamath Palihapitiya, we can spread our DD for these companies that we know are highly undervalued.


Simply put, if we hold our shares, and AMC re-opens and starts to reflect its true value as a 15-16 dollar stock. The squeeze will occur from the shorts and they either can exit their position or they will continue to try to short and just keep running up their tab. In the end if shorts get squeezed, its just a transfer of capital from one to the next because a hedge fund bet on a company failing. 

tl;dr I like the stock and my hands are diamonds until I die

I own 560 shares at $14.09 AMC

Title: AMC movement. Thoughts?
AMC is dropping to nearly $7.00 a piece, which is coinciding with a drop in GME as thats nearly $50. I bought about 8 shares of AMC at around $10. Im holding, but if youre looking into getting AMC, buy either today or tomorrow. Im waiting to pull the trigger on GME until it gets closer to around $50 (hoping thatll happen around pay day). 

Whatre your thoughts?

Title: Retards. Never heard about support and resistance?
Its that simple. Open a Chart. Set the support and resistance lines and buy or sell to the right points. 90% of the new retards here never looked on a chart in their life. It would be less panic if you had the support and resistance lines visualised on your chart. Why buying and selling in the middle of a move? Why dont wait to sell until the support line is significantly breached to the downside? tHe MaRkEt iS gOiNg dOwN - yes of course you retard. Its natural for a market to pullback in a bullrun. After every fucking impulsive move. Even the little moves pulling back to get new energy. But in this markets we are trading right now, there are to many newbies that dosent even know something like that. i sOlD aNd tHe mARkeT is gOiNg uP aGaIn - thats your fault you retard. Look at the fucking support lines. Even in this irregular times of some markets, supports and resistances are major indicators to buy or sell. We would have a much better experience, if you would stick to some, not even many, technical rules. Some markets move crazy in the last few days/weeks. But it was getting just crazier as the retards joined who never heard or talked about trading in their entire life. They fucking panic to fast and this will not get better. Until you learn what the real meaning of technical analyses is. And yes, technical analyses is significant even in those markets. 

I hold some of those crazy stocks. But i invested so much that i was willing to lose. And I hold further. I tried to motivate you guys WITHOUT financial advises, funny charts and something. 

I know that here are some master retards who understand a lot about technical analyses and i guess, really sure, they know what they are doing. And they did very well i think.

This is a big please to everyone who never looked at a chart before he came here, please do some research. The functionality of support and resistance is learned in less than 30 minutes. You will realise how much this knowledge is worth while trading. Of course you cant profitabel trade without knowing them. 

Excuse my English, i am fcking German ape who anyways trys to reach people out here. 

This isnt any financial advise. Just do your research. You will make your life much easier in things like that. 

Less panic, more accuracy.

Title: Inovio: INO (Hold and buy, Don't Short this   )
I have been invested into this stock since early February 2020. I bought at an average price 2/14/20 $8.20, then sold at $30 in mid-June. A good gain right? But, I kept finding myself coming back to this company from research and news articles. Here is why I came back to invest back into Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc for a long haul: Bought 2500 shares @ $12.20 (would have bought more if funds)

This device is being developed in a phase 2/3 clinical trial now.

Essentially this device using low voltage to open your skin pores, so that the vaccine made be placed in the lipid (fat) portion of your skin. This allows for more direct placement of drug and more efficiency for immunization. 

If any of you were in the military prior to 2005, you would remember a device most commonly known as the "jet injection" gun. Essentially using pneumatic air to open the skin pores. The amounts of injections and immunization increased exponentially with the invention and use of this device. The reduction of plastics and needles was great too. Unfortunately, in Mid-2005 the Veterans Affairs put a stop to the devices, stating possible cross contamination exposure. Well, duh, in those days in the military they never would sanitize after each injection. I believe this CELLECTRA device from INO is going to be a revolutionary new method of immunization delivery. 

The other big reason this company is unvalued in my opinion. Inovio has been doing their research and discovery without the help of Big BioTech firms. They are the only independent biotech company I have found with a Covid-19 vaccine without the oversight or partnership of the big tech.

Happy Hunting.

Buy and Hold for your future.

Title: Best $400 lost in a long time.
This was by far a great learning experience. It was fun for a while. Then obviously. What is happening now. I jumped on the hype train. Bought a few stocks and paid attention to other plays. And lucky im not down much. 400 cdn. Monopoly money to most. yes. it sucked to lose it. But i look at it as. if i paid to take a coarse. it would cost more then 400. And no. Not saying im some pro now. But ive learned more in the last few weeks of lurking then any text book could teach. And the best way to learn is to get thrown into the fire and get burnt. The earlier in your career the better too.

Title: Who am I to say this but doesn't it seem a bit odd that there is only 1 view on GME around here
Literally the only thing I'm seeing around here is posts about holding and how everything is being manipulated, with not a single post about any opposing view. What's to say that GME won just keep crashing until it hits $10 and the hedge funds win? It's just that there doesn't seem to be any solid evidence that we aren't all collectively being screwed into holding a forever dropping stock.

Title: NOK Plays for 2021-02-04
So you're brand new to /r/wallstreetbets, you decided **$GME$** was a little too rich for your blood and you liked that **$NOK$** actually had some underlying value to support the price increase. Congratulations, you're slightly less retarded than half this sub and probably belong at /r/investing . You're already balls deep on calls/stock pickups, the price went down this morning after a positive earnings beat, and you think you're holding a loser.

Chill the fuck out.

**$NOK$** prior to 2021-01-22 was trading FAIRLY flat for the last year with price averages between **$3.30** &amp; **$4.60** (With some larger swings). What happened? Hype. Price shot up to $9.79, share buying was blocked, and paper hands took their tendies and ran.

So you're sitting here holding stock that's worth less than half of what you paid for it. What now? Dilute your shares and buy the dip. We've seen heavy support at the **$4.30** price target today and price swings up from this point. Set your limit order at this price and buy as much as you can afford. Is this proof you have a gambling problem? Probably.

Will the price ever go back up? Of course it will. Price targets for this stock are fairly consistently above current market price. While the entire market is retarded, you can't beat good fundamentals/[earnings beats](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nokia-nok-q4-earnings-revenues-151303550.html)/[market positioning](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nokia-nok-secures-key-deals-145002461.html)/[new technology](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/01/27/nokia-and-elisa-push-network-boundaries-with-worlds-first-1t-deployment/). Current consensus prices (from the conservative banks) put price target at **$5**, you'll make money even in the worst case. [Majority of firms prior to March 2020 doomsday held price targets between $7-$6 on the stock.](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/NOK/price-target/) This is **a rough 50% lift** from current prices.

**TLDR:**  

* Pick up **$NOK$** cheap on the dips (my re-entry has been at the $4.30 support point but pre-hype prices **~$4.20**)  

* Dilute your holdings if you're underwater (just keep pumping in money)  

* Chill out and watch the market capitalization this year  


**Positions:**  

* 4,424 Shares @ $4.34  

* 7,865 Shares @ $4.50

Title: GME confidence post
I'm not a financial advisor, I sort through crayon packages for the cherry flavour.

Looking at the VW chart people keep floating around it's hard to tell the day to day scale but what people don't seem to notice is that VW is that after jumping up $398 the price tanked hard to $210 right before the squeeze. BUT! That was 8 straight days of losses before the squeeze happened (Oct 16th - 24th).

When the price started to rise it didn't hit its peak until another few days and it stayed there for a few days (Oct 27 - 31).

I know this isn't exactly like the VW squeeze and there are different variables at play but the timeframes still lend to my point... This shit takes time! Everyone expecting this all to happen without any ups and downs need to chill the fuck out. This is just as stressful to everyone but you beautiful bastards are holding the line!

Pos:
51 GME averaged @ $176 

59 AMC averaged @$13.42


tl;dr: 

Title: So while we're holding GME and AMC with our compressed-carbon digits, here's a DD...
I've seen a lot of people talking about Cannabis stocks, so I wanted to volunteer a recommendation. 

A month or so ago I did the research and found GrowGeneration ([GRWG](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/grwg)) to be the best stock I could find in the category. Because it's a hydroponic supplier it's benefiting from the home-growers taking advantage of state-level legalization, and down the road once federal legalization kicks in (likely later this year) it will have a sharp increase in value from industrial level hydro as well.

Title: SPY go upppp
Been on a tare lately and this will continue especially with Stimmy on the way... 

Spy 450c April/May exp... enjoy your lotto ticket you degenerates...

Title: A sense of perspective
All these bots saying its going to go to 0 are melvin simps. Its not the intrinsic value before the shorts and the DFV info was $30 now with all the free advertising, New board and "goodwill" the realistic intrinsic value has to be raised to $35-40. Back of my hand numbers but you get the point.

I don't care what you bought at. The current price is $70, so your down side is $30 a share. However if the short information is correct (and we will see on the updated numbers fairly soon) there WILL be another gamma squeeze so the price is likely going to hit the highs we saw last week again so $450+. We can also have the upside of the short squeeze, which can go way higher.

So there is literally no point paper handing at this point. All you are doing is making gamma and short squeezes less likely. The upside (390 on a gamma way more on a short squeeze) vs downside (30 now) is massively in our favour! So even if you think there is 10% chance of it happening its a good bet. 

DFV and all the apes (which I am one) knows this and is still holding, I trust him more than some bots! If anything the bots just show how desperate the hedge funds are, Think about it, if they had covered why would they care whats happening now.

Title: You're an idiot if you don't have some WKHS in your stable
Positions: 55 shares @ $36.22 (Not a big position, but whatever, it's what I could afford.)

The Low-Down:

Workhorse ($WKHS) is an EV commercial truck manufacturer primed to moon. They're one of the finalists for the $6 billion USPS contract to replace the old, outdated postal trucks with shiny, new, sexy trucks. This contract was supposed to be awarded in December but got delayed. We can expect the results within the next month.

The two other finalists are Karsan, a truck manufacturer from TURKEY and OshKosh/Ford who are putting up an ICE truck (but have said they could pivot to an EV if required).

Now, the contract itself isn't for an EV truck however adding fuel to the fire (acid to the battery?) in support of WKHS is that Biden wants the entire federal fleet to be zero emission. This is great news.

Also, WKHS is based in Ohio, American made and a union company. If your pecker isn't half chubbed and saluting at those words, then honestly you're a pinko commie un-Murrican bastard. And you can bet your ass that is being factored into the decision as to who to award. You really think that they're going to give this money to the Turks? No, this administration knows it has to pay at least lip service to American manufacturing and union support. And honestly, as Americans, that's shit that we should be supporting, too.

Their debt is around 70 million right now, which pales in comparison to the money they'll be getting if (when) they get the USPS contract.

EDIT: Oh yeah, and their short interest (SI) is around 27%, which you idiots who got spoiled @ &gt;100% may scoff at, but is still pretty high in the normal world.

TL;DR - Don't be an idiot and sleep and WKHS. It's a great long-term play but I also believe it has potential for healthy short term gains.

EDIT 2: To put forth the other argument for why the OshKosh/Ford truck could beat out WKHS, so you see the other side of the argument: both OshKosh and Ford already have their tenterhooks in the government and definitely could win the contract. Also, as an astute person pointed out: the USPS currently doesn't have the infrastructure to support a full EV fleet, meaning that OshKosh/Ford's offering may be an easier transition. 

However, I don't think these necessarily weaken WKHS's position at all. Granted, I could be putting WAY too much stock in a cynical/political POV with this, but the way that I see it is that the contract is going to be 'weaponized' to be about more than just replacing the aged USPS fleet and will instead be something to tout as a green victory for the administration. Which I believe is overall a great step in the right direction and something we all should be happy about but let's be honest: decision makers understand optics and a PR release that says "USPS moving their entire fleet to 0 emissions" will play a lot better than "USPS adopts new truck. Plans to move to 0 emissions by 2030"

Title: CureVac - Vaccine Printer Go BRRRRR
Alright you retards, this subreddit seems to have become a place for $GME and nothing else lately, but since all the new autists arriving here have probably been losing their tendies on gamestonks, I thought I'd try giving some actual DD so people can make money instead of losing it.

So what's the play?  $CVAC, currently trading at around $111.50 a share, with a market cap of 19.71B.  They're in phase 3 trials of their covid vaccine right now and have been signing deals left and right, such as:

[https://www.media.bayer.com/baynews/baynews.nsf/id/Bayer-to-manufacture-mRNA-vaccine-in-Germany](https://www.media.bayer.com/baynews/baynews.nsf/id/Bayer-to-manufacture-mRNA-vaccine-in-Germany)

[https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-82224.html](https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-82224.html)

I'm expecting phase 3 trial results from them early next month, mostly based on this, which has the trial set to conclude on March 4th or 5th:

[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04652102](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04652102)

This is earlier than I expected, due to the trials being initiated on December 22nd to my knowledge, but maybe it's accurate?  Anyways, if any of you have followed Novavax ($NVAX), their stock price went to the moon a few days ago when they announced that their vaccine worked, and I'm anticipating a similar large move in $CVAC if their vaccine works.  From what I've read about their phase 1 and 2 results, and seeing large deals being signed each week now for distribution, I'm expecting phase 3 results to show that the vaccine works.

Now there is a counterargument to this, mainly that they already have a higher market cap than $NVAX, will be able to produce less of their vaccine, and their vaccine will have most likely have lower efficacy than $NVAX: [https://twitter.com/MedResCol/status/1355489429150986240](https://twitter.com/MedResCol/status/1355489429150986240).  Also obviously their vaccine might not work, but I don't think this is likely.

However, I am of the belief that they will exceed these delivery numbers and may engage in more partnerships to produce their vaccine candidate once it is proven to be effective.

Additionally, DADDY MUSK is in their corner, with Tesla having partnered with CureVac to develop mRNA printers capable of printing multiple different vaccines: [https://electrek.co/2020/07/03/tesla-joint-patent-curevac-revolutionary-bioreactor-for-rna/](https://electrek.co/2020/07/03/tesla-joint-patent-curevac-revolutionary-bioreactor-for-rna/)

When their phase 3 trial results are published and they shoot up like $NVAX printing tendies for all you're gonna be salty you didn't get in on that sweet action.

Positions: I hold calls for March 21 as well as shares, if you wanna be safer with guessing when their phase 3 results will be out maybe go for April 21 calls.  I'm poor so I don't have that many calls or shares, and I also lose money a lot so maybe this DD sucks.  If the SEC is watching, this is not financial advice, just my retarded DD

TLDR: Vaccine printer go BRRRR when they announce their vaccine candidate phase 3 trial was successful, likely early next month.

Title: GME spike isn't coming back folks. The brokers successfully killed it. Fidelity shows interest rate on shorted stocks has dropped from 30% last week, to just 18% today. Others are also reporting shares availability to borrow has increased. Personally, I'm still gonna hold cuz I've came this far.
I'm like 99% sure I should sell. Meaning, the squeeze has squoze. But I'm gonna hold just cuz its not much left to lose. Unfortunately all the random people popping off with their first time buys and YOLO'd lifesavings are in for some hard lessons. The volume indicates shorts have and are continuing to cover. I hope u/deepfuckingvalue posts some of his DD soon.

ATC (Atotech - further description below) is number one in its field by leading all competitors in fundamentals. It just IPOd today and is a very real stock with great long term and short term growth potential. Current share price is under 20$, and they havent released too many stocks into the public market.

Title: Gme! Updates!
Some updates on GME

Disclaimer: I am not a professional and this is not investment advice. I am long GME (216 shares cuz poor) and ing.

This post is for those of you who are new and asking about why people are still holding in this stock. It represents my personal opinion, often backed up by facts, but also including theorizing. This is all in addition to the original DD+updates, which can be viewed here:

[One DD to Rule Them All](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kz7ygv/gme_dd_one_dd_to_rule_them_one_dd_to_find_them/)

&amp;#x200B;

# 1) Institutional Ownership of GME is over 100% of the float.

Blah blah blah, what's the big deal? Well consider this for a moment. If we assume that these institutional shares are essentially not in daily play (not exactly true because some of them are shares held for smaller accounts or whatever, but ignore that because diamond hands probably hold an equivalent amount to that portion), and we go ahead and assume that those institutional shares cannot be bought to cover a short (which they can but not easily/not quickly)...then:

EVERY SINGLE SHARE TRADED ON THE MARKET IS A SHORTED SHARE THAT IS OWED TO SOMEBODY.

That's right, every single share traded on the market is ACTUALLY AN IOU. That's INSANE. And for every share we (as retail investors) buy, that's an ADDITIONAL IOU.

I literally can't overstate how insane this is. This isn't just a short squeeze where there aren't enough shares....there are literally LESS THAN ZERO UN-SHORTED SHARES TRADED. This goes so far beyond a liquidity issue, I honestly don't know how clearing houses are even functionally capable of obtaining GME shares anymore. This thing will explode soon, because every share bought is just compounding IOUs at this point (on avg, obviously).

Forget the moon.... to some kind of permanent orbit.

# 2) Price movement during the meteoric rises

On Monday, Jan 25th, we had some huge spikes but only slightly positive movement. On Tuesday Jan 26th, price slowly climbed at an almost perfect line. This, I believe, was some shorts carefully, slowly covering and/or retail buying excitedly and/or a gamma squeeze due to the unexpected situation where every call from the Friday before ended up being ITM. Then between Tuesday and Wednesday, price **SHOT up afterhours from $150/share to $350/share**. Bloomberg had an interesting article regarding how approx. only $45m was needed for this price movement. On Wednesday, Jan 27th, the stock essentially traded sideways, with some big volatility. Then on Thursday, Jan 28th, many brokers suddenly restricted the ability to buy GME and the price fell sharply, but then rose again with additional movement after hours (likely MM's covering the newly ITM calls before Friday, perhaps some shorts covering). On Friday, Jan 29th, a twitter account belonging to one "Kjetill Stjerne" who may or may not be a reclusive Viking billionaire, tweeted that they would "hold the line" in light of the brokers closing and posted a bash script with a piece including something like "hunt=shortsells". While nobody can confirm if this is true (though he was for sure someone early on the GME boat, we don't know if he's actually wealthy, etc), all of us who watched the Level II Data stream on Friday saw that many of the ladder attacks (aka, rapid share dumps and/or shorts, below ask price and sometimes below bid price) were suddenly stopped when compared to previous days, and the stock, while very volatile, closed at $325 (essentially, sideways movement again, but with huge spikes/dips) leaving lots of call options ITM.

After Friday, the stock dropped starting Monday. It closed Monday at 225, and Tuesday at 90. I believe this was due partially to people selling (and panic selling), but also due to people shorting. It's important to note that volume was HIGHEST DURING the Friday before last, and then last Mon/Tue. Once the stock rose above $325, volume stayed relatively low and dropped until Tuesday.

What does all this mean? My opinion is that the spike was artificial. Someone intentionally raised the price using afterhours movements (why? I can hand-wave and give some options...but it's all speculation), and opinion of the stock was high enough to sustain that high price for a little while. Once that was evident, brokers across the board suddenly restricted the ability to buy shares (not just Robinhood), likely due to increased clearinghouse requirements, thus locking out retail investors. I personally also believe the Viking was legit, and he's the reason the price stayed up on Friday in the absence of retail buying, but that's my personal opinion. Which brings us to discuss the broker restrictions:

# 3) Broker Restrictions

**IT IS CRITICAL TO NOTE THIS**[INTERVIEW](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/28/interactive-brokers-restricted-gamestop-trading-to-protect-the-market-says-chairman-peterffy.html)**:**  This chairman of IBKR, one of the brokers said this: "We are concerned about the ability of the market and the clearing systems, through the onslaught of orders, to continue to provide liquidity. And we are concerned about the financial viability of intermediaries and the clearing houses". In other words, there were so many shares of GME traded that it seems they were having **TROUBLE TO FIND THE SHARES and/or THE CASH TO BACKUP TRADES**. He also talked about how he "saw this squeeze going to infinity and so they stopped it to prevent losses". So brokers began to call margins on margin accounts, liquidating stock and options, sometimes very conveniently at the lowest price of a dip. E-toro "accidentally" set automatic stop-limits. Robinhood restricted buying to one share, etc. etc. All of which led to a drying up of the BUY side of the books, allowing the SELL side to push price down far more easily than normal.

# 4) Media Manipulation

It has become blatantly apparent that the news media is generally ignorant of the situation, whether willfully or not. From articles about the "short squeeze" in NOK or BB (neither of which is significantly shorted), to an endless litany of articles about how "reddit" or the "reddit army" has moved to Silver despite only a single post in the sub about it, or Biotech, etc. The silver one is my favorite because EVERYONE reported that...but it was practically absent from this sub. Smells really fishy.

Ever since Wed, Jan 13th, the media has been reporting that "the short squeeze has happened."

The best examples, in my opinion, is if you watch the "new" articles after doing a Google search of "GME." You'll find that in general, whenever GME starts to rise, there are suddenly "new" (not actually new but updated so that they look like they came out just now) articles bashing on Gamestop, retail traders, the "frenzy", WSB, or speculation in general. (my personal opinion, based on what I've seen)

# 5) Bot accounts

There's been a massive influx in this sub of [bot accounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lafh4d/in_case_you_needed_proof_that_there_are_imposters/) that seem to generally be negative on the GME situation.

&amp;#x200B;

These are a general summary of the reasons that people feel like it's still worth holding GME.

If the news article writers tried harder to find the truth (please, DM me, I'll help), instead of blatantly making things up (re: Silver squeeze, NOK squeeze, BB squeeze, other "next targets of Reddit", Qanon comparisons, etc);

if Citadel (a market maker) didn't give a loan to Melvin (a huge GME shorter);

if Citron research hadn't tweeted on Jan 19th that they would discuss reasons for shorting GME (**the next day**) just as GME dipped suddenly during a rise (and then postponed it because they forgot about the inauguration)...and proceeded to give REALLY unconvincing reasons.

if people didn't see evidence of attempted stock manipulation in this subreddit by new accounts;

if the price movements weren't extremely suspect and rapid;

if there wasn't constant reporting about "shorts have definitely already covered" for weeks;

if we hadn't seen hundreds of articles about how WSB traders could never understand the fundamentals (while I've seen more fundamentals in the DDs here than in any news article about GME);

Edit: if the GME and AMC graphs hadn't been paralleling each other for a week;

**if brokers almost across the board hadn't SUDDENLY restricted the ability for retail investors to BUY but not SELL shares and/or options**;

if institutional ownership wasn't over 100%, and shorters hadn't been so greedy as to short up to 138% of float (it's lower now, but it's still **insanely** high imo);

**and finally IF there wasn't a convincing turn-around story and evidence of it;**

**Then people (including myself) wouldn't be holding. This is my summary of what I feel are the pertinent points relating to GME atm. Feel free to buy, sell, hold the stock as you see fit, this is not financial advice.**

Don't ever buy stock/options with money you can't afford to lose.

Title: The case for Ericsson ($ERIC), A DD for Retards by a Retard.
  

Listen up retards, Im not the best at explaining so please bare with me. 

All this noise about Nokia when Ericcson is outperforming them makes 0 sense. Ericcson is cucking Nokia so hard that positive news about Ericcson raised buy ratings on Nokia.

[Nokia upped to buy after Ericsson results - MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nokia-upped-to-buy-after-ericsson-results-2021-02-01)

Ericcson has had some strong performance year over year due to 5G contracts and has actually somehow came out of last week better than it went in (currently $13.15 at my time of writing this).

Full disclosure, I own calls (for the 19th of both months) and stonks. Despite strength in the price action, it seems to have a ton of suits rooting against it. Looking on Marketbeat we can see a massive volume of short interest shares. UP 22% on a biweekly period on the closing months of last year alone!

[ERIC Short Interest Ratio (Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (publ)) (marketbeat.com)](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ERIC/short-interest/)

On my platform if I check options pricing, it seems a lot of the pressure is pushing from the top down into the $11 area, which I personally dont understand given the success and amount of contracts they have been signing in the past week alone.

Title: Short DD on STLA
Hey all, amidst all the GME madness, Id like to share a ticker I think could be great in the next few years. Its a little EV company called Stellantis (STLA). Stellantis is an EV manufacturing corporation with deals with companies such as FCA and Peugeot. It just recently opened for public trading on the market. They plan to have 39 different EVs made by 2022. 

What makes this pick so great in my opinion is, of course, Joe Biden. Not just Biden being there, however. Joe Biden has announced plans to convert the entire federal fleet into EVs. What company does the federal government use for the most part? Dodge, *which is owned by FCA*. With Stellantis very likely producing these EVs, we could see a very healthy surge in the companys value. 

Pretty short DD, I know, but I think this has the potential to be a great long term pick.

Title: Exciting hypothesis for a boring stock KO
I am fairly confident Topo Chico Hard Seltzer will be introduced during the Super Bowl. 

If you are unfamiliar this is Coca Cola's first forray into alcoholic beverages since the 80's, in an extremely hot segment, don't believe me? Check your wife's boyfriends pantry, its full of hard seltzers, and pregnancy tests.

Coca Cola, curiously, is vocal about them presenting zero ads themselves during the Superbowl, saying they're "excited to watch from the sidelines". This is not common for them to sit out the biggest event of the year.

Meanwhile Molson Coors, which has the exclusive rights to market Topo Chico in the US, has been vocal that they are 'introducing new products with an introductory ad campaign during the super bowl'. 

Topo Chico Hard Seltzer is already available in a few countries, and reviews are generally favorable, but if America is drawn to Topo Chico like an ape is drawn to emojis then we can see a huge lift in KO's stock price with this super bowl ad 'blitz' (haha!! Ha..)

Or, because I'm not a financial advisor and eat shit for breakfast, i could end up getting KO'd on my March Expiry 55c's (of which I've bought ten.)

Title: What's AMC worth?
Lots of posts here lately discussing the future (or lack thereof) of AMC Entertainment Holdings.  For a quick DD, let's compare their stats pre-pandemic and today:

**Pre-pandemic:** in January 2020, AMC traded around $7/share, and had a market cap of $700M.  19Q3 revenues were $1.3B.

**Now:** in January 2021 just before the recent runup, AMC traded around $2.5/share, and had a market cap of $400M, accounting for the successive share dilutions.  20Q3 revenues were $0.12B.

Their revenues fell 90% Y/Y, they have massive debt of over $5B, they've diluted their shares, and their cash flow is horrid.  Even if they ever get revenues back to pre-pandemic levels (which may take years, and they still have to make their debt payments), ***they'd be worth only $4-5 because of the dilution***, assuming the market will pay the same multiple as pre-pandemic.

Title: Tilray Exports First Shipment of Medical Cannabis to Spain
# Tilray has become the largest licensed cannabis producer in the world after its recent merger with Aphria.

* The company was also selected by the French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified medical cannabis products in France last week.
* Yesterday, it was announced that Tilray would become the first and only licensed cannabis distributor in Portgual.
* Tilrays EU campus is well positioned to capitalize on the demand trend in the EU and in other international markets and we will monitor how quarterly numbers reflect the increasing demand on a going forward basis.  
* Tilray and Aphria as a combined have the largest stake in Canadian cannabis market, and are ready to expand sales into the U.S once legalization continues.
* $TLRY is up **37%** in the past week, with an acquisition and full stock merger with $APHA inbound. 

As U.S federal legalization inches closer each day, TLRY seems to only be gaining momentum.  With a **25.74%** short interest, it may also be a contender for an upcoming short squeeze, similar to the one in 2018.

Alright degenerates, if you want to make some easy money in the long run. Start looking into DraftKings. Its not going to make you rich overnight but has the potential to double in price over the next year. 

Currently over $60 a share and having just been listed for public trading in July of 2019, they have already rocketed over 300%. 

They just expanded a partnership with Canada for NFL fantasy sports. 

Online gambling is the future and more and more states are going to be legalizing it in the future. If the 3 big states New York, California, and Texas legalize online sports betting that will be a 30 billion dollar increase in the industry. 

Earnings is 2/26 so plenty of time to ride it up. Not to mention how many people are going to be using DraftKings this weekend for the SUPERBOWL!

I have been confused by the drop, but now I understand. The rise, Im not talking the little one, but the big one from the $40s to $300-400 I am certain was Melvin closing their position on this run up. 

We already know it was shorted heavily at the top, which is why so many people felt they got burned. Stupid . 

Unless this goes back to where it was before...and Im talking sub $20, then the shorts are still heavily under water, paying interest every single day.

So Melvin had a small short position, and now the remaining HF have an even bigger short position than they did previously, wow, even my wifes boyfriend doesnt talk that dirty to her when I watch, this has me so hard.

Title: Pure Cycle Technologies
Alright for all of you newcomers. DD for a company I believe in and you should too. 

Pure Cycle Technologies is about to ipo in a merger with $ROCH and has the ability to be one of the big boys in the chemical and recycling market. Reasons listed below. 

1. Patented technology to recycle polypropylene into virgin plastic pellets. Ive researched this and their process has little to no byproducts other than water and co2. Patent was developed by proctor and gambil. Bunch of ex P&amp;G guys founded the company. Their tech has been listed by Time and a few chemical and recycling publications as one of the top inventions of 2019. 

2. Proven to work via a pilot plant demonstration and full plant being built right now. 

3. They have already sold the first 10 years of product in special agreements from multinational corporations. 

4. They have raised stoopid amounts of money from big industry in a very short timeframe. Market cap starting out at around 1 Billion. 

5. We got Biden as a president and the push for a greener world is on the forefront of a lot of the agenda. This could be one of the big forces in recycling. More plants being built around the world.

Title: Time to Buy a Real Stock : AMD (Kill The Shorts Part 2)
I know weve had our fun with GME and Im sure it still has a shot to go up. However, let me re-introduce you to a real stock: **AMD**. 

At $88 a share, were looking at massive upside. And instead of buying GME at $83, why not buy something that actually has some long term value? Oh and did I mention its one of the most shorted stocks this month? [https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/most-shorted-stocks](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/most-shorted-stocks)

**Thats $6.7 billion in short interest.** Thats larger than the actual current market cap of GME. Lets actually make a dent here. These fuckers **added 17% more shorted shares** in the last month. You're gonna tell me their diamond hands are better than OUR DIAMOND HANDS ?

As our savior Elon Tweeted today : I am become meme, destroyer of shorts.

[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1357269755112148993](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1357269755112148993)

Lets make him proud.

Ok, now for some DD so you guys know Im not talking out of my ass.

# Fundamentals:

Their latest ER:

**Crossed $3 billion in sales threshold for the first time, INCREASING YOY by 52%**

**Full year sales of $9.76 billion**

Server revenue doubled year over year which is absolutely incredible because that means they are actually going toe to toe with the big boys like IBM.

Massive increase in guidance. Theyre **expecting 37% growth** this year.

So why did they drop from their ER? Well, it was because of next-gen chip shortages through the first half of 2021. But lets be real here, this is a joke compared to the issues Intel is facing with their next-gen.

Obviously, wed prefer if they never had a shortage, but I mean if youre gonna have a problem it might as well be this one. This news is LITERALLY SAYING, hey we have too many orders and we cant keep up sorry, well get it to you ASAP

Imagine thinking this company isnt going to bounce back and go to new ATH in the next month or two.

Our queen, Lisa Su, said there will be added capacity in the second half of the year. This is perfect, because that means by the time next holiday season comes around theyll be good to go. I wouldnt worry about these shortages. They are running at full capacity and we should expect their sales to increase throughout the year.

**Some loser (**u/aatop**) decided to call out Market Share issues in my last post so here's a section just for him:**

Intel gained back 0.7% of market share in Q4 across the CPU market as a whole. Whoop de doo!

**In the last month ALONE, AMD gained back 3%.** Here's a little business lesson. Ups and downs happen. No growth company is going to have growth every single month/quarter. I don't care who they are. There are hiccups. Don't let some negative nancys make you believe that a hiccup means AMD's market growth is ending.

**AMD actually GAINED on Intel in the CPU server secto**r. What does that tell you? That **boomers are actually converting to AMD** for their company. And we all know that these boomer companies have all the money for now.

# Technicals:

For those of you who care about lines on a chart, I got you as well.

We really have two things to look out for. We have a resistance (that used to be a strong support) at 88. But were basically there right now.

In addition, the last few weeks before ER, we were in that 89-97 channel. What does that mean? Well, once we get going here **AMD will shoot up to $97 and from there we can retest ATH.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/49t9dzxqghf61.png?width=1988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a45e5768cdd5fad74cfa67b2544f46065135d47

For more squiggly lines, the MACD is about to cross the signal line so we could see some bullish sentiment here. And of course the RSI is near the bottom of the range, but honestly who cares about that anyway.

# Conclusion/TLDR:

My point is that more than half of you fuckers run AMD in your machine anyway and the other half is waiting for their stimulus check to buy the new Ryzen series. The new investors here are all sad from GME, but now its time to put your big boy pants on and get into something that has some real value behind it. You got questions? Leave em in the comments and Ill answer.

Title: They are counting on you to get bored
Listen dirt sniffing apes. What are 2 things that distinguish our generation? (Gen Z and Y). First, that we are retarded, obviously, but also that we are extremely autistic.

Ok, but on a serious note now, we stand out for first, liking and contributing to hype things. We like flash content, we binge-watch series, we love new things, we love change, we cant last more than 2 years in a job, we are in movement.

Second, we get bored easily, it goes hand in hand with the first point but when stuff lasts too long or has no hype or movement, we leave it, move on.

That is exactly what the hedgies are counting on. What do you think they did the whole weekend while we were eating crayons and buying fucking billboards all over the world? They made a plan, they hired psychologists, historians, even fucking zoologists to figure out what to do with us.

Some say short ladder attacks are fake, others say the opposite, some say they had to buy the $320 ITM options that expired Friday but didn't others say they did, what the fuck ever man. We know what the strategy is and we always knew, JUST FUCKING HOLD.

They count on you getting bored, they count on you expecting easy money and leaving empty-handed, they count on you to YOLO money you actually need cause if this shit lasts 1 month everyone will be selling cause they have to pay their bills.

A real revolution is not about hype, it's about conviction, a real revolution is not about winning, its about change. We knew we were taking the Hedgies money, just that some of us lost their ground and thought we would bankrupt institutions with trillions of dollars in just 5 days, Diamond Hands are not people who buy and hold during volatile moments, Diamond hands are those who know what they are doing, know what they are up against, and are not in for easy money. Why do we admire DFV, cause he turned 50k to 40M? Probably, but mainly because he saw this shit coming from a year ago and he has been Diamond Handing this shit all the way through.

At the end of the day this all started because we believe in GME, we believed in Ryan Cohen, and we believe in each other.  Rome wasn't built on a day and Wall Street for sure wont fall in one. But if we focus and not get bored for a fucking change the Hedgies will come begging for our shares sooner or later.

Im all in on this shit and I won't sell, maybe ill buy more if the stock goes under 20 bucks or something like that. But at the end of the day, they are still short, they are still paying interest, GME is actually improving as a company and this revolution is still on the move. Dont let your guard down.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Focus, they want us to get bored, to leave and let the hype define our decisions, we know the fundamentals, we know the math, and we know our DD. This could last a week, a month, or a year, but DFV held, so can you. This is your chance to invest in that stock that "would have made you rich if you invested x amount x time ago" this is that chance, dont waste it. HOLD and all good things will arrive in due time.

I'm from Mxico but due to the SEC fucking around with the sub I just want to remind you this is not financial advice, I am a Mexican ape and like to comer caca todo el da.

Title: Here's the best job I can do of an unbiased perspective on GME
By now, a lot of people are going around saying GME is done. Maybe not on here, but on other social media platforms this is definitely true. I want to take my best shot at an unbiased outlook on GME.
As many of you know, the short interest report is released next Tuesday. When it's released, we will see either one of 2 things:

- Short interest will still be unreasonably high, sinking bloombergs news article claiming short interest was at 33% [This article had no basis for this claim, but I imagine some people may have fallen for it], and we may very well see the squeeze 2.0.
- Short Interest will have dropped below 80%, possibly causing a panic sell-off, even if people claim that Melvin are messing with the numbers

Personally, I think we'll see short interest above 100% still, but until next Tuesday, all we can do is speculate. Until then, I don't think GMEs done, but people are doing a very good job of shitting on Gamestop.

Title: Boeing Semi Retard DD
Boeing stock has been crushed since the MAX.

&amp;#x200B;

However, there are several reason I think it will be over $400 in the next 2 years.

&amp;#x200B;

1) max is resolved, certified and safe to fly

2) air travel is on the rise

3) they have indicated plans to finalize the 797 clean sheet design to replace the 757 that was in limbo for years.

They have shaken up management to get back on track and be the company they once were.

&amp;#x200B;

in at $211 and holding.

Title: Thank You for The Dip 
A few days ago I tried to buy GME at $292 and Robin Da Hood, said "fuck off." So the next day I came back and bought a share for $390. It was only only one share, didn't feel like much, but I am going to hold until my skin decays off my diamond bones. 

And now today with the dip, I've been able to buy 2.5 shares, more than tripling my investment. Thank you fellow apes.

Hold the line. Hold forever.

Title: Weed stocks are about to explode
[The senate ](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/cannabis-reform-senators-say-they-will-push-pot-bill-in-2021.html) has stated they will be voting on ending the federal marijuana prohibition this year. According to Schumer this is a top priority of congress. With a majority in the house and the senate plus the White House this is almost a sure thing to pass. This would be extremely popular with the citizens and would most certainly help democrats gain more popularity and keep their majorities safe on elections. They have full incentive and ability to do this. When this happens weed stocks are going to explode. 

There is no real timeframe on this however I found one [quote](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-urges-marijuana-reform-in-meeting-with-ag-pick-garland-and-other-doj-nominees/) that states In the early part of this year, we will release a unified discussion draft on comprehensive reform to ensure restorative justice, protect public health and implement responsible taxes and regulations. I would recommend buying as much stock as you can, buying more on dips, and going long on options. God speed retards.

Title: Let GME tank, stop wasting your capital and let it tank, then buy back in at 20$ with more shares and less cost basis
The short interest is still high and cant be erased because there arent enough shares. The shares the shorts borrowed and lent out again and again are counterfeit. Institutions have counterfeit shares and we might too 


#LET THE PRICE TANK DONT BUY THE DIP AND STOP PROLONGING THIS. Once it tanks we all buy the dip and they have less shares

$FUBO sentiment is very very high on Twitter. They've got streaming rights to the Superbowl this weekend and they also have some of the highest short interest on the market (around 70%, will update with [source](https://imgur.com/cCeadA4). Could be an opportunity to squeeze. Highly recommend looking around twitter to see more details and charts from people who are better at using crayons than me.

Title: CBOE Earnings DD and Yolo
Alrighty boys, CBOE Yolo and DD 

What is the CBOE? **They are the ones who own your options contracts** and get their sweet sweet 65 cents, no matter the direction. VIX? Yep, they own that too. With option volume overtaking share volume for the very first time in history just one month ago, you would think the monopoly on equity and VIX options would have made new ATHs. 

**It hasn't.** Instead, it's sputtered about and is still 30$ off its 52 week high. Where this gets interesting are the excerpts from the CBOE January 2021 statistics: 

1) Cboe Global Markets' four options exchanges set a new single-day volume record on  January 27, with 18.5 million contracts traded.

2) Cboe Volatility Index options (VIX) was more than 662,000 contracts, up 34 percent from  January 2020 , and up 68 percent from  December 2020.

3)ADV on each of Cboe's four options exchanges increased compared to a year ago: Cboe Options up 28 percent, Cboe BZX up 85 percent, Cboe EDGX up 82 percent and Cboe C2 up 52 percent. ADV across each of the exchanges also rose compared to  December 2020.

Premiums for calls just 2-3% OTM for tomorrow's earnings are less than 0.40 a contract. Keep in mind that returning to its 52 week high would be a 25%+ jump. Load up on this sleepy goldmine boys.

Title: Ford: It's a data company now?
TLDR: Was in Ford for that EV money coming in from the government, but the Google Deal opens up another revenue stream.

Positions: 230 $15c Jan 2022

https://preview.redd.it/quhsl8g03hf61.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b1b2bda4d0ecf816f47d8986b8dd241603ea2e7

First of all, fuck the suits and GME  I have 3 shares at $300 and I just want to see all the short sellers get burned. But for a core position, Ford isn't bad.

**It's a value stock**. Ford is extremely cheap. From 2008 onwards, and again in 2020, Ford has a company that has been left to die. It is also an industrial, which puts it in the realm of boring companies that will benefit from the rotation of it does come.

If you want to talk fundamentals, PE is something around 8x right now, which makes it in the same realm of freaking Tyson Foods, which last I checked, was responsible for taking things off a carcass, putting it into small bags and selling it for 79c/lb for autismos to REEEEEEEEE over.

If you want to talk options, dude the underlying is basically $10. That makes options cheaper. And the IV is basically 30-50% on reasonable strikes and exps (say 10% OTM 1mo, 20% OTM 2mo etc). This means for a single GME option (I don't care which one), you can have anywhere from 100-500 of F ones. People dumping their entire life savings on 20c options is what the sub was built on.

**Gubmit money**. This is nothing new ([meaning we saw it during the Obama era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_incentives_for_plug-in_electric_vehicles#United_States)). You bet there will be incentives for both companies and consumers in the September budget. This also has the tailwinds of Biden's "plan" of buying all American and electric for the Federal fleet. Ford will absolutely lowball the shit out of everyone else because that's what Ford does when faced with these [morally-questionable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Pinto), [profit-enhancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestone_and_Ford_tire_controversy) situations. Ford these past few weeks have been trading like a green company like Sunrun and a few others. Yes GM will probably do the same thing, but GM doesn't have this next point which changes the situation.

**So what if it can become a tech company?** Yeah, it's never going to happen. I would never buy a phone from Ford for example because you know Ford can find a way to make the plastic rust. But the [Ford-Google dea](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/ford-and-google-sign-six-year-deal-for-android-in-car-apps-cloud.html)l goes beyond just installing android on cars. Ford will absolutely sell user information to Google (kinda like how RH sells it to Citadel). Google wants this information because it wants to get into the self-driving car business, and the deal allows it to leapfrog TSLA by not having to build their own cars, network and ecosystem. The data is probably more valuable since you have a wider view of the entire US driving demographic.

GM does not have this. GM does not have anyone to prostitute their driver data to. Sure, GM can do that, but GM is expensive and their small cars business will be absolutely killed by the deluge of new small EV manufacturers over the years.

So... don't do anything crazy like $15c March 2021 because there will be no GME-esque short squeeze (even though yeah VW was a car company and earnings are this afternoon). A 40% gain over 11 months is very reasonable. And again, the options are very cheap ($1.50).

**Risks, disclaimers etc etc:** Hi Mr. SEC, this is not financial advice. I do not drive a Ford because I don't want to be stranded on the side of the road. Apple car might lead to a drop in Ford but thankfully in the US, Ford has stopped producing small cars. If I lose it all, please feel free to find this post again and drop an F in the chat.

Title: Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings (AAWW) - Stock poised for breakout, and is relatively unknown, but certainty worth your time looking into with multiple catalysts for earnings this month.
Hello Fellow Autists, I have an opportunity I wish to present to you that. 

The company is Atlas Air (AAWW).  This article is an earnings play on a strong company that is not in mainstream media. If you wanna get straight to the point, just go to the end of this write up. 

Atlas Air Worldwide is a leader in global airfreight, that serves freight, commercial, charter, and military customers. If you ever had an iPhone or PlayStation 3-5, or watched a San Diego Chargers game you've probably been impacted by Atlas Air. They have a combination of an efficient fleet, cost-saving operations, and superior customer service. With nearly 3,600 employees working across 90 countries, Atlas Air generated 2019 net sales of $2.74 billion.

They provide ACMI (Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance, and Insurance), whereby they provide outsourced cargo and passenger aircraft operating solutions, including the provision of an aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance, while customers assume fuel, demand and price risk. In addition, customers are generally responsible for landing, navigation and most other operational fees and costs;.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Flying our tendies as you read this](https://preview.redd.it/2couglpv6hf61.png?width=450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cddd29a8ec3d6c527bbfc8ec8b32226525a58251)

The company recently strengthened and diversified its business and fleet with a focus on serving express and e-commerce, which has positioned it well to handle the increased demand in online orders and the future distribution of vaccines. In the third quarter, management saw strong demand for their long-haul wide-body services. The company anticipates solid volumes in the fourth quarter, driven by continued e-commerce growth. They recently made a deal with Alibaba (BABA) to send their consumer's merchandise to South America and allowing them to grow operations there.

The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 7.69. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 15.53. Their biggest competitor is Air Transport Services group (ATSG) who even though has a bigger market cap, higher P/E ratio of 15.97, also happens to have a smaller fleet then Atlas Air and does not have the 747-800 which is the newest model of the 747 and most fuel efficient while carrying more weight which in this industry is crucial and helps them stand out from their competitors.

They just bought 4 more 747s to add to their fleet. 

A resistance level has formed in the chart of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. If this level is crossed, a breakout could occur and has been at the same levels since November.

AAWW saw strong earnings and revenue growth in the third quarter with earnings up 667.6% year over year and revenue up 24.9%. The stock is trading at a low valuation with a Price to Sales ratio of 0.5 and a Price to Book ratio of 0.7.

The companys cash position for the third quarter was $718 million, up from $72 million in the same quarter last year. Though that is considerably lower than its long-term debt of $2.4 Billion. AAWW has shown strong long-term momentum, but is down over the short-term.

**There are multiple catalysts that could cause this stock to break out.**

The first one is the fact that the company is being apart of the vaccine distribution and is expected for the next year to help distribute the vaccine because their aircraft can support and hold the refrigerators to carry the vaccines since they have to be kept cold.

Second catalyst. Atlas Air has a partnership with amazon where amazon leases their fleet to transport all their shit all over the world. With the epidemic and amazon growing like crazy this has only lead Atlas Air to grow. Amazon has warrants to buy up to 23% of the company by end of 2023. And its Christmas and I have a feeling Christmas records for Amazon are about to be shattered which means Atlas Air will be busy. Also typically around Christmas through February is the company's busiest time of the year even without

Third catalyst. Growth. Atlas Air is adding to its fleet (Just bought 4 more 747s) and is hiring more pilots to tackle the tasks at hand. Also passenger airlines typically when doing international trips hold additional cargo in their hull to make more profits, but with less international flights due to Covid Atlas Air has had growth in customers asking them to hull freight. And assuming Atlas Air does good with these customers and makes them happy their clientele should expect to grow.

Forth catalyst. Gasoline is pretty cheap, even though it is rising in price with vaccine news, it is still much cheaper then previously before for aircraft.

Fifth Catalyst maybe? As the coronavirus chaos is beginning to come to an end and super sexy overvalued tech companies are no longer as attractive this can lead to an emphasis on value and funds will be longer for their next growth prospects and this provides opportunity for value and growth and a way to capitalize off the coronavirus vaccine, amazon holiday season, and a ever changing world.

Sixth catalyst if you go into long term calls....every time there is a war Atlas air booms because the military hires them to fly out to the middle east and shit is stirring up in the Middle East right now.

**Passenger Airlines are responsible for 40% of air freight before covid...imagine what the earnings report will look like after this busy holiday season.** 

To summarize, this is a well ran growing company and the stock price is poised for a breakout with a combination of these catalysts. The company is no where near its all time high yet it is the best it has ever been financially. The company is also owned over 90% by institutional investors so there is lots of smart money in the company who recognize value and the next earnings report is this month on the 18th and this company tends to have a run up towards earnings.

Literally Can't go tits up.

Large thrusters

SPCE appears to be up, so does TSLA, and AMZN - all companies invested with space exploration with large thrusters

Positions: 
$NOK $10 calls - any expiry

NOK also beat earnings today, which improves their chance at securing funding for these large thrusters.

EDIT 1:
Nothing has ever broken a Nokia phone, why should the market?
It is important to note that today, Nokia can be purchased for an extreme discount.

[Chart](https://i.imgur.com/tzNXdnn.png).

That was then, this is now, here's what we know:

* Wall street is rigged
* The buy pressure momentum got castrated mid climax 
* The shorts shorting at $10 probably got out at a loss, new shorts probably entered in the upper ranges and made bank
* The cost to all short holders is significantly depressed at the current market price. [Cheap shorts are available](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME).
* If there was a day of reckoning when shorts all had to buy-in at once it would certainly be ugly, the numbers don't lie, there are a lot of shares short out there that may be impossible to cover
* The only way for a buy-in to happen is upward momentum caused by buy-pressure
* Unless you guys have a bottomless money pit or major market participants enter that's probably not going to happen
* No matter how much you shame each other and throw away your life savings there is no guarantee that the price spikes again
* Don't turn this into a ponzi scheme

Can we talk about something else now?

Title: Why GameStop trading at $400 is fair
I commented this on a different post and thought I'd make it a post in and of itself.

I am basing this statement loosely on Chewy valuation which is around 43b (I know they are different companies but hear me out). 

First of all. Brick and mortar is dead so the turn to e-commerce is a move away from sudden death and a great growing opportunity, and with the help of talented individuals (Cohen, Amazon dude and such) they can really do this right.

Both Chewy and GameStop have (had) Cohen on the board and are operating in a growing market catering to a specific kind of customer (with games/e-sports being just as big or perhaps even bigger than pets). 

People like to be catered to by others that know what they're talking about, which is a growing trend. Remember, Amazon also sells pet products, however, Chewy found a niche and targets these customers directly with their own specific product.

Would you like bread from an official bakery using the best products or would you like prepackaged bread from the factory? The prepackaged food will do fine, but the bread from the bakery is just better. This same analogy can be applied to Amazon v GameStop. Chewy has proven this argument right.

This, together with the recognizable name, is why I see this trading at around $400 (in a few months/years) which would give it a valuation of around 30b.

 for multiple years for me. This is not investment advice, I just truly like the stock.

Title: A fantastic ETF trade (FTSE100 ETF but Americans can/should get involved too)
Ok autists, please be gentle (as you can be) as this is my first DD  having had double my usual adderall dose this morning (prescribed btw) Im ready to write my magnum opus.

Obligatory Disclaimer 1  this has nothing to do with GME, Im not encouraging anyone to divest their GME holdings. This is a medium-term play anyway so all you GME holders without extra cash can wait to see your short squeeze thesis play out and then come into this in a few weeks or whenever. Oblig Disclaimer 2  this is not financial advice of any kind, please do your own research. I am not a financial advisor, I do work in the US as a risk quant for a pension fund (not a hedge fund) but the fund does not invest in any of the below and I personally make no investment decisions, hence being able to post this.

Brief bit of info/background on me  Im a cross-Atlantic cross-breed, i.e. an American-British kid. 30 years ago my dad went to the US on business and met my mom who was working as a cocktail waitress (no she wasnt a stripper or working at Hooters before you ask). Im also 30 years old myself so draw your own conclusions about my backstory (just keep them to yourself pls). Oh yeah, as a kid a child psychologist diagnosed me as mildly on the spectrum (for real) but I think she was full of shit really. Other than that Im a pretty boring/ordinary guy generally. My investment thesis is anything but boring however.

Moving on to the idea (you dont care about me or my backstory anyway). Actually before then lets talk a bit about the UK (or England as you Americans always call it in movies). Im sure you guys think us Brits all sit around in tweed coats drinking tea and acting like Hugh Grant or the cast of the Crown, but in reality the UK today is pretty Americanised (London anyway). London is also the biggest financial centre in the world after New York, our banks are up there with your big boys JPM, Citibank etc. Also Oxford University (rivaling Harvard) just invented a Covid vaccine.

So onto the investment. Currently I have a significant amount of my portfolio in a 3x leveraged ETF in the FTSE 100 (index of the largest 100 UK companies, equivalent of your Dow 30 really). As a British (as well as American) citizen, I can trade this domestically on Hargreaves Lansdown, but Im sure you guys have access to various ETFs that give you the same exposure (Wisdomtree for example).

Despite the vaccine and strong recovery/quantitative easing, the FTSE 100 is still down -20% from its pre-Covid peak, in stark contrast to the DOW or S&amp;P 500 which is at its all-time high. So why is this? Good question  lets look at some of the biggest constituents of the FTSE 100:

\- BP  remember these guys, the villains from the Deepwater Horizon movie? Remember John Malkovich in his bad Southern drawl saying we are a $115bn company? Well currently their market cap is $50bn, so theres huge potential upside. Yeah sure electric cars are coming along, but in reality oil is going to be still needed for a helluva long time, especially once air travel comes back. Plus oil is also used in plastics and pretty much every consumer material out there, its going nowhere anytime soon.

\- Royal Dutch Shell  same as above, except they dont have a movie about them starring Mark Wahlberg

\- HSBC  seventh-largest bank in the world. Up until recently their share price was the lowest its been since 1995, despite these guys making bucketloads of money in normal times. Also if HSBC ever go under, that means the world financial system has basically ended. So this investment not working out will be the least of your issues

\- Barclays  same as above, except they dont have any issues/concerns with being exposed to Hong Kong/China. Also their investment bank has been making out like bandits this year due to the volatility. No idea why the share price is so low.

\- Lloyds Banking Group  as above, another autist made a good DD post on here about LBG recently. Look that up as the adderrall is wearing off so cant be arsed to repeat what he said.

\- IAG/British Airways  huge airline thats obviously struggling right now. But they have tons of cash and will definitely make it out of this crisis. Also down around -50% from pre-Covid highs.

\- Unilever  the guys who make soap and washing-up liquid. Everyone will always need these (well maybe not the filthy autists on here like me)

\- AstraZeneca  they just invented a highly effective Covid vaccine. Enough said.

\- BHP  huge miner, $200bn valuation. They are actually trading above their pre-Covid highs but likely have more room to grow.

\- British American Tobacco  the Covid pandemic hasnt cured addiction, people wont stop smoking anytime soon. If anything it might go up as people are stressed by the pandemic.

The above are just a few (the biggest) examples of amazing value stocks in the FTSE 100. Of course this is WSB not r/investing, so we need some additional risk. Thats why I would suggest a leveraged ETF, to amplify your returns. (Disclaimer  leverage also amplifies your losses, please dont invest money you cant afford to lose).

Ok, you say, well what about the white elephant in the room i.e. Brexit? Well this is WSB not r/politics, so I wont say that Brexit was a monumentally stupid decision by our elected leaders. But whilst Brexit will undoubtedly cause pain for the UK economy as a whole, the impact is mainly on smaller companies and businesses. Most of the constituents in the FTSE 100 are $5-10bn+ companies, for example banks are big enough that the legal expense of setting up a European entity is minimal (so they still get unfettered access to the single European market). So FTSE 100 companies shouldnt feel much pain from Brexit in my opinion, at least not enough to affect this thesis.

Well what about the exodus/brain drain of finance and other professionals to Europe, you might ask? Well Paris is nice but French labour laws mean you can basically never be fired or made to work late, which doesnt really work for most big companies. Frankfurt is a strong contender to London except its one of the most boring cities out there. Imagine moving from New York to Fargo, North Dakota  except that everyone in Fargo spoke a different language (although judging from the TV show it seems like they may do anyway). Thats what it would be like for someone moving from London to Frankfurt (sorry Germany/Fargo).

Ok, so whats the risk level of this trade? Well tbh I would say the risk/reward ratio is really good  with a leveraged ETF you could conceivably make 100%+ returns in the next few weeks/months. And thinking about it this is really almost risk-free  if the FTSE 100 tanks or stays low for the next year or two, in reality that means were all still sheltering inside and now living in the monstrosity of a film that was Michael Bays Songbird (plotline  Covid has mutated to be 90% deadly and we are all still in lockdown in 2024). So at that point youll probably be scavenging for food/focused on survival, even if money still exists I can guarantee you wont be upset about any money you lost on this trade.

Oh yeah, also the FTSE 100 was down almost 9% last month (January). So investment timing is also on your side if you go into this in the near-future.

Autist out (again - pls do your own research this is all just my opinion/autism)

**TL;DR:**

\- Leveraged FTSE 100 ETF is a great way to make 50-100%+ returns over next few months with pretty low risk. Consists of huge oil companies, investment banks that arent going anyway but still down -50% from their peaks (for no other reason than were Britpoors)

\- If this goes tits up then were probably all still quarantined and living in Michael Bays Songbird world in 2 years time, so money will be the least of your worries

\- Timing is on your side, the FTSE 100 dropped 9% last month for no discernible reason

\- Brexit is a risk but not that big an issue for these very large companies (see above in the detail)

\- If you dont invest in this then you just dont like money

\- GME holders dont need to panic as this is a medium-term trade over a period of weeks (or even months) so plenty of time to hold your GME if you so choose and come in on this later

\- This is not financial advice and I'm not a financial advisor. Pls do your own research, this is all just my own opinion/autism.

Title: Silver Shiny Me Likey (Read disclaimer b4 downvote GME gang)
**\*This post is about physical silver, not the ETF's or futures contracts**

**Hello SEC! Thank you for reading my due diligence on Silver. Please note I am not inciting a short squeeze I'm just telling people that I like SLV and why they should consider liking it too. I am not a financial advisor and we are all individuals acting of our own accord. If you want someone to investigate try investigating the hedge funds and corrupt brokers.**

&amp;#x200B;

Before GME gang downvotes:

Listen up this isn't r/GME this is r/wallstreetbets I know you have your battles to buy but we shouldn't miss out on SLV just because you guys like GME still. OF course dont sell GME to buy SLV just hold and wait for the squeeze but we must recognise that SLV is ACTUALLY a legit play.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to check that i'm not a robot send me captchas and ill do them for you

&amp;#x200B;

Recently there have been a few posts about SLV, but I tried to wait until the GME hypes has died down to post this. This DD will be split into two parts:

1. Why SLV in on itself is a good and safe investment (Boomer DD)
2. Why SLV has moon mission potential (WSB DD)

**We should not miss the silver play just because we are currently in GME. You guys may not know this but its actually possible to hold more than one type of stock at the same time.**

**The Boomer DD (Source: goldsilver.com)**

*Why silver is a good investment*

Silver cannot be created out of thin air. It cannot be printed.

Silver has no counter-party risk. Physical silver does not rely on another party making good on their contract. Silver also outperforms Gold in bull markets.

&amp;#x200B;

[Gold vs Silver](https://preview.redd.it/bjnbtrtjpgf61.png?width=1386&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4536c7c77ab04631c9de08daf8caae9dc2c6ba11)

Government inventories of silver are also falling. Since silver does have industrial uses, in the future these industrial demands will be difficult to meet. This is because governments no longer hold large stockpiles of silver due to the fact that they no longer need the silver to make coins.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8uf985knpgf61.png?width=1388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41c26d5a8d97396556e07a1c9b5d218660cac6da

&amp;#x200B;

Silver use in industrial production is also increasing.

There is silver in cell phones, things like self heating windshields, as a catalyst for the production of plastics and chemicals etc.

One key use of silver is its use in photovoltaic cells, which is the main constituent of solar panels. So silver is also a solar energy play. With Biden taking office, we can expect more production of solar panels and thus an increase in demand for silver that governments cannot fulfil.

Photovoltaic cells are those little tiny cells that you see on solar panels.  Read more about it [here](https://www.planete-energies.com/en/medias/close/how-does-photovoltaic-cell-work)

On average, a solar panel uses about 20 grams of silver.

&amp;#x200B;

[China needs silver but can't get it](https://preview.redd.it/mx8ng1mppgf61.png?width=1328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e28b940133f96c3c4934fbe3490cf557117ac5ec)

*Silver supply is dropping*

Silver prices crashed after it peaked in 2011. As silver dropped 72.1%, silver miners had to find ways to cut costs to keep turning profit. What they did was they dramatically decreased the amount of exploration and development for silver mines. As such, Silver production is in decline.

&amp;#x200B;

[Chart for you](https://preview.redd.it/jd7j4f5tpgf61.png?width=1314&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bf89b396074924c03685e65bcb4ae1556f7c90e)

&amp;#x200B;

So to conclude the boomer DD:

\- Inflation is on the rise

\- Too much money is being printed

\- Silver outperforms gold

\- Silver biggest use is industrial use

\- Silver demand is increasing

\- Silver supply is dropping

**WSB DD **

&amp;#x200B;

According to [coingape.com](https://coingape.com) , in order to pull short squeeze of hedge funds (not necessarily JP Morgan), we would need silver to go to $500

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Some tweet they put on their site idk ](https://preview.redd.it/6dej6iowpgf61.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e33a578db6f235c5e14b7d420637ce7936838b6d)

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, I am in no way saying that we should short squeeze silver ( Hello SEC! )

I'm just saying that I really like SLV stock, and you should consider it for the above boomer reasons. There is also an additional upside of the fact that IF for some reason many people bought the stock it would squeeze upwards infinitely. This is because unlike the GME short squeeze, where GME can issue new stock, a silver short squeeze could continue until they manage to mine more silver, because silver cannot be printed.

Also, we saw a lot of hedge funds trying to interfere with the GME short squeeze. Robinhood restricting bought GME shares, brokers being gay etc etc. The difference with silver is brokers do not control how much silver we can buy, and all the new people who just joined WSB in the daily discussion thread going "Hey guys i'm a newbie can someone please tell me whether stocks are going up or down today and also how can I buy stock also which stock is going up the most today thank you" can also join in. If a short squeeze were to happen, this is how it would happen.

1. People buy SLV stock (not random ETF's because they don't buy physical silver)
2. Silver price go up
3. JP Morgan ANGRY
4. Robinhood and other brokers experience "temporary outages", "Buy button glitch where buy button disappears for some reason" , "Limiting SLV shares that can be bought"
5. WSB and noobs who don't know how to buy stock can just go outside and buy physical silver bars or coins. Or since we are in a pandemic order it off eBay or something

Basically, the special thing about silver is that more cannot be printed and that buying it cant be restricted in any meaningful way.

Whether or not large banks like JP Morgan are actually short silver is a different discussion that other people should write about because it's heavily debated and I don't know the answer, but what we can CONFIRM is that HEDGE FUNDS are short on silver.

Maybe in the future first place will get a silver medal and second place will get gold

&amp;#x200B;

**Rebuttals against the bullish case on silver**

I have been drafting this message for a while, and at the same time have skimmed a few anti-silver posts. The common points against this is

\- One contract is too expensive

\- People who don't know how to trade futures will get stuck with it

\- Its taking attention away from GME

&amp;#x200B;

*One contract is too expensive*

The contracts you are referring to are the futures, aka paper silver. There are three ways to buy physical silver

1. But silver futures and take delivery
2. Buy SLV shares
3. Buy Silver from jewellers or online sellers

There are currently around 5 times more contracts for silver in the COMEX markets than there is supply of it. This means that when you buy SLV futures and exercise it, the person who sold it to you would have to scramble to find someone who DOES have it. Once we do this, they will start to realise and register to complete lack of silver there is in the market. Companies like TSLA, Samsung and Canadian solar have been accumulating a silver stockpile, because they know that supply is dwindling. People have bought all the reasonably priced silver online too, if you don't believe me check for yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

*People who don't know how to trade futures will get stuck with tonnes of silver and delivery fees*

See above

&amp;#x200B;

*Its taking attention away from GME*

I am not being paid by anyone to write this, i just genuinely see the potential for it. While I do agree that GME is still relevant, it doesn't mean we cannot have other stocks in our portfolios. We shouldn't miss out on silver just because we are still in GME. Besides, a SLV squeeze would be much more beneficial than the GME squeeze because of my last point below.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Last and most important point - the benefit of a silver price rise**

**When GME prices go up, who benefits? Shareholders, hedge funds who are long GME, banks, etc**

**When BITCOIN moons, who benefits? Banks, rich people, people who have the education and means to figure out how to buy it, people who have access to bitcoin wallets, brokers etc.**

**When we blow up stocks like GME and BTC, even though we profit, and even if we bankrupt hedge funds, the money goes to other hedge funds or rich people who can afford the risk to own GME stock.**

&amp;#x200B;

**BUT WHO OWNS SILVER?**

Almost every household owns some silver. Whether its' bars, coins, or religious statues. Poorer countries and places, like Asia and Africa, most households have a small silver chain, a family heirloom, ornamental utensils or ornamental gourd bucket I don't know.

If silver prices moon, money goes to the people, even though yes some will go to rich people who are long on silver, silver is something that poor people are also shareholders of. If we can get silver back to its FAIR VALUE, through the reasons and HYPOTHETICAL methods I mentioned above, we can not only burn hedge funds, profit for ourselves, but also help poor families.

Poor people don't how to set up a brokerage account and buy Gamestonk. Poor people don't know how to trade cryptocurrencies. Poor people don't have the capital to enter into the stock market. What they DO have is gold and silver (mainly silver).  When they don't have the knowledge or ability to buy shares (As proven with the recent influx of people with "What is a broker" kind of questions), they get left out of these massive wealth transfers. Its much easier to say "Buy silver lol" than "Ok so open a brokerage account with a broker that does not block meme stocks and that suits your needs, verify all your information, deposit money and make sure the risk you take aligns with your risk tolerance and the amount you are willing to lose...."

If you want to bankrupt hedge funds, don't transfer wealth from one hedge fund to other hedge funds who are long GME. Instead, transfer wealth from the hedge funds to the pockets of poor families.

TLDR WSB DD: If silver goes back to its fair value then lots of poorer people will benefit from this along with you. Also silver buying cannot be restricted because you don't need a broker to buy silver. (IF YOU ARE READING THIS DITCH ROBINHOOD AND CHANGE BROKERS. IF YOU DON'T CHANGE BROKRS THEY WILL KEEP DOING THINGS LIKE THIS \[When you don't pay for a product you ARE the product\])

Regardless or whether or not we take part, silver will get to its fair value. Although it would be faster if we joined.

Title: Lets Get Real Here
Were all retards, but were self-aware retards. We make our own decisions because A is A, B is B and GME is . 

Just because someone hypes up a stock doesnt mean that you should invest. Its always up to **YOU** and the amount of time youre willing to spend **RESEARCHING** the stock. I know thats not what WSB initially stood for, most of us just came here for the loss / gain porn. But now that the attention of SEC, media and hedge funds has been drawn onto us, its important to differentiate hype and rational, critical thinking. 

None of us here buys stocks because **SOMEONE** tells us to do so. We make our own fucking choices and we accept the losses and welcome the gains. 

Regarding the current situation: based on informative posts and comments Ive had the pleasure of reading, it looks like its going to be a long and weary battle. But at the end of the day, what differentiates you from a paper handed bitch and a legitimate retard, are the reasons behind your investing decisions. 

***Do you really believe that GME is an undervalued company (in general)? Do you believe that GME has the potential to expand into something truly beautiful and magnificent, especially after all the traction the companys been having over the course of last month? Do you trust the company?*** 

If you do, then youve got nothing to worry about - even if the stock price dips to $50-60. Investings never about making a quick buck, sure there are those who get lucky every now and then, but if you invest with the I make quick gains mindset, chances are youll lose. Because youre investing in a highly volatile, unpredictable market that has a history of crashing at the slightest of inconveniences. 

TDLR; invest in shit you actually believe in. 

AND HOLD

Title: Low-quality DD with thoughts about situation, future, exit and my impression of the whole "war"
This text will be emoji free, I won't tell everyone to hold to moon and shit, even though this might be the way... or not.

&amp;#x200B;

# I. current Situation

As all people here obviously noted, there is a war going on between hedge funds, retail investors and other people in the background including media, reddit, celebrities.

Everyone has their play, everyone wants money, fame, leverage, whatever.

There is a split here in reddit, some just want gainz, some want to keep the "movement" going, and some kinda want both.

&amp;#x200B;

**FYI I'm neither.** I'm not invested in GME or anything else, as a matter of fact, I'm a stock virgin. I'm a pretty high earning, not 1% high, but I get a fucking good salary for my age and this will only rise. So I'm not in financial danger in any way, but I have close relationship to my money in terms of not losing it.

I wanted to buy GME, but at any given point except last wednesday I was looking at dangerous numbers either too volatile for me to get in or going down.

&amp;#x200B;

# II. what we REALLY know

We know: hedge funds shorted GME and others. We dont know from where exactly, we dont know exactly when, and as a matter of fact, we dont know how much. ALL the data we have is either outdated, not a good source or just flat wrong. SI might sit at 200% right now, that would tell us nothing. Those could be shorts started at 300 and hedges want to earn even more, those could be shorts started at 20, 90 or 180$.

&amp;#x200B;

At this moment, **even SI is not helping us making decision**s, even if we would know the true number.

We know the stock is very **volatile** right now, we dont really know why. Short ladder attacks are a myth, I hope this is cleared by now.

&amp;#x200B;

What is **obvious**, is that there is market "**manipulation**". Manipulation derives from latin "manus", meaning by hand. That is for sure. We know hedge funds and even us change the stock price by hand somehow. If it is by buying, holding, selling, shorting, fake news, true news, whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

# III. What does that all mean now

It means, the short squeeze could already be over, it could mean we are in it, but it was heavily fought against by any means including unfair ones. It could mean squeeze is still in the future waiting.

&amp;#x200B;

What it means for the stock: It will stay volatile. It might stay at 90$ for some time, as long as retailes still buy in, and maybe even other hedge funds or whales. It might drop, it might even rise, **maybe hedge funds bought in right now and want to keep the momentum upward and sell at a specific point, crushing the price with retailers beeing the bagholders.**

What does it mean for us retailers?

Its dangerous to invest into this stock. Nothing is safe, diamond handing this could end in GME dropping to 20$ again and this might stay the case for a long time. It might work and stock price goes into 1000$.

&amp;#x200B;

# IV. Whom are we fighting?

It is important to note, that we are fighting a multibillion dollar cartel of people who are deep into the stockmarket since beginning of stock trading. Basically, they know every trick and more. Do you guys really think, they have no idea how to fight retailers? They might do "ladder attacks" because they shorted the stock again and now stop, just to buy into GME? They might want us all to hold just so the price rises until EXACTLY 299$ when they will sell 10mm shares and price drops to 90$ again.

They might want to ride the rocket to the moon, too. They might want the whole stock to drop to 10$, who knows.

&amp;#x200B;

It is important to know, that they analyse this whole sitation and make their own plan.

&amp;#x200B;

# V. What is the danger here?

&amp;#x200B;

This is a reddit. We are 8,5mm degenerates on this sub and latest after last week hedge funds are monitoring this. So what is the problem? If reddit is monitored, they might even use this, for example, **they know a ton of people will cling to this stock with their life, not even thinking about selling if it is 98% down**. I have no fucking clue what a good trader could do with this info, but I'm betting it is dangerous for the people on here invested in GME.

&amp;#x200B;

# VI. What shall we do, what is the future?

&amp;#x200B;

I have no fucking clue. Personally, if I already had invested in GME, there would be 2 possible situations:

I got in below todays market price. For example like all those guys with 10k shares at 20$. They are still hugely in the green. I personally would propably have secured some cash at 400$, but I would definitly secure some cash now, depending how much I'm in. I would keep at least a good portion of the stock in hopes in goes moon.

&amp;#x200B;

If I got in above todays market price, let's say at 150, I would think about getting out anytime the stocks goes above 100$ again and try to minimise my loss, IF the money is a lot for me or I need it.

&amp;#x200B;

If it is gamble money, I would stay invested, but would be pessimistic enough to not hope for rocketfuel.

# VII. What if the rocket goes moon, when do I sell

A false impression that was created here is that everyone, at any point buying into GME would make tons of tendies. That is WRONG. Usually, in situations like this, early adopters make tons of tendies (DFV for example or anyone who got in at 20$ dollar range). Then at some point, let's say stock price hits 1000$. Now what happens if everyone and their mother sells at exactly that point? First 10000 sellers get their 1000$ price. But pretty fast, price drops immensly. This will end in a downward spiral (see VW short squeeze graph). With tons of people not making huge bank or even lose money, IF they got in late. (think 300$ range and sell the last)

&amp;#x200B;

So what could be an exit strat be?

**I would say, the later you got in, the earlier you sell.**

That makes sure you exit in the GREEN, and not accidentally in the red. I wont sell at 350 if I got in at 300. But I wouldnt wait out a mass selloff and then might drop under 200$ and still lose money after I tripled my money.

&amp;#x200B;

**Last words from a stock virgin and TLDR:** This whole story is crazy and cool, and **I hope all of ya earn tons of tendies**. But PLS for the love of god, IF stock raises again and you see overall black numbers, and this is your fucking **retirement money**, GET IT FUCKING BACK and cash out. This is not a game.

This whole dream of becoming a rich tendie ape is not worth beeing homeless because stocks treat retailers like bitches. This whole thing might work out. But you're against a multibillion dollar cartel that does EVERYTHING to make money or keep money. They shit on every rule, just to stay on top. Dont risk your life's savings on the hunch they might play by the book.

Title: I figured out what is going on with GME, listen
Okay fellow retards, i am either going full retard or full Michael Burry right now.

While my girlfriend was out with her boyfriend and i was playing with my Lego, i figured out what is going on, i am gonna make it very simple, because my brain does not allow me to make complex thoughts, so here goes.

First, we know that Melvin cuckital and other Hedge bros shorted heavily GME, the SI was 200069% and the strike should be fairly low, which leads to a short squeeze, now at this point the losses they were looking at was at the Billions or more ( that's a lot of money, in case you dont understand). A lot of apes here think that they are trying to floor the stock so they can cover their asses and not pay out, but here is the catch, THEY DON'T.

If HFs have so much power to destroy a stock while the price and volume is so fucking high combined with the fact that they can do this while the world is looking at them, then they would be Gazillionaires by now. If a HFs can create so much swing in a stock like GME, then what prohibits them from doing so in a smaller stock with much lower volume and make a shit ton of money all the time, the SEC ??? Fucking lmao if you thought that

My point here is, that we are overestimating their powers and i am going to explain why.

We got the news that shorts covered their positions, which everyone thought was BS, but i believe they actually did, and here is how.

We know that Melvin got around 50 Bn capital a few days ago, so how did they persuade investors to give them money??? Did they tell them they will try to manipulate the stock and bet that people will sell off, do you think rich people heard that and said "Oh yeah, great idea, lets bet 50bn that retarded apes will panic and sell off", fuck no, they proposed a real plan, that would not bet on us doing sane things and i am gonna tell you their plan and why it makes sense.

They know that GME is a ticking bomb, they know that people want GME to MOON, so they hedged their bets by manipulating the stock to drop at 80-90, possibly lower and buy a fuck ton of calls to hedge their retarded bet.
They feed the MSM with BS, manipulate the market, so the price drops, then they buy a fuck ton of calls/shares so they will limit their losses or even make more money. S3 partners, media, RH have started acting like our friends now, isnt this a bit suspicious??? It is, because they now want the stock to fucking rocket, so their friends can get their money back.

So what happened is, Melvin got money to buy calls, fed media BS to drop the price and buy calls at good prices, now the media,S3 and RH are with us, the stock will rocket and they will hedge their bets and cover their asses, it all makes sense.

Edit: I am kinda retarded and dont know how to use symbols so more people can understand, sorry
Edit 2: I am not a financial advisor, i dont know how the market works, this is not any kind of advice. I have bought 42069 shares of $SUGMA for SEC

TL:DR; Stock will go MOOON MOOON SOON

Title: Anyone referring to a hedge fund as a "hedgie" is either a bot or is under 12 years old.
This term did not exist a month ago, when we were retarded but not stupid.

That is all.

Title: Lets Look at GME from a NON-BIAS standpoint
**THIS IS NOT FINANICAL ADVICE I AM NOT A PROFFESIONAL SO PLEASE DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH AS WELL.**

***I will simplify this very easily so new retards can understand this simply.***

1. Short Interest: ***This is ultimately why we got in***. **I don't care if you like the stock or not. We all want money at the end of the day, and that's the truth.** We really want those who shorted the shares to finally buyback the shares. The interest rate did drop from 140 to 120. This was a guarantee on the robinhood fiasco day. **That was only 20%**. And we got the confirmation from multiple sources. I am using highshortinterest.com which I do understand is not updated as frequently but it did update on that day. It comes as a huge surprise to me that 120 dropped to 51%. Either they bought it from other hedge funds at a background deal, or the day Robinhood manipulated the prices down, that rise up was the shorts selling. Thus we got back to 300ish from the low of 110. In this case, it has squeezed. **In the case it hasn't, the shorts are actually screwed if we just hold (we need a short interest update with actual legitimate facts, I do not know where to get this information besides the website stated. Do not listen to S3 partners, as they have gone back and forth with bs. Its an estimate)**

&amp;#x200B;

2) **GME &amp; AMC are following the exact same pattern**. This is a huge sign of manipulation. Although that shouldnt come as a surprise. When Robinhood let traders sell, shorts were able to cover for cheap as fuck. **THEY COMPLETELY SCREWED THE MOMENTUM, HOWEVER THIS CAN EASILY CHANGE, AS THERE ARE MORE BUYERS THEN SELLERS.**

3) **Silver diversion**: Let me just say this. GME AND AMC are basically the same situation but different Short interest. **If they wanted to divert from GME, they should of said we moved to AMC. But no they specifically mentioned silver. That is a huge sign, and this cannot be understated more that they want to close the movement.** You really need to think about how the news is reflecting this, and how it still continues to reflect it.

4)  GME is still testing grounds: GME is actually hovering 80-100. Like actually??? How is this even possible. We are still in the squeeze.  **If it crashed we would actually be at 40 right now.**

5) Short Ladder attacks: I was super hesitant to believe this shit. There's no actual sources, but we do have crammer in a video saying what hedge funds do in desperate circumstances.  The legimatacy of short ladder attacks is comparable to the following: This is basically like saying the assassination of Kennedy was not an actual hit, and when cocaine was brought into America, we just didn't have the resources to stop it from coming.

**I AM GOING TO BE HONEST, people definitely paper handed at this short ladder attack**. **This would actually bring their short interest down a bit, while keeping the stock price at a safe level.**

&amp;#x200B;

6) **People are on our side. Listen carefully. We can actually win. I was retarded and thought this was going to be easy.** Of course it wasn't gonna be. Did you know why the Volkswagen short squeeze happened? Because one smart dude decided to hold and not sell, forcing high interest rates and shorts getting margin called. This is inevitable if we drive the price back up, they will be forced to buyback the shares.  **WE ALSO HAVE THAT ONE DIAMOND BALLS FCKER&gt; DFV.**

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: HOLD 

&amp;#x200B;

Title: GME is Still Extremely Undervalued. Here are the Real Reasons Why
[deleted]

Title: $SLV is not going to get squeezed...$SLV is the Trojan Horse for the squeeze THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING
I have no horse in the GME "fight" right now.  I wish you all the best, and it is the biggest trading mistake of my life so far.  I was talking about GME with my friends in March 2020, and even did trade some options then for a loss.  I must have read DFV at some point, as we were discussing Burry and a "technical short squeeze" happening.  But I missed the real boat, so good on DFV and all of the rest of you degenerates.  

Instead, I focused my market attention during quarantine on precious metals.  My opinion is that in the long term (10+ years) they will provide the only real hedge against inflation in the world as every CB on the planet is exploding the supply of fiat to deal with COVID economic disruption.  

In the short term, I believe that the "powers that be" are engineering the largest short squeeze in the history of markets.  We do not have the power to effect whether this happens, it is simply an inevitability.  HFs, banks, and other large institutions are going to extract an enormous amount of wealth from the world during this squeeze.  This money will be taken from the future pocket of every consumer of industrial goods for the next several decades in the form of inflated prices on everything: batteries, electronics, solar panels, EVs...even jewelry and silverware.  

We cannot stop them, but I have decided to try to hop on for the ride.  The last few months aside, I never saw WSB as a force for societal change, because the people who control the money are always going to win the most in the end.  WSB is a place where we can learn the tricks of a market that is structurally rigged against us, and use those tricks to our advantage.  To use an analogy that I think we all know: I am not, and will never be, Ender.  But I can learn that the Enemy's Gate is Down, and play The Game that way.


**The tl;dr is this: the market for silver is the most manipulated physical market in the history of the world.  $SLV is the vehicle that is currently being used behind the scenes to vaccum up ownership of every available physical bar of silver in major bullion vaults in the world.  When it has completed doing that, the "paper" markets that have held down the price of silver for decades will become disconnected from the physical markets.  The energy that has been artificially held back for decades by this paper will explode the price of physical silver, and I have no idea how high it will go.  $SLV will stand (mostly) alone as the world's exchange traded product for electronic trading of physical silver.**



# LET'S START AT THE BEGINNING: WHY IS SILVER IMPORTANT?

Silver has been used as real currency for thousands of years, and there is an argument to be made for returning to "sound" money through the use of silver and gold.  However, that is not the argument that I am making.

Silver is a highly industrial metal, and it's usage for industry will only continue to expand as we electrify the future.  Silver is important for electrical applications b/c it is the most-conductive / least-resistive metal in the universe (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity#Resistivity_and_conductivity_of_various_materials).  It is used heavily in all electronic applications (even more since RoHS has pushed us away from Tin/Lead and towards Tin/Silver solder blends, with silver being added to mitigate the longevity problems of 100% Tin solder growing Tin whiskers and shorting out components).  But the largest new demands on silver are going to come from solar panels and EVs.  Utility-scale solar is now virtually tied with wind as the cheapest new sources of energy in the world and is only getting cheaper every year.  As fossil fuel plants continue to reach the end of their service life, they are going to be replaced with solar and wind technologies.  As EVs become more prevalent, their components (ESPECIALLY their batteries) will produce additional demand for Silver.

As smart investors are wont to do, this coming demand for industrial silver has been front-run and large quantites of silver have been sucked into investment products so that they can produce financial returns when demand begins to increase.  2020 showed remarkable investor interest in silver, to the tune of an estimated 350Mtoz moving into exchange traded products like $SLV.  $SLV alone added ~200Mtoz of silver to it's holdings in 2020.

Unfortunately for the market, supply cannot meet demand: Of the 930.9Mtoz estimated for 2020 demand, only 236Mtoz was available for physical investment, because the rest was consumed by industrial uses.  This means that $SLV alone absorbed almost the entire world's capacity for silver investment in 2020, and as you'll see soon, this is only accelerating in 2021.

# LETS GET PHYSICAL, PHYSICAL

Now it's important to understand that huge amounts of "silver" is traded on "paper" markets, and these markets have historically decided the approximate cost of physical silver in the world, in the form of the "spot price".  I'm not going to give anyone a primer on how this works, go read about the London Fix and COMEX paper on your own time.  But the important thing to know is that there are a bunch of silver bars in vaults in London and in the U.S., and electronic claims on them are traded on the LBMA and COMEX continuously, without the silver ever leaving the vaults.  

However, these vaults have concrete numbers of physical bars in them, and trading contracts against them technically means that you can show up at a window somewhere and demand your 5x 1000oz bars that a COMEX warrant entitle you to.  This redemption happens all the time, and it can be used to extract physical silver from the unallocated storage at bullion vaults and release it to industrial or consumer bullion uses.  However, these bars can also be moved into "registered" or "allocated" accounts without them leaving the overall vault storage.  This means that a quantity of individual silver bars that an owner holds title to can be physically moved inside the vault onto a different rack, and the owner has individual serial numbers of bars that they own.  These bars can be withdrawn on demand only by their owner and are not available for general redemption of a COMEX warrant.

So how many bars are there? Well between LBMA and COMEX, there are 1480.3Mtoz sitting in vaults (sources below when I start doing math).  This includes all allocated AND unallocated bars.  Now, obviously London and NY are separated by an ocean, but people always like to bring up that bars could be moved b/w London &lt;-&gt; American COMEX vaults.  This is an enormous undertaking, but let's make a "spherical chicken in a vaccuum" level assumption and say that LBMA + COMEX vaults are a singular source of inventory for both $SLV and other market participants.

If you read the $SLV S-1 (which I did: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1330568/000119312505127244/ds1.htm) you would learn that the custodian of the $SLV trust is required to hold all silver weight (with an exception for 1100toz of unallocated, lol) that is owned by the trust in allocated accounts, where the individual bars are physically segregated inside the vaults, and the serial numbers of the owned bars are explicitly recorded.  The idea that there is "no physical silver" backing the SLV trust and "you could get settled with cash" is _ridiculous_.  iShares publishes a report listing every serial number of every bar that is owned by the trust, along with the total weight contained in the bars.  It is 10847 pages long (you can read it here if you have trouble sleeping at night: https://emea-markets.jpmorgan.com/metalicsWebAppJanus/publicUnauthenticated/BONY_SLV.pdf) and is updated frequently.

The underlying silver is _owned_ by the trust.  It cannot be removed from the trust unless "baskets" of 50000 shares are redeemed by an "Authorized Participant" which is only a few large brokers.  It cannot be removed by the bullion vaults and given to other customers because it is physically segregated inside the vaults.

People who have recently beaten down the idea of a silver squeeze love to talk about how JP Morgan is the custodian for the SLV trust.  And because JPM just paid a $1B fine for historical manipulation of the paper silver market, they aren't going to be honest about this.  This is crazy talk.

When it comes to the dishonesty of a big bank, there is "fraud" and there is FRAUD.  "Fraud" would be them saying "Oh sorry, we didn't realize that a laundromat bringing in $300k/week of dirty dollar bills was out of the ordinary". "Fraud" happens all the time, and the banks get away with it regularly.  FRAUD would be them saying "Oh yes, 3rd party customer (iShares) who services dozens of other large banking institutions in the world, here is objective evidence, with serial numbers, that we have these silver bars in the vault" and then just making up the data.  It is QANON-level crazy, IMHO, to think that JPM is going to commit FRAUD by publishing a list of serial numbers that is completely fake.  

I believe the exact opposite: since they _have_ just gotten caught, they are playing it straight this time and have just switched sides in order to go long.  On the COMEX alone, JP Morgan Chase is long 193.9Mtoz, or just north of $5B.

(COMEX depository data by weight: https://www.cmegroup.com/delivery_reports/Silver_stocks.xls)

The problem for the futures and options markets is that their continual trading of paper contracts is chasing a smaller and smaller amount of physical silver that is not owned by $SLV.  And the market participants (minus, now, JPM) who have gotten away with naked selling of paper contracts and mostly settling them for cash are going to soon find the underlying vaults empty and no metal to give to warrant holders who come looking for it.



# HOW BIG OF A PROBLEM IS $SLV FOR THE NAKED SHORTS IN THE PAPER MARKET? LET'S DO SOME MATH.

$SLV inventory math:

$SLV is holding 669,357,789.40 troy ounces in trust, and has 720,500,000 shares outstanding.  

(If you are curious why $SLV/share trades below the spot price, it's because: 669.4Mtoz / 720.5M shares = .929 toz / share)

($SLV data from here: https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239855/ishares-silver-trust-fund?qt=SLV#/ )

(screenshot from tonight for posterity: https://imgur.com/a/0sqcMFr)


Bullion vault inventory math:

London (LBMA) silver stocks are 1080.5Mtoz (http://www.lbma.org.uk/london-precious-metals-physical-holdings-statistics)

US COMEX silver stocks are 399.8Mtoz (https://www.cmegroup.com/delivery_reports/Silver_stocks.xls)

669.4/(1080.5 + 399.8) = 45.2% of the vaulted silver in the world is already owned by SLV

Subtracting what SLV already owns, leaves us with: (1080.5 + 399.8) - 669.4 = 810.9Mtoz

(This is _completely_ ignoring the fact that a lot of that remaining silver is owned in registered or allocated accounts by individual owners.  E.g. there is 150.2Mtoz in "registered" on the COMEX which means those bars are already specifically deeded to an individual owner. But they could theoretically sell it to SLV so I included it as available.)

810.9Mtoz is the ABSOLUTE THEORETICAL MAXIMUM available in LBMA + COMEX silver that is not _already_ owned by SLV.


Now how short are the shorts?  Some more math:

OI on COMEX futures: https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/precious/silver-futures-and-options.html

    + 179786*5000toz
    + 130402*5000toz 
    +   8245*1000toz
    +   1903*2500toz
    ----------------
    1,563,942,500 = 1563.9Mtoz 
in currently open interest that could be demanded for delivery.  Just on the COMEX, there could be demand for twice as much silver as there is in the combined LBMA + COMEX vaults that is not explicitly owned by $SLV right now.  

Caveats: 

- I have not included any London futures contracts that may have claims on metal here.  I am not versed in their contracts at all and don't have a good data source right now.  If anyone knows how to calculate the short obligation for London I would be glad to add it.

- I have not analyzed any of the strike prices on COMEX options or dates on COMEX futures...some of them could be way out of the money or way in the future.  Many silver producers sell futures years in advance to lock in prices, and then deliver the physical to satisfy the contracts.

Using the same basic methodologytotal shorts divided by shares [toz in this case] outstandingas is used on a stock to calculate short interest (and gave us the infamous 140% short interest on GME) we get......drumroll please:

1563.9 short / 810.9 physical = 192.9% short interest.

**OPEN INTEREST ON COMEX SILVER FUTURES AND OPTIONS IS EQUIVALENT TO A 192.9% SHORT INTEREST AGAINST ALL LONDON AND U.S. AVAILABLE INVENTORY.**  

But it gets even worse.





# WANNA ADD A GAMMA SQUEEZE??

I pulled the data for all current OI in SLV options.  There is a large number (5.7 million) of call contracts open (here are the totals: https://imgur.com/tiqPA34)

Using the .929toz/share number, we can calculate that there are up to 527.2Mtoz that would have to be bought during an absolute runaway Gamma Squeeze.  Call options on $SLV max out right now at $55, so the spot price would only have to increase by around 122% to reach the point that all of that weight would need to have been purchased.  But at some point, it could become self-reinforcing, and the gamma squeeze continues to cause more gamma squeezing.  

I believe that this almost happened Sunday evening (2021-01-31) as evidenced by the huge premium that $SLV was trading to the futures price for a few minutes when trading opened.  (My comparison chart: https://i.imgur.com/UPjL3zm.png) 

The Silver ETF that trades on Sunday in Tel Aviv (https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TCHF82:IT) closed up &gt;6% (and was consistenly rising for the entire session) before any american spot markets opened.  I believe that hedging algorithms at MM firms that write options saw this spike as a need to buy shares in $SLV to cover their deltas, and so they bought the opening of $SLV like crazy.  $SLV opened up 17.6%, while paper only opened up about 6%.  Paper market players had to sell 23.8Mtoz of paper in the first minute of trading to keep the price under control.  I have never seen an imbalance like this before, and it was covered up quickly (within 2 hours of trading).  But to me, it sounds like Vincent's heartbeat monitor in GATTACA when he runs out of fake signal: there was a cover up required to hide this explosion.

When the day comes that this cover up is not executed properly, stuff is going to get ugly, b/c $SLV won't just gamma squeeze like a normal stock...



# BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! A TRADITIONAL GAMMA/SHORT SQUEEZE WILL SEEM LIKE NOTHING IN SILVER

The squeeze in silver will be FAR WORSE than the combination of a gamma and short squeeze in a stock, because shares of stock cannot be removed from the market.  Eventually somebody holding $VW or $GME is going to say "sure, I'll sell at $42,000.69 per share" and that share can go back to cover a short.  But if instead of doing that, the holder of that share withdrew it from the market by converting it to a physical token b/c they thought that the physical token would be more valuable than the share (the retail premium on physical silver vs. paper silver), the short interest would INCREASE as shares were converted into tokens.  And since there are currently more "shares" of silver than there are bars of silver in the vault, the shorts can be caught with a literally illiquid market that has nothing to buy.

Zero.  Zilch.  No silver available.

The doomsday scenario (for paper silver holders and writers) is the following combination:

- holders of COMEX warrants will see the rising premium of physical bullion to the spot price and decide to redeem their warrants for physical 

- a rising spot price will Gamma Squeeze the writers of $SLV options into buying more shares in a runaway fashion and the trust will absorb all available vault inventory as it issues new shares

COMEX warrant holders who try to demand metal that doesn't exist will literally break the market.  

The CBOE will probably step in and decide to force settle the contracts for cash at the last known good price, and **COMEX paper warrants will cease trading forever.**

The physical market price will then be disconnected from the paper market, and $SLV as an exchange traded product will stand (mostly) alone as the new "paper" market for silver.




# SO WTF DO I DO? [NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE]

Well I could always buy physical silver, if I can stomach the premium and wait 8 weeks for it to show up.  Or, I could just get long on $SLV.  Since I believe that $SLV will stand alone after the dust settles as the one true claim on bars in the vaults, I could be long the actual $SLV ticker in several ways:

- Buying shares (duh, but it worked for $GME)

- Buying long dated calls (Gamma Squeeze go BRRRRR, but who knows when)

- Buying option spreads (my personal favorite)

If I wanted to maximize my contribution to the Gamma Squeeze, I'd probably buy as much Delta/$ as I could get using weeklies, which would be 2/5 $26.5C or 2/12 $28C 

(Max delta/$ calculations: https://i.imgur.com/Az3o85v.png and https://i.imgur.com/eRPQo6k.png)

Current open positions for me are: (https://imgur.com/vWZrziG)

- Jan'22 50/55 call spread (costs .17, moonshot pays $5, 29x)

- 4/16 40/55 call spread (costs .18, moonshot pays $15, 83x)

- 2/5 $26.5 call (to maximize delta/$)

- jan'22 $40 call (to minimize risk of missing the big one)

- $AG shares and jan'23 10/35 call spread (added, sorry i forgot this one: https://imgur.com/fz80V6J)

Title: GME Speculation: price may drop to the $60-30 range before the squeeze is squoze
I'm retarded so don't take this as financial advice but based on the current GME pattern looks like we'll see a small spike during the Thursday premarket and it'll then drop into the $60-30 range by the end of the day. On Friday the pattern will tighten up and we'll likely see either $GME fall to oblivion or a big ass spike by Monday. IDK if the spike will be the squeeze, but It'll be big. The number of [Puts expiring and past volume](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbavu0/the_ratio_of_short_volume_to_total_volume/) supports this theory and [Robinhood increased allowed share purchases to $500](https://www.forexlive.com/news/!/robinhood-increases-limits-in-buying-gme-to-500-shares-20210204) which should make it possible for more apes to buy the dip and drive the squeeze.

Recap. 

Melvin/hedge funds short GameStop. Twice. 

Xbox/Microsoft GM becomes acting GME CEO- 

Chewy founder CEO buys in/submits prospectus to Board regarding GME transformation Microsoft/GameStop collaboration is announced

 *it was held back that they get revenue from partnership with Xbox game pass* 

Now-we also have Elon and Mark weighing 
 in with expert advice (hey-Im not a millionaire so they know more than me) 

And add in the market crashing, silver spambots, margins canceled, social media shut downs and all of a sudden limit buying in shares the day after all time highs. 

Very. Suspicious. To say the least. 

next?  

We know whats next. 

GME magically recovers as the darling of Wall Street while we got manipulated again. 

But. The story takes a turn. Billboards start appearing across the country. Melvin cant take a drive to the local Wendys anymore without seeing GME to the moon. Finland buys in. Saudia Arabia buys in. Japan buys in. The mother f@cking Times Square has GME to the moon lit up for the world to see. 

This is uncharted territory here folks. I know what Wall Street wants to happen. The media is pumping it right now. They have DFV in their beady sights. They want to see us fall. Again. 
But. Its a new world. 2008 and the VW short squeeze didnt have Twitter. 2008 didnt have an army of the working class sitting at their computers figuring out that Wall Street is not the God like money figure we have been told to be believe. The reality is that the Hedge Funds that protect peoples retirement are really just going off of insider knowledge and the ability to manipulate the market in mass. 

Its not 2008 anymore. I think the world has it right and they see that WSB/DFV made a damn wise call. They are the ones trying to hold the share price up every day facing down the hedge funds with sheer determination to be validated and paid. 

What they have attempted to do is criminal. Its not 2008. 
The world is legitimately watching and showing support in this in a way I dont think anybody expected. Especially in 2021. 

Im holding. I dont want to. This isnt an example of my normal trading-having every single trick used against you.. to the point that its simply pure lunacy that we are witnessing.

To actually want to question a member of WSB for market manipulation. Seriously.

I cannot in good faith sell and leave everyone standing alone trying to do the right thing. Ive already lost the money. 
My retail money did the DD. They just cheated.

Adding-I am a simple monkey and do not give stock advice.

FIRST AND FOREMOST: YES I LIKE GME$, DOUBLED MY POSITION YESTERDAY ON DIP

"Prospect Capital Corporation is a leading publicly-traded Business Development Company (BDC). We make debt and equity investments in U.S. middle market businesses across a range of industries, and seek to deliver steady, attractive returns to our shareholders"

So basically they give business loans

So if it out performs earnings it could have a major spike. Following its better than expected earnings in 5/11/2020, the stock price ran up nearly 100% over the next 30 days.

Title: Completely neutral take on $GME
Okay okay okay, Jesus Christ you guys are like 5 year old siblings in the back of a 1999 Toyota Tacoma throwing blind punches while crammed in a 3 foot tiny square seat behind your dad's back titties.

Had to get that off my chest.

The animosity between bulls and bears on $GME lately is absolutely ridiculous. **BEARS**: It's not "how this sub always was" to completely shit on people for holding a position. Let them do whatever the fuck they want and anticipate the loss porn for breakfast the next day if you're so sure they're screwed. As long as you're ONLY dealing with money you have to lose, and not liquidating your ROTH to play a gamble, then you have every right to be here and invest like anybody else.

**BULLS**: However, the number of people saying it'll still go to the moon and downvoting every opposite opinion they see is a huge issue. They know that this event will likely stay on people's minds *for years to come* \- especially with the different studios trying to capitalize on the situation and sentiments real time - but that does not mean much for the longevity of your play. Already this week we see that we're at a point where we can exhaust the capital from the people willing to invest and lose all of our money in the process.

I'm personally **bullish GME, 69 $GME@98**, and it sucked to see the whole squeeze kinda fizzle out and into what it is now. Even though I'm anal about it, I'm **\*not using emotions to dictate my investment\***. I truly believe in the value of Gamestop under Cohen and the new VPs they signed on today, and a tiny little part of me is still invested in the idea of a potential squeeze in the next few years that I'm still not selling.

Truly, we \*won't know for sure\* whether there's the potential for another squeeze, short or gamma, [until those numbers come out from the FINRA this next Tuesday the 9th](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest). I've heard some say that it got delayed to the 15th but I haven't been able to find the source on this myself. Since the opinions on this are so binary, there will be \***\*no way of knowing whether this is all conspiracy or not\*\*** until we have some guaranteed bonafide proof that the shorts **\*\*ARE OR ARE NOT\*\*** in.

Until this point,  it is baseless to make a case about whether the squeeze is still on or not. Even the slightest confirmation towards the squeeze case will likely induce another gamma squeeze, since attention will be redirected toward a short-term high growth %; conversely, even the slightest vision that the shorts are out and we're sitting here floating in space will likely tank the stock with sales across the world - and definitely kill a conspiracy theory or two. The stock would likely only go back up when the

For this key reason, I think this situation is a 50/50 gamble. If you'd like to keep the gamble going, or feel like the losses aren't worth realizing, then fuck it. You do you. I hope you research opportunity costs related to bagholding and are willing to pay them as you move forward as an investor. If you're **\*not\*** willing to take the gamble, then **\*don't\***, and stop dicking in the ass everybody who's willing to make a truly retarded play; after all, the spirit of this place isn't so black or white...

**\*TL;DR we don't know what the fuck is going on, but it's your choice what you do with your money. Pay attention, but don't let hecklers** ***\*\*or\*\**** **theorists obscure your vision of the future\***

Ape TLDR at the bottom you smooth brains

While researching batteries, I came across a corporation by the name of Energous (WATT). They are the leading the charge in a phenomenon called over-the-air wireless charging. Aka charging small electronics without needing to be contact with a surface or corded power supply, instead the device is charged by an RF transmitter.

Their primary product is called WattUp, the RF transmitters that allow them to charge devices over a frequency with a variety of applications - drones, medical devices, laptops, etc.

They have recently partnered with NewSound in December and received FCC approval for a WattUp enabled hearing aid, to eliminate the need to replace the small delicate batteries.

FCC approval for a WattUp enabled posture tracker.

They also have the first FCC permitted non-beam forming transmitter with a charging area of 1 meter, and a total of 230 patents as of Jan 2021. 

Finally, as of Jan 5th, they have completed a $40m at-the-market equity offering. 

This technology has incredible capabilities and could soon be found in any electronic device imaginable, and Energous is at the forefront. 

Currently shares are at 3.5~ from an all time high of 22.44. Currently both ITM and OTM options are pretty cheap with a nice average volume.

Title: A rational (and bullish) take on the current state of GME gang
I see a lot of FUD and bad DD going around r/wallstreetbets, and its time for more rational discussions about the state of GME and the potential for another bull run. It is possible, but people need to stop being next level retard. It is going to kill any opportunity to recover the stock unless we stop right now and get our heads straight on what's actually going on. So while I don't know shit and this isn't real financial advice, here's a more rational take on what we need to do to get GME moving again.

Full disclosure: I was in GME in early December at around $15, I was a pussy ass paper hands and folded a winning play of $35 call for Jan 15th when it looked more and more unlikely. I got back in immediately for Feb 19th calls and turned 4k into 70k. I took some profits on the way up (I felt bad for doing so but I knew it was the big brain move, and in the end I pocketed 40k on 4k investment so 0 complaints from me). I'm still holding $115 calls made when the stock was $70 for Feb 19th, and made more 250 calls recently for Feb 26th and Feb 12th at $130 and $100 yesterday. I'm holding all of these till bust, so I'm in it to the moon. I have some shares too but those are a long play, I don't look at them.

First, we need to accept or at least be open to the idea that the original short squeeze is done. The factors that led to it have changed, either the hedge funds reshorted at higher prices (around 200 most likely), or they can out last us because they know they have bail outs and the media has put the momentum against us. WE CANNOT COUNT ON THE ORIGINAL SHORT SQUEEZE TO REVIVE THIS STOCK. WHAT WE NEED IS AUTHENTIC BUYING AND NEW MOMENTUM.

On that note, stocks can move ridiculous prices on low volume. What we need is real, authentic retail buying at prices up to at least $200. But right now GME looks like a sinking ship and no one wants to touch it with a 100 foot pole. So how do we fix that? We still have momentum on our side from a large number of believers from around the GLOBE that want a part in this once in a lifetime story. This is powerful but has to be used right, and that's hard when the brokers are shutting us out. But hope is not lost, and restrictions should lift over time. We need patience and resilience.

We also need to stop telling people who aren't in this for the moment to hold till they die. Some people are losing REAL money over this and we're being complete assholes telling them to hold till they lose their life fortunes so we can make some tendies. Weak hands are going to sell and pressuring them to hold will make the FUD worse. If we want a come back we need the selling to stop, and that means we need to let the weak hands fold WHILE keeping the floor price above a certain level. Let's talk about volume. The recent 'low volume' isn't low compared to the past months, its just lower than the day when GME was THE MOST TRADED STOCK IN THE WHOLE FUCKING WORLD. Stop talking about volume. REAL selling has happened, which is probably the institutions and the paper hands folding. We need to let this energy run its course. Don't act like it's going to the moon and to buy at any price, save our bullets for the hard line in the sand.

Once the selling has stopped (and it will), we just need to regain momentum with organic buying.  People all over the world are waiting on the sidelines for GME to look like its picking up steam again and they will PILE THE FUCK ON just like last time. If we push the price high enough, we can trigger another short squeeze but it is NOT the same conditions as the first one. Stop with the bullshit about ladder attacks (which I've only heard of on this reddit) and us being cheated by the big man, that only scares people away because they think the game is unwinnable. It is STILL a giant fuck you to wall street just by making this stock rocket again, the game does not have to be rigged to make this a david vs goliath story. Whether it is or isn't, that only creates more FUD.

This sub needs to get its shit together. We need real authentic I LIKE THIS FUCKING STOCK for reasons OTHER than the short squeeze. Like GME just adding a fucking Amazon employee to the board and plans for it expanding online. There is REAL REASON to believe in GME, and that needs to turn into authentic buying, which will then create the momentum we need to get everyone else to pile on the stock again. But this shit about short squeezes and ladder attacks and $10,000 or bust needs to stop. It's just making this look like a sinking ship where everyone on it is stuck in the denial stage of grief. This stock has real potential to hit $300+ again, we just have to change our mind set and the game plan. And I'm too stupid to tell you how, but I know this isn't the way. So buy the fuck out of GME at current levels, but change the narrative to something that has actual basis in reality. And tell people to let the sellers sell so they stop keeping us down and we can get a real rally going. We have enough people on our side to move the needle and get the engine started again, its not over. But its gonna require patience and time and if you aren't in it for the long haul or are gonna pussy out on the way up then just sell now so we can start buying again. At this point, if you're not buying, either get off the ship or hold till death do us part.

Best of luck retards, I know we can do this

&amp;#x200B;

corsair has just announched about closing on public offering by selling insiders shares( of their highest owners -EagleTree which reduced ownership from 78% to 68%)  8,625,000 shares 35$ per share with 30-day option to buy another 1.13M shares.

in addition to that some of the executives of the company sold sold shares at 35$ which can be expected because it is the first time they cashed since the IPO.

&amp;#x200B;

**RISKS:**

* there's a risk associated with corsair bussiness which is they depend on third-party computer hardware, particularly graphic cards and CPUs, and video games. - if any of the above will see a decline  it may hard crsr business. - every year there's new GPUs, CPUs and video games, and corsair will be there to provide their equiment ! i dont see this bussiness declining soon, quite the ooposite - when people will get back to work they will have new money to spend on their PCs and game consoles, and dont forget about new stimulues.
* if eSports wont continue growing at the current rate and according to the excepted growth - there will be harm to sales.

&amp;#x200B;

POSITIVE:

* gaming and creator becoming pupolar and keep rising at the moment.(not due to covid)
* part of corsair products are used for "3 letters forbidden word" mining.(GPUs and Power supplies)
* alot of rgb product that attracts young audience.
* variaty of products to all costumers (20$-1000$+)
* still and young company with a very promising future ahead !
* covid lockdowns made alot of people more aware to computers and gaming
* Alot of influencers marketing corsair.

i think that corsair is perfectly positioned to continue growing, at the current rate they are a value play at a steal price. streamers and youtubers marketing corsair products and as a result corsair can expect to keep their growth in sales. they can generate billions each year in the up coming years and i really think they are under valued right now.

combine that with the crazy time we live in, shortage all over the world for GPUs, CPUs and gaming consoles - the demand is crazy and corsair will benefit as well.

at 21, jan corsair just filed [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743759/000119312521011458/d32212ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743759/000119312521011458/d32212ds1.htm) because of their latest "offering".

why do we care about that ? thanks to some guys from r\\investing i found that that apparently their next earning are already out and nobody talking about that.

**For the year ended December 31, 2020, we expect:**

** Net revenue to be between approximately $1,700 million and $1,701 million**

** Net income to be between approximately $101 million and $103 million**

** Adjusted EBITDA to be between approximately $211 and $213 million**

Yes, we already know they have beaten their own updated estimates

In fact, the company initially estimated the following (*from Q3 release* [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d))

For the full year 2020, we currently expect:

 Net revenue to be in the range of $1,616 million to $1,631 million.

 Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $178 million to $184 million.

 Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $187 million to $193 million.

Then, they updated the *guidance on November 30th 2020* ([https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-updates-full-year-2020-outlook](https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-updates-full-year-2020-outlook)):

For the full year 2020, we currently expect:

* Net revenue to be in the range of $1,651 million to $1,666 million.
* Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $186 million to $192 million.
* Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $194 million to $200 million.

**So they have beaten their own initial and revisited estimates. Great!! Really great!!**

**2)** But thats not all we can easily infer from the Prospectus dated January 21, 2021 (Again we just need to look).

As they mention on the Q3 report, as of September 30, 2020, we had cash and restricted cash of $120.1 million, $48.0 million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of $370.1 million.

In the more recent prospectus (page 10):

*In addition to the foregoing, as of December 31, 2020, we expect to have approximately $133 million in cash and restricted cash and we expect to have net debt of approximately $194 million following the repayment of $50.0 million in existing debt with cash on hand during the quarter ended December 31, 2020.*

**This means that they have reduced net debt from $250M ($370 - $120 of cash) to $194M, which implies $56M of free cash flow generated during the quarter.** As a reminder, they generated around 21M FCF in q3 2020 and 94M in the first 9 months of 2020. So **this implies around 150M FCF in 2020** (as a reference in the first 9 months of 2019, they had negative FCF of about 6M).

(check cash flow statement at page 14 on the Q3 report here [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d))

And about their operation statement which looks pretty promising, this is how a growth stock looks, i see a bright future for them.

30-35$ good support level, below that is a problem.

flag pattern been breached upward ! hoping to see 40$ holding strong and coming close to 50$ before er ! i believe the er run didnt even happen yet.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Corsair is a straight up strong tech company which holds greater value than the market see right now, earnings on feb\\9 will be fire and beyond the earning i see a huge growth for this company. possibility of reachin 60$ after er is HIGH. play by your own risk.

Disclosure:

i own 200 shares at the moment and about 6.5k in 50$ calls, might add another 15k next week.

Title: Why $SQ will crush Earnings (Earnings Play 02/23)
**Preamble:** $SQ is currently trading at \~$228. They report their earnings on 02/23 and they're going to crush it! I personally think it's pretty cheap and it'll definitely have a run up. $SQ has two Lines of Businesses: Seller and CashApp. The Seller segment includes Square's managed payment services, software solutions, hardware, and financial services offered to sellers. The Seller segment generated $409.3 million in gross profit in Q3 2020, up 12.5% compared to last fiscal quarter. The other line of business is CashApp which is like Venmo meets Robinhood. They offer retail trading for stocks like $AMC, $NOK, B\*T\*C, etc. and they charge a variable cost for each transaction. Hence, high-priced asset purchase = higher fee. High volume purchases = more $. And then of course, you have your cash wallet.

Here are my bull points:

**Seller Segment:**

* Between November 5 (last ER) - February 23 (upcoming ER) there was Christmas, Boxing Day, Cyber Monday, New Year's and Thanksgiving. These are are all holidays that Small Businesses highly benefit off of
   * Retail sales will be up and same store sales will be up. Hence, more $ for $SQ.
   * Considering their Q3 revenues were up vs. last fiscal (when COVID didn't exist) and last quarter, Q4 revenue will be tremendous.
* More small businesses are open compared to last quarter. Vaccine started being distributed late 2020 -&gt; more people shopping outside -&gt; more small businesses profiting -&gt; more $
* Most states (including businesses) are open ([https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html)).
* 2nd round of PPP: Credit lenders approved $5 billion loans in 1 week starting 2nd week of January 2021([https://www.fool.com/the-blueprint/over-60000-round-2-ppp-loans-already-approved/](https://www.fool.com/the-blueprint/over-60000-round-2-ppp-loans-already-approved/)). Small businesses aren't going anywhere and are here to stay.

**CashApp Segment:**

[$SQ vs. $PYPL vs. B\*T\*C Relative Pricing Chart](https://preview.redd.it/dktqnolq5df61.png?width=1311&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=973334c125737ffdef02ed247bdadc27eb5fe56f)

1. There was a very strong correlation between B\*T\*C and $SQ, but the derailment happened near the end of December. While B\*T\*C discovered new ATHs, $SQ remained stagnant. **Not priced in!**
2. According to survey results, 40% of retail traders who switched brokerages when the $GME, $AMC, etc. trading restrictions came about, they had migrated to CashApp. From this survey data gathered, Mizuho gives a PT of $300 ([https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3237659&amp;headline=SQ](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3237659&amp;headline=SQ)). **Not priced in!**
3. $PYPL earnings came out and claimed that C-currency had a big influence. Meanwhile, more C-currency is being traded via CashApp. **Not priced in!**
4. B\*T\*C trading volume nearly doubled vs. last quarter, and yet $SQ has only risen by 15%. **Not priced in!**

 **Other Bullish Points:**

* 1% of $SQ's asset is in B\*T\*C. B\*T\*C nearly 3x'd in the past 3 months. Meaning their B\*T\*C asset value 3x'd vs. last quarter. **Probably priced in.**
* CashApp 7th most downloaded in app store:

**Bearish Points:**

* The gremlin look alike that is Jack Dorsey is currently selling
* $ARKK is lowering the weighting of $SQ and $PYPL

**Assumptions:**

* EMT
* B\*T\*C doesn't crash before earnings

Take advantage of the low pricing right now to get in and using ER as hedge if you're planning to sell before expiry.

Title: Lets face it.
Listen up retards. I know nobody wants to hear this and I know its going against everything you all want to see right now but we need to face some serious fucking reality here.

Anyone who didnt sell last week at the peak or around the peak, or on the way down, Welcome to the Bag Holders club. 

Now I know yall are gonna downvote bomb me or be really upset about this shit, but its the fucking truth. 

We need to understand this and realise what our options are now. 

This place become a giant echo chamber of rockets and diamonds and 10k Is NoT A MeMe bullshit. It was definitely a fucking meme and a lot of people got sucked into that absolute bullshit.

The big money bailed on us, they were happy to leave us bag holding if we were stupid enough to do it. (Spoiler alert: we were) there are no such thing as ladder attacks, everyone looks fucking stupid when they say this, the OG members of WSB are laughing at us all in a hidden thread. 

There is no squeeze coming. There is no more big money buying in. The squeeze narrative is gone, we can hold until were old and dead and out autistic grandchildren have our stocks, it doesnt matter anymore. 

You need to realise if youre still holding now, youre now a long term investor. Congratu-fucking-lations. 

This is now a value play. Long term.

The reason I personally got in was because I believed this from the get go, before I knew about a fucking short squeeze.

I realised Ryan Cohen and his team are going to turn GameStop around and its going to be beautiful. Imagine getting on Netflix before it was Netflix, while they were still shipping DVDs? This is where we are with GameStop right now. 

The price will increase again, it will be valuable but it wont happen for a long time. And it probably might not ever go to $400+ again. (Sorry bag holders at $400+) 

Youre a long term investor now if youre still in. Youre options are this. 

1. sell for a loss now.
2. Hold and be patient, have faith in RC and the process.
3. Keep being a delusional idiot and getting laughed at. 

Thats it. Thats the options. 

My position is 150 shares of GME at an average of $70. Im bag holding with you idiots. 

TLDR: Welcome to the #BagHoldersClub, would you like a drink you autistic fucking morons? Or perhaps a fresh serving of crayons?

Title: Hope this explains the GME situation a bit. 
I am an ape, not a financial advisor. While i was eating my wifes boyfriends  I stumbled upon this nice read from r/investing. I didnt write this. simply passing on what I saw and before you apes hate just take some time to read and hopefully lift your spirits back up from the battle. 

GME Options data shows Shorts think you'll disband by March

Just wanted everyone to take a look at this write up DD below. 

Hope it helps bring some clarity. Tried to post it in thread but it has images so can't

edit: TLDR: 

Title: Canoo (GOEV)
Ok here is my first shot at a DD. I've been eyeing this company Canoo (GOEV) for a little while. I'm long 1200 shares @ a cost of $15.28

[https://www.canoo.com/](https://www.canoo.com/)

Canoo is a new EV start-up that plans to have a vehicle subscription service. From their investor presentation, it looks like they estimate $90,000 revenue on a car over 12 years. That means the cost per month for their subscription model is $625 per month, all in, no down payment, no insurance cost, they take care of maintenance, etc.

Link:[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ea125677ex99-2\_hennessy.htm?fbclid=IwAR2as\_F2t-ZrmXWjKGvDLROdeSmL5ByctPw3W0VuqEcOHYjZggG3d5FX4T4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ea125677ex99-2_hennessy.htm?fbclid=IwAR2as_F2t-ZrmXWjKGvDLROdeSmL5ByctPw3W0VuqEcOHYjZggG3d5FX4T4)

Now, I know that seems a bit expensive but it seems that $625/mon is cheaper than the low end of the average of owning a gas-powered car at $750-916/mon. It has a barrier-of-entry because there is no down payment. I don't know how that will play out with most people. I personally like owning my own vehicle, but it could be popular with younger people because again, they wouldn't need to worry about any maintenance or insurance. Now, I do think their subscription model would be very popular among large companies that need a cheap, low-maintenance fleet of vehicles. I hope they're trying to land a contract with a company like UPS or FedEx.

What I like most about this company is their "skateboard" platform which is the bottom half of the car. From my understanding, they would just need to crash test one of each skateboard. Any vehicle, regardless of the configuration, would also have that crash rating, which is an amazing cost saving when they can sell a bunch of units to a larger car manufacture, like Hyundai, with whom they already have a partnership.

Link:[https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia)  


It is reported that Apple tried to buy Canoo in 2020 but Canoo turned them down. Apple has apparently partnered with Hyundai to enter the EV-space, I think because Apple really liked Canoo's customizable platform. Apple couldn't buy them so they joined them in a roundabout way.

[https://www.slashgear.com/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-report-electric-vehicle-skateboard-platform-autonomous-ev-roadmap-13654915/](https://www.slashgear.com/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-report-electric-vehicle-skateboard-platform-autonomous-ev-roadmap-13654915/)  


Having said all that, they won't have any vehicles out until 2022 so be wary of that, but this is a long-term hold for me.

Canoo (GOEV) currently trades at $16.40, hitting its all-time high at $22.30 in December. So, it hasn't had a crazy break-out yet but I'm confident there will be one closer to launch.

Title: DD on the GREEK SYMBOLS and OPTIONS EXPLAINED and AN ANALYSIS of a Call Option and an Example - The Final Paper
Using *THE GREEKS* to Analyze a Call Option Contract for Can't Stop, Won't Stop Corporation

&amp;#x200B;

Example:

\--------$160 Strike Price Call EXP Feb. 12, 2021 --------**$160c 2/12**

Current Price: Bid x $10.00 **Last x 10.83** x Ask x11.65

Current Greeks for contract (These are important for calculations)

** Delta: 0.3438

 Gamma:  0.0055

 Theta:  -1.36

 Vega: 0.0534P Rho: 0.0052

&amp;#x200B;

## What is delta and how is it used?

Delta is a useful metric to help traders measure the impact that movement in an underlying security will have on the value of their option positions. Delta is not a static numberit fluctuates due to a number of factors including the price of the underlying security, time to expiration, and volatility.

## The standard definition of delta is:

Change in the option price  change in the stock price

## Why is delta important?

1. **Measuring expected change in option price.** Delta can be used to calculate how much an options premium is theoretically expected to change in response to a $1 move in the underlying security. For example, a call option with a delta of 0.50 would be expected to rise in value by about $0.50 if the underlying stock or ETF rises by $1.
2. **Calculating the percentage of price risk.** Delta also represents the percentage of price risk of stock ownership that is currently represented in the option. So, a call option with a delta of 0.70 has 70% of the price risk versus owning the stock outright. If an investor wanted a greater or lesser amount of price risk, they could choose an option with higher or lower deltas.
3. **Determining the probability that an option will expire in the money.** Finally, delta measures the approximate probability that at expiration the option will be in-the-money by at least $0.01 or more. Therefore, a call with a delta of 0.05 only has a 5% chance at that moment in time that the stocks price will be higher than the options strike price at expiration.

2/3/21 **Delta: .3438**

**Every $10 up in stock price = +$3.438**

## What is gamma and how is it used?

Gamma is another widely used metric for options trading. It is most often used by traders with large positions, but grasping how it works can help any trader gain a better understanding of how options behave.

## The standard definition of gamma is:

Change in the delta  change in the stock price

## Why is gamma important?

Gamma measures the rate at which an options delta changes as the underlying security moves. The gamma of an option reflects the change in the delta in response to a $1 move in the underlying security. For example, a call option with a gamma of 0.02 and a delta of 0.50 would be expected to change to a 0.52 delta if the underlying stock or ETF rises by $1.

&amp;#x200B;

2/3/21 **Delta: 0.3438Gamma 0.055  (Delta+Gamma = .3493)**

**Every $10 up in the stock price = +$3.493**

&amp;#x200B;

## What is theta and how is it used?

Theta measures the impact that the passage of time will have on an options price

## The standard definition of theta is:

Change in the option price  one day change in time

Theta represents how much an options premium is expected to decay per day with all other market factors and variables remaining the same. For example, a call option valued at $3 with a theta of $0.05 is expected to be worth about $2.95 tomorrow.

Theta can change as the options get closer to expiration. For example, options with a significant time premium (e.g., those with strike prices closest to the current underlying security price) tend to see theta growing larger as expiration approaches. Another thing to keep in mind: Theta is exponential, not linear. That means the time decay of an option accelerates more each day as it moves closer to expiration.

## Why is theta important?

Time decay is an important concept in options trading. Theta is the metric that quantifies it, so that you can estimate how quickly you might make or lose money on an option strategy as time passes. However, remember that theta (like all the Greeks) is a theoretical estimate of what is expected to occur over time. On any given day, supply and demand in the market will determine whether an options price rises or falls.

&amp;#x200B;

2/3/21 **Theta: -1.36 Decay  minus $1.36 per day**

**Current price: $10.83 - per day x minus $1.36 = $9.47 price tomorrow if nothing changes.**

## What is vega and how is it used?

Vega measures the impact that changes in implied volatility will have on the price of an option contract. Volatility can have a major impact on your options trade, so vega can be important for assessing the risk-reward profile of a given strategy.

## The standard definition of vega is:

Change in the option price  percentage-point change in implied volatility

Specifically, vega represents the expected change in an options price for a one percentage point change in its implied volatility. For example, if implied volatility rises from 23% to 24%, a call option with a vega of 0.14 would be expected to rise in value by $0.14.

## Why is vega important?

Vega plays a critical role in determining the risk-reward potential of a potential option trade. If traders believe an option to be overvalued or undervalued, they may look at vega to decide which options and/or options strategies have the most profit potential.

2/3/21 **Vega: .0534**

**For Every 1% change in Implied Volatility (IV) = +$.0534 per pointi.e. 50% up would mean $.0534 x 50 points = +$2.67**

**Today was 373.1 IV - THAT'S CRAZY VOLATILITY.**

**The 52-week high for IV was 400.**

**There's a chance this breaks 400 tomorrow. ($.0534 x (400 - 373.1) = +$26.95 potential**

**Implied Volatility for Gamestop Corporation:**

**Current	        373.1**

**52-Wk Avg	97.3**

**52-Wk High	400.0**

**52-Wk Low	33.1**

&amp;#x200B;

## What is rho and how is it used?

Rho measures an option contracts sensitivity to interest rate changes, and is expressed as the expected change in an options value given a one percentage point change in interest rates.

## The standard definition of rho is:

Change in the option price  percentage-point change in interest rates

How is rho used? For example, a call option with a rho of 0.02 would be expected to rise in value by $0.02 if interest rates rise from 2% to 3%. Rho can be positive or negative, but has the strongest impact on longer-term options and is often considered less important than the other Greeks by traders who focus on shorter-term options.

## Why is rho important?

In a low-interest rate environment, rho has a less measurable impact on option prices compared to delta, vega, gamma, and theta. Still, it is another metric that can be used to help understand how options are influenced by interest rates and may have some bearing on longer-term options positions.

&amp;#x200B;

2/3/21 **Rho: .0052 = +$0.052 per 1% change in interest rate of borrowing sharesi.e. if borrowed shares interest rate goes from 19% to 29% = 10 points x .0052 = +$0.052 extra to the option price**

&amp;#x200B;

# The Summary:

**For every $10 move up in the share price tomorrow; the options price will increase 35.13% (based on Case TWO)**

**Case ONE:**

\[IV is +1% and Interest Rate Increases by 1% and Common Share Price increases by $10\] = +$2.19**Gamma - Theta + Vega + Rho = total basic greeks**

**$3.493  -  $1.36 + ($.0534 for every 1% move in IV) + ($.0052 for every 1% loan interest increase) = +$2.19 (total basic greeks) / Current option premium price $10.83 = +20.22%**

&amp;#x200B;

**Case TWO:**

\[IV is +30% and Interest Rate increases from 19% to 29% and Common Share Price increases by $10\]**Gamma - Theta + Vega + Rho**

**$3.493  -  $1.36 + ($.0534 x 30% move in IV= $1.62) + ($.0052 for every 1% loan interest increase = $.052) = $3.805 + Current option premium price**

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**SO PER EVERY $10 Move in SHARE PRICE, The Analyzed Option Premium Price Increased $3.805 or 35.13% from Last price on 2/3/21 of $10.83**

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: **SO PER EVERY $10 Move in SHARE PRICE,The Analyzed option (Can't Stop Won't Stop Corporation 2/21 160c) Increases $3.805 or 35.13% based upon Case TWO with 30% IV increase and 10% Interest Rate increase.**

**If there is continuous BUYing and HODLing of shares and buying 2/5 call options  and the share price goes higher bc of diamond hands and buying by oldcomers and newcomers, the options price will continue to rise 35.13% every $10 increase in share price based upon Case 2 and can be even more as IV goes higher or Interest Rate borrowing % goes higher.**

&amp;#x200B;

What would happen to the 2/5 Calls if the stock price rises every $10. Exponential Growth Possibly and the Final Squoze. The Share price needs to increase in a dramatic and volatile fashion. If 2/5 and 2/12 options are bought up and share price increases dramatically, the price will continue to go up infinitely until the shorts cover or are margin called.

I am not a financial advisor, blah blah blah, I like the stock and call option, so I analyzed a particular call option and gave different scenarios.

Title: Regshi FINRA update Feb 3rd
$GME

Volume short: 9638240 
Tot Volume: 17735739

54% shorts

If we assume the same ration for real total volume (higher than the one reported to FINRA)
That's around 22.7 M shares short today

If we assume that any other transaction was a cover then:
New shorts (not covered) = 3.5 M

The data since 27/01 is more than 50% every day. Meaning more shorts overall. 

It's still possible Melvin is out (at least partially)
It's still possible that they are covering old shorts with new one (like cover a short at 30$ keeping open one at 90$, or averaging up), new shorts are supposed to be more expensive in term of interests though

Very basic DD, consider the assumptions though.

TL;DR 
Short positions are likely to be increasing since the 27/01 according to FINRA daily data.



Title: DD on $TSM, a play on the auto industry Semiconductor Shortage.
I work at a hyundai dealer, our corporate a month ish ago sent us links to articles about the coming semiconductor shortage in the auto industry. The shortage is forcing many manufacturers to hault or slow productions. This was technically good news for us as hyundai dealer as hyundai manufacturers their own and wont be effected. 

The shortage has affected Volkswagen, Ford Motor Co, Subaru Corp, Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co Ltd, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and other car makers. 

But why should we autists care about this shortage, Ticker $TSM. 

Now, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, ticker $TSM has only dipped their toes into supplying for the auto industry. 3% of sales were related to the auto industry in 2020. They are being pushed by these manufacturers to change routes to help supply for this shortage. 

From the article, "In 2020, auto chips accounted only for 3% of TSMC's sales, lagging smartphones' 48% and 33% for high performance chips.
In the fourth quarter, sales for TSMC's auto chips jumped 27% from the previous quarter, but still only accounted for 3% of overall sales in the quarter." "Germany has asked Taiwan to persuade Taiwanese manufacturers to help ease a shortage of semiconductor chips in the auto sector which is hampering its fledgling economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic."
"The ministry told Reuters that it had received requests from both the United States and the European Union through "diplomatic channels" late last year, as well as from Germany and Japan this year." 
Long story short $TSM

Title: You enjoy watching xQc / Shroud / Ninja / TheStockGuy? You think live streaming has a bright future? Read this DD about $HUYA
Long time twitch viewer, long time investor, 1 year old WSB member lurker. I'm a millenial and have been in the stock market for about 5 years. POGCHAMP.

Twitch is the north american leader of live streaming and I would love to invest in it. Here is the problem: Amazon owns twitch, therefore if you want to invest in twitch, you need to pay for amazon shares. Twitch is a drop in the ocean.

The only equivalent companies I have found are $HUYA and $DOYU which are both live streaming leaders in china.

&amp;#x200B;

**BOOMERS have actually shorted $HUYA stock for 35% of the floating shares.** I guarantee you that the shorting boomers don't have the slightest fucking clue how the business model of live streaming platforms work. They don't understand the strong sense of community that twitch builds upon and why people would donate money willingly to their favorite streamers. I have seen the twitch viewers grow from the past years and I don't see it stopping anytime soon considering millenials are growing older and so is Gen Z.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that nobody cares about fundamentals these days but just look at those numbers:

HUYA sales in 2016 (In Millions of CNY): 796.904

HUYA sales in 2019 (In Millions of CNY): 8,374.501

&amp;#x200B;

The growth of live streaming platforms is absolutely insane and I believe it is the future instead of regular T.V. The market cap of $HUYA is only 6.1 Billion$ which makes it even more attractive for WSB buyers if they decide to like the stock. Considering the huge spike of interest in the stock market by the younger generation, and the fact that AOC had 300k concurrent viewers on twitch when she was talking about the $GME saga. It shows the bright future of this industry all over the world.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, the gaming giant Tencent ($TCEHY) owns shares of $HUYA so this literally can't go tits up.

&amp;#x200B;

THE RISKS OF THIS INVESTMENT

&amp;#x200B;

IMO, the real risk of this investment would be the content restrictions that can be imposed at anytime by the chinese government.

It doesn't concern me too much because even though they can decide to ban video games at any time, people still feel a strong sense of community with a particular streamer. 

At some point people do not even care for what video games their favorite streamer decides to play. A good example would be the streamer xQc on the twitch platform. 

My man can play overwatch/valorant and even chess. He will retain an average of 70k+ viewers every single time.

&amp;#x200B;

DISCLAIMER:

&amp;#x200B;

Not a financial advisor (aka retarded). I'm pretty fucking biased considering I have 25k on the line in call options but hey, I put money on my thesis.

Title: Part 4 - $BB No Meems (plus $GME $AMC $NOK) - Ties that Bind
  

Welcome to the continuation of this incoherent tirade. [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/)  [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamill/bb_dd_no_meems_part_2/)  [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb4e2m/part_3_bb_dd_no_meems_fuck_the_memes/) linked. 

$BB went up today. Is that good for $BB investors &amp; bagholders? Yes, you grunt, drooling onto your weighted blanket. But axchuaallly..shit I dont know Im just a retard but I think the answer is sort of, only maybe. 

I updated my chart from yesterday. As we in the $BB gang already know, $BB's a [steady eddy space shuttle headed to mar](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/)s. If you even look @ the price anymore you're a puss looking at prices are for paper hands. 

But look at this fucking thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Live by $BANG, Die by $BANG](https://preview.redd.it/qyd7aorh8cf61.png?width=546&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ffa10ba469718f6939f3eb9f85288d3ead95bae)

**Look at the correlation.** For the smooth brains  you might think yeah no shit those are the most common tickers on reddit so what. 

So WHatt??? This is a weird thing!!!! **There is no** ***fundamental*** **(yes many of you don't have that word in your vocab idc bite me) reason** for these stocks to trade tegoether. *Why the fuck would an Endpoint security company, a vidya retailer, a movie chain, and some Fininsh 5(g) provider trade in tandem other than just being meme stocks?* 

Re: the downwards movement, my hypothesis was [degrossing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-30/a-reddit-army-descends-on-hedge-funds-chained-by-risk-models?sref=NJllTNWZ)  / [margin calls on retail account](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamill/bb_dd_no_meems_part_2/)s - $BANG was the most commonly held basket in RobinHood accounts this past few weeks and dips get exacerbated by margin calls .

But.....what goes down must also go up. Said another way  Whats causing correlation on the upswings as well? **Why would buyers of $BB today also be buying a*****, a vidya retailer, a movie chain, and some Fininsh 5(g) provider****,* especially after the loss porn of the past few days? **And especially since the front page has been dominated almost entirely by $GME / $AMC ?** 

*BTW the reason some of the $BB GANG want a conscious decoupling (it's not you...it's us) from the memes (fuck the memes) is so that people can realize the true fundamental value of Papa Chens Cyber Co. vs. the continual austistic screeching about Janet Yellin and Melvin (newsflash Melvin got the fuck out already)*

Anyways  So the question is sure, initially some retards bought the whole $BANG before $GME blasted off, but why is that still holding true? My theory, having a number of acquaintances @ hedge funds (no none of them Melvin fuck you)  is - yesits WSBs favoriate bogeyman - those very same hedge funds. 

As [Chamath so eloquently described](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/chamath-palihapitiya-closes-gamestop-position-but-defends-individual-investors-right-to.html) as he verbally tore CNBC a new asshoe, hedgies may wear infinitely finer suits and sport cleaner underwear but they chase the very same tendies. The dirty little scecret is a big part of what they do is **momentum chasing**  Buying what goes up and selling what goes down. 

Those initial shackles binding $BANG were the idiots here (including me) who bought $BANG in various combinations. But now those shackles are wrapped in **$BILLIONS$** of load-bearing momentum strategies. Long shorts funds. Market neutral funds. And, perhaps ***most hilariously***, the [black box quant strategies](https://www.ft.com/content/81811f27-4a8f-4941-99b3-2762cae76542) with Harvard PhD-designed models that probably  accidentally - now have a meme basket that they trade, punting on shares of $BB, $NOK, $AMC, and $GME like the most retarded amongst us. 

# TLDR  I LIKE $BB MID AND LONG TERM, AND EVENTUALLY IT NEEDS TO DECOUPLE FROM $BANG TO ACHIEVE TRUE GREATNESS. BUT IN THE SHORT TERM I AM PRAYING TO CHEETO JESUS FOR YOU $GME / $AMC /$NOK BROTHERS  FOR BETTER OR WORSE WE'RE ALL BONDED TIGHER THAN [VLAD'S CLENCHED BUTTHOLE.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-calls-robinhood-ceo-vlad-the-stock-impaler-and-grills-him-over-the-gamestop-saga-11612180184)

*PS If I were less of a retard I might try to design an option spread to take advantage of the (1) $BANG correlation and (2) the fact that $BB and $NOK swings are more muted. Theres $$$ to be made there I think some of you smart options monkeys figure that one out. Other interesting ways to make $$$* *- Betting on what tickers (Tootsie roll gang anyone? Fuck that one lost me a lot of $$) become meme stocks and drop out of being a meme stock*

*Disclaimer I'm balls deep in $BB and am a retard who just likes the stock do your own research*

I found [this](https://technosports.co.in/2021/01/30/the-u-s-administration-calls-a-meeting-with-taiwanese-chipmakers-to-discuss-the-chip-crisis/) link the other day and really havent seen much news otherwise than the fact we are having a chip [shortage](https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/tsmc-says-expediting-auto-products-005621030.html).

Apparently the administration is having a meeting with TSM to pressure them to increase their supply.  With the Democrats positive view towards Taiwan Im hoping there is some positive buzz.

Disclaimer, I do have 5 2/12 130$ calls which I considered a very conservative bet given theyve been underperforming the market recently on lower volume than it had at the beginning of the year.

Title: $TAKOF - Drone Delivery Canada DD
 tl;dr: $*TAKOF* is taking off and going places. Rockets (or batteries) have been fueled  up we go! Im not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice.

(**Sources in comments**)

Longer version

My investment strategy is finding a stock that will perform well in medium/long term. I usually try to take profits or cut losses within one year, so look for companies that should benefit from what is happening around the world (be it Covid, green revolution, retail industry tendencies). Today Ill share my opinion about future of deliveries.

For quite a while there has been a buzz around drone deliveries. Be it Amazon Prime Air, UPS Flight Forward, DHL Parcelcopter (my favorite because of this ridiculous name), Boeings Matternet Everyone with the capacity to is trying to jump on this ship. You can read more about latest developments and companies working in Source 1.

Why theres such race to develop unmanned cargo air vehicles and autonomous flight technology you might ask? Well, drone doesnt get sick, can workday and night, it doesnt have to take breaks or spend half of its time chatting around or staring at its phone. It also doesnt need any contributions to its pension fund or healthcare insurance (needs insurance nevertheless, but technical insurances should come at much better rate than insuring a ball of flesh against all that world could throw at it). Finally, drones dont care if theres pandemic raging outside or boogaloo boys are stepping on the grass around some government building.

Drone comes off for the buyer as a one-time purchase cost, thus saving loads of cash in the lung run. Many businesses are taking more green approach to their business and calculate their CO2 footprint. Given that drones are powered by electricity (all the attention to the renewable energy, wink wink) it would also help business to boast about reducing carbon footprint while improving their efficiency.

One might think of one issue here: drones are cool and stuff, but what about the battery - it might not be able to cover required distance? Worry not, there are already solutions for this. Mainly ultra-fast charging stations (charge time: 5 minutes) or wireless charging hotspots (charge time: 6 minutes). Check out Source 2 and Source 3.

All in all I believe that drones have a bright future ahead of them and $*TAKOF* is one of the players in this industry.

**Company**: Founded in 2014, Drone Delivery Canada has developed a proprietary and patented turnkey drone delivery solution. The company is fully commercialized, operational, and revenue generating.

DDC has developed a drone delivery platform solution which is cost effective, highly scalable and can provide next generation logistic services to various market sectors including: retail, ecommerce, parcel &amp; post, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, mining, oil &amp; gas, logistics companies, Indigenous Communities, military and government agencies, in Canada and internationally. The Companys patented, fully integrated hardware/software platform is used as a managed service in a SaaS business model. Drone Delivery Canada is fully commercialized, operational and revenue-generating, with a robust sales funnel of global prospects. [https://dronedeliverycanada.com](https://dronedeliverycanada.com/)

So far, the company has signed test flight agreements with several major corporations. A medical facility in Ontario, two remote First Nations communities in the same province, GlobalMedic, and Air Canada have all agreed to test the companys drones. Last year, it also struck a partnership with European logistics/transport group DSV Panalpina A/S.

**Latest Catalysts**: Drone Delivery Canada plans to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) into its disruptive drone delivery solution (Source 4); Drone Delivery Canada has been named to the 2021 OTCQX Best 50 (Source 5); In January 2021, the FAA added new rules to 14 CFR Part 107 to permit the expansion of routine flights and created four categories of UAS for flights over suburban/urban areas (Source 6)

**Upcoming Catalysts**: release of Q4 and 2020 results; in July company started process to entering US market  at some point there will be announcement if this is a success.

**Industry Catalyst**: establishment of a legal basis for unmanned cargo air vehicles, battery technology and wireless charging developments.

Research by Goldman Sachs suggests the market potential could be as big as US$100 billion (CA$130 billion). Meanwhile, startups in the sector are nearly all worth less than $1 billion today (source 7  claims $*TAKOF* has multi-bagger also discusses $*TAKOF* cash position).

**Summary**: $*TAKOF* is ready for a take off! Its literally in their name. 3 rockets.

Seriously, given all the craziness in the current market I wouldnt rule out this reaching $10 in the next months. Especially if expansion to US is confirmed.

My position: 1k shares at $1.22

Thats it. Now do your own DD. Im not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice.

Title: The real short squeeze could be retail holding a big % of the shares.
So, we all know that GameStop has a bright future.  

They thought it was a Blockbuster--when really, we'd become leaders of a gamer marketplace and a leader in esports entertainment. We still don't have Ryan Cohen's game plan~~but you know it's gonna be fire. 

The VW squeeze was all about supply and demand. So what happens when major investors want to buy shares of GME? Well, they're gonna have to buy them from you. And I hear that gorillas don't sell. 

The real short squeeze might be in a year, because of all the diamond hands gorillas that like the stock and aren't selling. We might own 20% of the shares right now.

Who knows? I got into this because of my fascination with pressing buttons!

The reason I have doubts is because the Total Volume reported for 1/13 for instance don't match up to the total transaction volume for 1/13 - 26Mil vs 143Mil.  [https://imgur.com/a/fv7IXpU](https://imgur.com/a/fv7IXpU)

Edit1: Folks I know 2/9 is the real deal, but I am trying to get a handle on the daily data by Finra.

Edit2: If you sum up Total Volume from 12/30 to 1/15 we get \~34Mill which again doesn't match the \~62Mill reported on [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/).

Edit3: There doesn't appear to be any correlation between OTC short vol vs NYSE reported short volume for GME: [https://imgur.com/a/DYKs7HK](https://imgur.com/a/DYKs7HK)

Edit4: No correlation with %shorts either (shares shorted/ Total volume)  - Total Volume includes the entire trade volume, so I am not surprised.

Title: (GME) GameStop and Microsoft Strategic Partnership, First Step for the Acquisition?
There is something strange here. One missing piece of the puzzle. The company (GME) didn't talk at all on what happened in the stock market. Although large majority of [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) apes are gamers, the company preferred to stay silent. I would like to talk about it also here. (Edit: I thought it was well know, [Microsoft Official Partnership with GameStop from the official website](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/))

# GameStop didn't say a word about the stock market events, why? Can it be a very tight contract for a future acquisition by Microsoft?

**Their silence** is the main point here. **Why they didn't talk?** They were in the simple position to make a simple interview that was going be seen by all the world in stick and say: "*we are looking forward to innovate. We can adapt our business bla bla new technologies and bla bla new directors*". That's it, and that's obvious. What kind of company is not going to believe something like that?

Why in the hell GME didn't talk at all? they were surely able to say something vague and rhetorical in case they didn't really want to support us. They were also surely contacted by the press, and invited in some cool TV show. **It was their choice. They actively chose to not talk**. Maybe they thought that this is a bubble and they didn't want to make it bigger, still they were totally able to say bla bla innovation bla bla Cohen bla bla future. Or they were preparing some financial report and they were obligate by some boomer law to not talk at all. Or, maybe, they have a contract, an agreement with some other more powerful entity that is forbidding GME to talk on certain topics / under certain circumstances.

Let's imagine the last one. **Let's imagine that** **GME cannot talk due to some contract boundaries**. Contract whit whom? I would say **Microsoft**. Microsoft is powerful, big, rich, and they are partners already. Better: **strategic partners**. *What if this partnership is the first step for an acquisition?*

I know, anti-trust regulations can have something to say about it

That is what I see:

* **Blackrock** (I love Blackrock, high growth + 2% dividends annualized? lovely), **Michael Burry** (yeah, the guy of The Big Short), and [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/), all of them purchased a big chunk of GME. Why? did some of them hear some interesting rumour? Did they smell something that we didn't smell?
* New CEO. **Ryan Cohen** join the board to innovate the business completely. Why? someone else suggested this? He wanted to do it by himself? Press is pushing the narrative that Cohen put one foot out of his bed one morning and said: "*I wanna be the CEO of GameStop*". Randomly?
* Strategic **Partnership with Microsoft**. I don't know which one comes first, if this or Cohen, I guess some ape can check meticulously. You know how does it sound to me? It sounds like the first step to do an acquisition. Among all the solutions Microsoft chose to partener with GameStop. Ok. And if the partnership goes very well, what will happen? they will keep staying just partners?
* The value of GME shares just skyrocketed and **GameStop didn't say anything about it.** With no reason? They decided to not support the internet riot made basically by gamers or people in target (age / income / demography / interests / lifestyle). From a Marketing perspective doesn't sound right to me. Press, journalists, social media, TVs they wanted a comment from GameStop. Everybody was screaming for the official point of view from the company, and GameStop decided to stay silent. *Usually companies pay good money to go on TV*, this time it was going to be free advertising. So why they refused free advertising (free money)? For one good reason surely. What reason can it be? Must be a good one. A contract maybe? Yeah, it can be. And with whom? a contract with a big one. A big one like Microsoft? Maybe.
* The **average gamer** is getting older, and richer. Every guy born in the late 80s now has a job (should have one I hope). Good customer base, growing in numbers, growing in income, cannot go down = secure income for a company. ***How would you get them all (all gamers in the world) if you were Microsoft?*** Acquisition. The acquisition of a gaming company I would say can be one of the easiest, safest, fastest way available to get a big piece of this customer segment (gamers).

Am I right? am I wrong? Only time will tell us

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice. The below might be entirely wrong, I'm fucking retarded please don't listen to me.

Over the past few days S3 has been publishing updated short interest on GME and it has no doubt had an impact on price. First they published regular SI% of Float metric but then they pushed S3 SI% of Float on the market which appeared to show a drop from &gt;100% SI/Float  to &lt;60% S3 SI/Float in just a few days (notice how these are different metrics). S3 SI% of float calculation is extremely misleading.

S3 originally was publishing a basic calculation for SI/Float. You simply take the number of shares sold short and divide by the number of shares trading (float). Okay simple. What this community took advantage of with GME was more shares were shorted than were trading. It was a brilliant trade for a bunch of retarded smooth brained apes like you. So what happened? Did the squeeze get squoze?

Well, S3 decided you couldn't short more than were trading (I'll let you smooth brains do your own research into the origins of S3 partners but you can probably guess) so, late last week they started pushing their own metric "S3 SI% of Float". From a post found [here](https://s3partners.com/notesonfloat.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=020321), they state:

&gt;Stocks with SI % of Float over 100% highlight the difference between these two calculations. In early January, GMEs SI % of Float was 141.86%, while S3 SI % of Float was 58.65%. Just as no one can get five quarts of milk from a gallon jug, no one can short more shares of stock than exist.  
&gt;  
&gt;While the numerators in these calculations are identical (71.19mm were the shares shorted in both calculations), the denominator for the traditional calculation was 50.19mm (the float) and 121.38mm for the S3 SI % Float (float + shares shorted). The traditional calculation misrepresented the actual tradable shares in GME. The 141.86% is a nonsensical number, while the 58.65% reveals that there are not many shares left to short in GME, and that future trading pressure will predominantly come from the long side of the market.

Since you guy's can't read, what they did was make "new and better calculation". This new calculation is:

`S3 SI% of Float = Shares Sold Short/(Float + Shares Sold Short)`

They say this better accounts for the true liquidity in the market. Whatever. Not going to comment on the value of their metric but the IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW IS IT IS NOT THE SAME AS WHAT WE'VE BEEN GOING OFF OF.

This metric should be completely ignored IMO for the purposes of determining our progress on the short squeeze. I'll show you why with a pretty picture using their special calculation.

Assume you have a stock with a float of 100. This float is held fixed and somebody starts shorting. The graph below shows how S3's SI% of Float would change as more shares of this stock were shorted and float held constant (even though they think shorting dilutes the float). We'll see how this looks below:

[Theoretical &amp;#37;SI\/Float Comparison holding float constant](https://preview.redd.it/op62fauaubf61.png?width=593&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d6da23e48e12a9aa92aff2d4ad9a66b05957b8d)

As you can see above, S3's calculation is very different from what we've been going off of in our pursuit of the GME short squeeze thesis. It's actually a fucking asymptote, you can never get to 100%. By switching to looking at S3's metric it looks like there's been a massive decrease in short interest when NOT MUCH HAS REALLY CHANGED.

TLDR: The squeeze has likely not been squoze and S3 Partner's SI/Float metric is not a useful tool for measuring it.

Title: CorMedix Moonrise DD
Huge chance no one reads this because you're all watching the GME fuckathon while your wife's boyfriend is begging you to sell and constantly parroting "I told you so"

But

With the PDUFA date of Defencath only 25 days away now I'm going to be posting the amazing DD by [u/issapunk](https://www.reddit.com/u/issapunk/) evaluating the approval and buyout potential of CorMedix CR(M)D. The stock is up around 50% so far this week. I tried to post this multiple times on Monday but apparently the ticker is banned by the sub which is ridiculous,  but I don't want all of you autists to miss out on potential tendies.

here are my [positions](https://imgur.com/a/aJB8YgO)

Awesome DD by [u/issapunk](https://www.reddit.com/u/issapunk/) below. Hopefully this sub hasn't gone full [r/all](https://www.reddit.com/r/all/) and people still are interested in this shit:

&gt;CR(M)D (Cormedix) has been my golden goose since July 2018. I believe they will either partner-up or (more likely, imo, get bought out). I am going to explain my reasoning why, either way, I think this has the most upside in the market right now (I own lots of shares and options, trying to time the explosion)  
&gt;  
&gt;They developed a catheter-lock solution (solution that helps reduce infections) called DefenCath (formerly called Neutrolin). This is a huge issue in the world and hundreds of thousands of people die from this annually -with a mortality rate of about 25%.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the midst of the largest Phase 3 trial for HD, it was halted due to efficacy by the Data Safety Monitoring Board. Meaning, the board saw all they needed and the results were so convincing, there was no need to continue the trial. The stock went from $.34 to $.80 the next day. The P Value is 0.0006 from the trial - over 1000 times better than the P Value necessary to equate this to a "successful" trial. AKA - they knocked it out the park.  
&gt;  
&gt;About 18 months ago, the company conducted a reverse-split (5-1) to get the price over $5 and entice institutions and hedge funds to buy in much heavier. Most funds don't touch stocks unless they are over $5.  
&gt;  
&gt;Right now, it is trading at $5.66, which is $1.15 pre-split. The Market Cap is only $177 million. The market for Hemodialysis catheter locks is over $1 billion. For Oncology and other indications, it brings it to over $5 billion. Many believe the FDA will approve this for all indications, which will be a HUGE deal. I think this company will be bought out by big pharma  
&gt;  
&gt;Some facts and reasons why I think this is so bullish and also gets bought out or enters a substantial partnership:  
&gt;  
&gt;P Value of 0.0006 is so amazing, I cannot overstate how important this data point is to the company and, more importantly, the FDA  
&gt;  
&gt;The company received Priority Review from the FDA and Fast Track status - which puts them basically ahead of the line for the FDA to review  
&gt;  
&gt;The NDA was accepted by the FDA at the end of August  
&gt;  
&gt;The PDUFA Date (date the FDA will decide approval by) is February 28th  
&gt;  
&gt;The product is currently approved and on sale in Europe, but they use an entirely different process for catheter lock solutions and this just does not fit into their model, so it does not sell well there at all - completely different story in the US and I can go into detail on what the differences are and why it is a non-factor here  
&gt;  
&gt;The Board of Directors is filled with people over the age of 70 and they keep buying  
&gt;  
&gt;Their new CFO has zero CFO experience, but experience in banking in Mergers and Acquisitions  
&gt;  
&gt;New member just joined the board, Paulo Casto, and the PR said "We are excited about his experience as CEO of Amylin Pharmaceuticals" - he helped get Amylin bought out for $7 billion. He was the president of 2 other big pharma companies, each worth over $300 billion. He did not join the company for peanuts.  
&gt;  
&gt;Cormedix said they plan to hire a team of 50 sales people to being selling the product - no job listings anywhere and no where to apply - I work in staffing and there is no way they are planning to do this and have it ready by February  
&gt;  
&gt;Upon approval, they have 10.5 years of EXCLUSIVITY - meaning, only they can sell the product. Very attractive to Pfizer, who has the edge on the catheter-lock $5 billion annual market at the moment  
&gt;  
&gt;**I believe this is a huge reason this will be bought out - 10.5 year exclusivity clock starts the DAY DefenCath is approved. Cormedix can't waste time building a sales team - a company like Pfizer or J&amp;J will want to buy this ASAP so they receive the entire 10.5 year time-frame to dominate the market**  
&gt;  
&gt;J M P set a price target of $22 today (9/29/20200  
&gt;  
&gt;Truist Bank set a price target of $20 last week (now $35)  
&gt;  
&gt;The CEO, Khoso Baluch, states on every earnings call that they will "maximize shareholder value" and are always looking to "enter strategic partnerships" - they have indicated they will absolutely be looking for partners to help market Oncology and other indications of the product's market  
&gt;  
&gt;**This is VERY important - they received the right to go after LPAD - which allowed them to end their trial and not conduct another Phase 3 Trial. This is a very new process the FDA has rolled out to help drugs and products that have life-saving capabilities to receive approval through a much more streamlined and faster process. It cuts red tape.** It is not as good as regular approval, because the company will need to have certain info on the labels - think about cigarette packaging with warnings on it etc. It will allow them to sell the drug but not to the extent full approval would most likely allow. **What is important here is this allows Cormedix to receive approval through either the regular means OR through LPAD - basically gives them another shot at approval if the committee is nervous about approving a product that had less trials than a typical product would. But the FDA is really behind the LPAD process and Cormedix is the 2nd company ever to have a shot at receiving it - the FDA wants other companies to go after this and to make it attractive, so it is self-serving of them to approve DefenCath as a good example and case study.**  
&gt;  
&gt;The market is $1 billion for hemodialysis, which is what the trial was done for, but their Chief Medical Officer at Cormedix stated "a catheter is a catheter" when asked if he expects the FDA to just approve for all indications  
&gt;  
&gt;If approved for all indications, **the market goes from $1 billion annually, to over $5 billion.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Institutional Ownership has grown to over 60%!!!!**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Insiders Buying has been very active in the past month and no insider has sold for over 2 years**  
&gt;  
&gt;The ONLY bearish case I believe is a risk is that Elliott Management, who owns a huge chunk of this company, could get it in their heads to take this private with a hostile takeover. I just don't see this happening with all of the other institutional ownership here and at the levels it is at. Obviously, the other bearish case is the drug not receiving approval, with a p value of 0.0006

&amp;#x200B;

The March/June $15c are a somewhat expensive at this point, you can still target them but hope for brokers to bring in $16c-$20c this week if it continues to rise. Get in ASAP

Title: 5 REASONS WHY WE WILL HAVE A STOCK MARKET CORRECTION IN FEBRUARY
 Fellow autists, I have listed below 5 reasons why we will see a market pullback probably in February. I know everything is about $GME at the moment, but this has to do with $GME too. If Melvin Capital has to close its doors, the market will likely see a major pullback due to them reducing long positions etc.  
Have a read below:

* **February is statistically the 2nd worst month in the year**  
Statistically, February is the second worst month for stocks, right after September. Citing historical data dating back to 1928, stocks see an average decline of 0.11% in February, a median return of just 0.27%, and are positive only 52.7% of the time. This indicates that the average sell-off is greater than a market rally, as market gain is slightly more likely. Additionally, the current put/call ratio is signaling a sense of complacency among investors, "[a sign that is typically seen near market tops](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-correction-risk-increasing-resistance-levels-bofa-2021-1-1030000521)", so Bank of America. CFRA's Sam Stovall also notes, that t[he negative trend is more pronounced during a presidents first term in office.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/major-correction-will-surprise-market-speculators-cfras-sam-stovall.html)
* **Fundamentals become increasingly disconnected from price**  
The democratization of stocks has lead many niche stocks higher, giving them a rich valuation in comparison to the broader marker. Overall prices seem more disconnected from Earnings across the board. While forward looking P/E has [declined from a high of 39.95 in Q4 '20 to 25.35 for Q4 '21](https://ycharts.com/indicators/sp_500_pe_ratio_forward_estimate#:~:text=S%26P%20500%20P%2FE%20Ratio%20Forward%20Estimate%20is%20at%20a,36.55%25%20from%20one%20year%20ago.) for the S&amp;P 500, time weighted average of consensus estimates of P/E is still close to ATH, according to [Yardeni Research](https://www.yardeni.com/pub/stockmktperatio.pdf). This is mostly attributed to crazy valuations in the Large Cap sector.
* **Stocks decline on earnings beat**  
Companies that beat earnings and revenue expectations are underperforming the broader market by 50 basis points the day after reporting. This indicates that stocks are ultra sensitive to earnings reports. Multiple earning misses, for example due to a pandemic, could lead to a broader market sell-off.  
* **Goldman's and BoA's indicators are signaling negative sentiment**  
[Bank of America's sell-side indicator stood at 58.4%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/02/01/heres-what-could-spark-the-next-10-market-correction-bank-of-america-warns/?sh=175bf1ff2120) in January, two points away from indicating a "sell" rating for U.S. equities. Similarly, Goldman's risk appetite recently moved above 1, "[a level that has previously preceded slumps](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-goldman-sachs-correction-risk-investors-buy-dip-2021-1-1029981958)". Broadly speaking, investors are underestimating a decline, similar to 2009, according to Goldman. "The market is rising on good news but choosing to largely ignore weaker data and rising infection rates," the team said. "Rapid fund flows and highly correlated risk assets make a correction in the near term increasingly likely." 
* **Multiple similarities to 2000**  
While I am cautious about painting a "doomsday" picture, it is important as a investor to accurately assess risk and study historic events to find present day correlations. Although past performances may not be indicative of future results, it always serves as a great guideline for traders and investors alike. We can assess, that current market conditions are pointing to many similarities to the 2000 tech bubble, which screams bearish sentiment for weeks to come. These were some factors that precedented the market sell off in the 2000 tech bubble and are present in the stock market as of right now.  


*Increased Risk appetite: *   
*Increasing Retail participation: *   
*Valuations disconnected from fundamentals: *  
*Companies underperform following earnings beat * 

&amp;#x200B;

Given the state of the market, the likelihood of a market correction becomes increasingly likely. If a broad-market sell-off will happen, h**ow much will the broader market indices decline?** While this is hard to assess, current market support levels stand at 3,630 and 3,550. representing a 5% and 7% decline from Friday's close. Bank of America analysts predict up to a 13% decline, which happened at the peak of the tech-bubble in 2000. 

 Lastly, **Robinhood will certify in front of congress on February 19th.** If this will lead to any restrictions on market leverage, for retail investors or institutions a like, it would trigger a unprecedented market sell-off. Similar, rising meme-stocks would force the hand of hedge funds and decrease their long-exposure even more, potentially triggering a decline similar to Thursday and Friday.

Title: Two things about GME noone has mentioned yet
Disclaimer: none of the below is investment advice. Do you own research and due diligence. Invest at your own risk. You may lose all your capital. Don't follow my advice.

First, you can see from my post history I've been critical of the GME investment thesis, so I'm not trying to shill it. I have no GME position.

There are a couple of things not mentioned yet in the GME posts:

1. The shorts have not covered yet. Why? Because the majority of the shorts were shorting the stock when it was in the low double-digits. There's no way they would have covered at &gt;$100 unless forced (see Melvin). [Highshortinterest.com](https://Highshortinterest.com) shows GME short interest at 121.07% today.
2. A few shorts may have exited, but just a marginal %, which have been replaced by new shorts at a high entry price. The investment thesis hasn't changed so your approach should not change.
3. Official short interest stats are coming out in a few days (9th feb I think) when we will know what the SI was on 31st Jan. This is super important.
4. Since, as I speculate, the shorts haven't been able to meaningfully cover, the official stats will show that short interest is still way over 100%. This will trigger another massive squeeze.
5. Shorts have up to the 9th feb to cover before a second squeeze. Therefore they will try desperately to drive the price down between now and the 9th. This is critical to understand. I wouldn't be surprised if the stock rallies on the 8th as they try to exit frantically. I mean, what do you think will happen if the world finds out on 2/9 that the short interest is still &gt;100%?
6. MMs buy shares when you buy calls because they always hedge. The same happens when you sell puts. If you like the share and would buy it at $10 you can sell puts at that strike price. You will get a small premium and if the share hits $10 you will have to pay to receive 100 shares at $10 each.  Note: Beware of margin impact if you sell options. Don't find yourself cornered and forced to cover because it can be very expensive. This is strictly for those that have a lot of money in their accounts and don't need/use margin.

Disclaimer: none of the above is investment advice. Do you own research and due diligence. Invest at your own risk. You may lose all your capital. Don't follow my advice.

If I have got something wrong please correct me.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: for those that keep mentioned the shorts entering at $500. You need to remember that the supply of shortable shares in the last two weeks has been minimal to 0. Therefore there can't be many 'new shorts' who got in the last few days. This means that most of the original shorts (who shorted at low prices) are still trapped in. Those who entered recently at high levels don't matter much in the overall % shorted. They are a small amount.

Title: Let's make sure GME is on the SHO list today (2/3) and tomorrow (2/4). If the short selling HF's don't cover after that we complain en masse to the SEC
Aright retards, listen up:

The key thing we don't know right now is what the **real** short interest is sitting at for GME.

But let's give them the benefit of the doubt and say that the S3 numbers are right. The VW squeeze happened with less than half of the current SI GME has. For this squeeze to happen we need big players to start covering.

The SEC (though they do nothing most of the time) is *supposed to* force any HF shorting GME to cover, if we can continue to keep GME on this list for the next two days:

[https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities) (See the other posts recently about this SHO list).

And if they are still there, for 13 consecutive days, and the SEC doesn't do shit (not surprising) we will have to file thousands of complaints to them, call congressmen and senators, etc. to make sure the government steps in and forces them to cover.

Only then can we strap in and enjoy the ride 

**TLDR:**

Either the SEC will do their job and if GME keeps trading anywhere near its current price in two days big players will be forced to cover and the squeeze will (must) happen. Or we complain to the SEC to try and make them enforce their own regulation. ([https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm))

Edit: The only thing we must take into account is that the HFs have probably already seen this coming. This means they might have tried every way possible to get out of it... I'm just not sure how, yet. See this post covering this exact issue but 28 days ago... [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kr98ym/gme\_gang\_we\_need\_to\_complain\_about\_naked\_short/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kr98ym/gme_gang_we_need_to_complain_about_naked_short/)

Title: The Case for US Cannabis Stocks After They Start Soaring from $7.2B USD Big Pharma Acquisition of GW Pharma 
This is huge for this sector imo as this is a massive acquisition by Big Pharma. Although this acquisition is overseas, I think its a sign of what's to come in the US. Here's why I think US cannabis &amp; CBD stocks could have a huge year:

[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cannabis-stocks-rally-anew-as-7-billion-gw-pharma-deal-spurs-interest-in-weed-and-its-medical-benefits-11612376529](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cannabis-stocks-rally-anew-as-7-billion-gw-pharma-deal-spurs-interest-in-weed-and-its-medical-benefits-11612376529)

* **Big Pharma** dropping $7.2B on GW Pharma (They were first to get FDA approval of their CBD drug for seizures) means that big money is shifting into cannabis &amp; CBD plays 
* Democrats have the House, Senate and Presidency as many believe its the US's turn for **legalization** like what we saw in Canada (think of the Green rush of 2017-2018) 
* Rumours on **FDA** further clarifying their rules around CBD and cannabis products in legal states (this would send these stocks flying imo if regulations are loosened or further clarified) 
* Opens up **exporting** to the world for many of these companies if federally cannabis is finally removed as schedule 1 drug 

I made some really good money off of Canadian cannabis companies and I think it will be Nothing in comparison to when the worlds largest economy federally states its open for business

**My Picks** **** **:**

* For Cannabis Focused - $TRUL/$TRULF, $GTII/$GTBIF, $CURA.$CURLF
* For CBD &amp; Wellness - $CWEB/$CWBHF, $CBD.U/$CBDHF

Title: Bull Case, $RKT
Hey retards, Im still in GME but since this isnt a GME only sub heres something for you to look at for additional swings/options or long term boomer shit.

Obligatory  (yes its the fucking name as you know)

Here are some cool bullet points, I dont have pictures for those who cant read. :(

Institutional ownership: ~95% (still near IPO price, they wont sell anytime soon)

RKT has been consolidating for months with a fuck ton of long term investors.

ANECDOTE! I work in the industry and while anyone who does mortgages is up, market share is consistently eaten by the fucking whale that RKT is. Young people people do everything on the internet, and RKT is and has been in the drivers seat with major banks YEARS behind.

SPECULATION! RKT is forming a major partnership and will announce early this year. CEO Jay Farner confirmed this with Jim Cramer late last year. Now, who will the partner be? 

Rumor is that this person is Warren Buffet. He was granted an exemption not to disclose his position with the SEC last quarter as he seeks to build a larger position. He slashed his bank stocks last year, but loves banking/insurance businesses. He has a real estate behemoth and it would make total sense for them and RKT to partner.

 Also, Blackrock has acquired a 7% stake announced yesterday. 

Also, lockup expired yesterday...no one is fucking selling or has sold!

FuNdAmEnTals: P/E ratio is fucking 3.
Best retention rate in the industry (duh), minimal risk in a housing decline as they dont hold their mortgages, they sell them to Fannie/Freddie (backed by the Government).

Sure maybe not a tech valuation but this should be a triple digit stock, if not this year then in the next few. If buffet does get in then this will be $100 pretty quickly.

Looking forward: this company is expected to blow out earnings this month as they continue to gain market share (as they are at least 5 years ahead of major competition), plus they have 2 super bowl ads this weekend.

If you are looking to be a ground floor person and not a chaser this is your opportunity.

TLDR: I buy $RKT, you should buy $RKT, make some tendies, and maybe youll get a blowjob or two from your wife or husband for being smart.

Positions: various 3/19 strikes, LEAPS, and 700 shares

Title: Now is the time to buy Marijuana stocks
Okay everyone I expect to get a lot of hate on this post but Im going for it anyways. 

Yesterday Chuck Schumer went public and said that getting read of the federal prohibition of Marijuana is a top priority this year. Since that comment almost all marijuana stocks/ETFs have MOONED. This is just the beginning. 

Imagine what till happen when this is talked about more let alone goes up for an actual vote. That is why NOW is the time to get in. Before more comments are made, legislation is written and votes are held. Even better is this year it is virtually a sure thing, as Democrats have control both the house, presidency, and the senate. Kamela Harris (our Vice President) was last years lead sponsor of the bill to legalize marijuana until it was shot down by the republican Senate. Surely she will pull her puppet strings on Joe if she needs to. 

A few ETFs I like that are relatively cheap right now: 

MJ- exclusively US-based marijuana holdings 
MSOS- exclusively US-based marijuana holdings 
YOLO-70% US-based marijuana holdings and an amazing fucking ticket symbol

A few individual stocks:
IIPR- a US-based cannabis REIT that Is ALREADY profitable (something rarely seen in the cannabis field 
Canopy growth
Scotts Miracle grow

Investing in these will provide you exposure to all aspects of the marijuana industry in the US (production, cultivation, real estate, medicinal, recreational)


TLDR; Buy marijuana stocks now before legislation is drafted and passed. Call Grammy ask for her Christmas money that she gives you early. When she asks why say you created a fortune-500 rocket ship company and that you will be going to the moon in 6 months. 

THEY ARE GOING TO GO TO THE FUCKING STRATOSPHERE GET ON THE TENDIE TRAIN BEFORE ITS TOO LATE

Title: Weibo DD
A new DD for you apes to consider. I'm still holding some GME, but not sure how that'll work out.

WB is like the Chinese version of twitter. It has a price:sales of 6.9 compared to twitter's 12.7 so it's already undervalued there compared to twitter.  Over the past 5 years, its sales has increased 40% annually compared to Twitter's 20% annually. It's earnings has been growing as well at a rate of 50% annually in 5 years.  It has more active users than twitter at 445 millions active monthly users compared to 330 millions for twitter. China has a population of 1.4 billions so it has room to grow.  China's economy is on the up and up with more and more people getting online. So, WB is a pretty decent growth stock with long term holding potential.

&amp;#x200B;

Interestingly, WB has a very high short interest % of 66% last reported to finviz. Not as crazy as GME was, but pretty high none the less. I believe this has drove the price down from its peak of 140s to 40s currently. This could make it a potential target for a mini short squeeze. And if not, like I said, I think its a good long term holding.

Title: APT is underrated as fuck, here is some DD for you (25% short interest)
Hey retards!

This is for all you guys who bought GME at 300+ expecting it to go to 3k two hours later. Yes, I know youre hurt because GME isnt doing what you want it to do right now, believe me I know how that feels. But let me enlighten you and show you the way. There is actually more than GME and AMC to this market so hold tight and invest now.
APT are currently sitting at about $15 per share, but will be much higher in the coming weeks due to current Covid-19 developments.

**The company**

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/APT?ltr=1

Alpha Pro Tech develops, manufactures and markets disposable protective apparel and building materials in the U.S. as well as internationally. The two segments are Building Supply and Disposable Protective Apparel. The Building Supply segment includes building products such as house wrap and synthetic roof underlayment, as well as other woven materials.

The Disposable Protective Apparel segment includes disposable protective apparel (including shoe covers, caps, coveralls, robes, gowns, and lab coats), face masks, and face shields. Specifically, N-95 respirators are manufactured in the United States. Alpha Pro Tech has developed very strongly in 2020 due to the extremely high demand for N-95 respirators to protect against COVID-19. 

Face masks will have a very different position under President Biden than under Trump, as they are now mandatory to wear in many places.
On his first full day in office, President Biden announced a dozen directives so-called "executive orders," to combat the coronavirus pandemic. These include N95 masks, laboratory equipment, isolation gowns, gloves, swabs, syringes, raw materials for vaccines, and other items. Products such as the U.S.-made N95 masks have priority!

The stock rose from $5 to $25 at the Corona breakout. Then followed the decline to about 11$ (Currently about 15$). Alpha Pro Tech is sitting on cash, has no debt and has started a US$7 million share buyback program.  The market capitalization is 186 million US$. 

**But no short squeeeeeze?**

According to https://www.highshortinterest.com/ the company has a short interest of 24% right now. So, no this is not the next GME, but probably nothing ever will be.
As I think the fundamentals look solid on this one I expect we might see a x5 on APT over the next months

TLDR: Buy APT

Title: BANKERS SCREWING US ON SILVER LIKE RH DID ---&gt;BUY LONG TERM ATM OPTIONS ON SILVER FUTURES ON CASH ACCOUNT ONLY
10 year old account here, you closed minded autists before you downvote this to shit. 

-Spot price demand is through the roof and silver inventories are sold out by end of weekend, yet paper silver has basically wiped 80% of its gains from Friday when the initial idea came out. How?!

-Friday and Sunday futures buyers bumped up the price forcing dealers to increase premium for paper silver 

- Monday everyone and their mother bought inflated premium calls

-Silver inventories sold out meanwhile the bankers have enough silver inventory to cover and hedge since they have earlier deliveries at lower spot prices from previous contracts.  (Someone can explain this better but essentially they are covered with silver future deliveries at lower prices so they don't have to go out like normies and buy inflated silver prices like currently)

-SILVER FUTURES COMMISSION "RAISES MARGINS TO $16500 PER CONTRACT FROM $14000 EFFECTIVE FEB 2ND ACCORDING TO THE EXCHANGE.  THE DECISION IS BASED ON THE NORMAL REVIEW OF MARKET VOLATILITY TO ENSURE ADEQUATE COLLATERAL COVERAGE.   The futures buyers are getting closed out causing downward pressure. 

Tldr; no broker will allow you to buy future silvers on a cash account.  Fuck that.  Just buy a few months out ATM calls on futures options.  You can do this on a cash account.

Title: Don't paper hand GME due to boomer bots. Real sentiment data!
All right retards, we are seeing a lot of bots spreading shit about GME and pushing some other stocks.

I track market sentiment about various stocks using NLP on data from both Reddit and Twitter. After analyzing more than a million comments and tweets the live and long-term sentiment for GME is very positive. Don't be swayed by the bots pushing negative narrative.

Title: Probability of Ryan Cohen buying 7% of GME
Important to read if youre holding GME 



Okay so I personally think that that GME is going to trade relatively sideways until we see another catalyst. The new technology executive announcement is definitely very positive, but doesnt have the same spark as an Elon tweet.

I think, as many of my fellow bag holders are all hoping, that Ryan Cohen exercising his right to purchase 7% of GME will provide the spark we need to get back on track to the 400/500 and beyond range.

So, Ryans a smart guy. I think he recognizes where this company can go and the massive gaming and e sports industry that is only on the rise - its obvious there is strong pricing support at the $90 range.

If $90 is the new floor, which I believe it is, and Ryan Cohen may as well, what is the probability of him exercising this right? 

Id say we have a 50/50 chance that he announces the purchase of these shares this week. I think GameStop is going to piggyback off of their latest executive hire announcement into this, and fully come out as a online/e-commerce transitioning company.

I think that their competitor, EA sports, is going to amplify this need with their latest results . As Dow Jones newswire says today:

The game publishing giant reported late Tuesday a 19% jump in net bookings for the December quarter, driven by digital sales and its live services. The company noted that 62% of its new game sales for the quarter were digital, compared to 49% in last year's holiday period. 

Digital game sales create two problems for GameStop. One, they generally don't move through GameStop stores, with the exception of those driven by cards that the retailer sells. 

TLDR: 50% chance that GME has been quietly lurking and just waiting for the right time to announce with Ryan Cohen. They wanted to wait for all you paper handed b*tches to bounce.






Sincerely, 120 GME @avg 64

Lets say $GME goes up 5% each day, because we all just keep buying little bits with every pay check we get, and keep upwards pressure. (We don't all have 50k laying around)  
At 5% a day it will take about 15 days to double up and about another 15 days for $GME to be on the ATH again!

Title: Bull Case for AMC - DD from a Hollywood Film Producer-Director
\*Not Financial Advice. Entertainment purposes only.   
I work in the film &amp; tv industry in Hollywood. I was bearish on AMC for 2021 because of the pandemic. Our industry pretty much shut down and our local productions, while still going on, are pricey due to the many restrictions and guidelines set forth by our state. 

But recent events with GME made me take a deep dive into the numbers, and well, AMC actually looks pretty good. I nearly forgot that studios like Paramount, Universal, Disney, etc. are bagholding their slate of tentpole movies (movies with budgets well over 200-million) because it doesn't make any sense to stream them.

**Quick Facts:**  
1) AMC received a fresh infusion of cash through the stonks.   
2) And this was after AMC received loans in the north of 100-million.  
**And here's the banger:**  
3) AMC has 2-years worth of tentpole movies from all the major studios waiting for release. This includes Tenet (projected 1.5-billion), Mulan, Wonder Woman, Top Gun 2, Fast and the Furious, Bond, Pixar's Soul, Space Jam and many many more.  A typical year might have three of these. 

This is bad for the studies because their "great" movies now have to compete for market share in a saturated market, but for AMC, it's a great problem to have. It's like having 2 Christmas's in one day. 

**Pent-Up Demand:**  
Box office ticket sales, pre-pandemic, have been around 10-11-billion dollars per year. AMC has the dominant market share and had been generating about 5 to 5.5-billion in revenue (from ticket sales and concessions). 

When Japan re-opened their theaters, Demon Slayer became the number one grossing movie of all time. Pundits believed that the Japanese would've probably watched anything that was released at that point due to pent-up demand. 

If the pent-up demand hypothesis is true, then late 2021 might have the biggest, most profitable quarter ever for AMC, and 2022 will be even bigger. Forward guidance reported in any 2021 quarter's earnings will foster great optimism, and due to secular factors and the fed's push for lower interest rates, we might see some of the best numbers 

**Another possibility:**  
If Japan cancels the Olympics (likely), that opens up another 2-3-month window of time for studios to schedule their releases. For example, instead of Wonder Woman competing for August's 1-billion market share with Pixar's Soul, Soul could release in August, and Wonder Woman could release in October, etc. This means more efficient releases and more dinero for AMC. 

TL;DR - Pent-up demand, likely near-term re-opening due to vaccines, the fact that major film studios are bag-holding tentpole movies and will do whatever it takes to release them to the market when AMC still has the lead market share of theatrical ticket sales makes me MEGA bullish on AMC.

Title: Feeling bullish on $CNC, Healthcare dip due to covid results, ACA SEP on the 15th
Not nearly enough DD, but from what I am seeing, 

$CNC is one of the largest ACA and public health player and also is the first major public health on the ER Calendar for next Tuesday. Beta is 1.08 and marketwatch low target is 16% higher that todays price.

The dip this month is being attributed to Q4 covid utilization and unfavorable vaccine distribution, but:

 (1) here is going to be an ACA SEP from feb15 through early summer

(2) Biden admin increased subsidies on silver ACA plans to the point where many members are going to have zero premiums which should not only increase enrollment during the SEP but also decrease attrition rates throughout the year

(3) Economic downturns boost medicaid enrollment

Here's my DD on Cassava Sciences, a biopharmaceutical company developing Sumifilam, a new Alzheimers drug.

**TLDR: CASSAVA Sciences got 68% of its operating costs paid in grants by the NIH in order to fund a groundbreaking Alzheimer's drug that's about to get fast-tracked to market to treat all of our dementia-riddled grandparents. SAVA gets a $286 price target assuming phase 3 success and my autistic math says that gives a $186 current fair value.**

A few days ago, this article got published on Seeking Alpha:

&gt;**4 Reasons Cassava Sciences Could Be The Best-Performing Stock Of 2021**

Theres a lot of good info in this that we dont have time to get into but Ill focus in on one key point the author makes:

&gt;**Simufilam is a Shoo-In for Breakthrough Therapy Designation**

Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) means it will be accelerated through phase 3 trials to market *40% faster* than non breakthrough drugs.

If Simufilam gets BTD, this is what will happen to the stock price:

[Immunomedics gets BTD on Trodelvy in 2\/5\/16](https://preview.redd.it/exy4vyadtaf61.png?width=1872&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d70aa788c46f54f29bd51d4027c4eb22fb87f99)

Lets zoom out a little bit:

[Immunomedics Acquired In $21B  Deal ](https://preview.redd.it/mplmcot7taf61.png?width=1840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ef980e1c472c0725134d42201fdc9f7661afd93)

***What are some good indicators Sumifilam will get Breakthrough Therapy Designation?***

According to the FDA:

&gt;A Breakthrough Therapy is a drug:  
&gt;  
&gt;intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and  
&gt;  
&gt;preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development

Sumifilam satisfies both of these requirements and you can bet your autistic ass that our octogenarian politicians are pushing for this type of groundbreaking Alzheimer drug research to receive virtually unlimited funding and a regulatory pass.

Cassava Sciences received government research grants totaled $1.8 million in 2017, $3.0 million in 2018, $4.7 million in 2019, and $3.4 million the first three quarters of 2020. ***$3.4 million.*** That means that the US government paid for **68%** of the operating costs of this company 2020. This is even more indication that Sumifilam will get the green light from the FDA when it comes to BTD.

***What's a reasonable price target on SAVA?***

A quick google search reveals 60-70% success rate on phase 3 trials. If we assume the author of this article is correct about his **$286** price target after successful phase 3 trial, we have to give SAVA a **$186** target based on EV. (Disclaimer: I am in no way qualified to give anything a price target)

If you have any more questions please read the fucking article, it's too long for me to finish.

Positions:

885 SAVA, 14 SAVA $15c 2/19, 3 SAVA $15c 3/19

Title: DD $GOEV / Canoo's potential AAPL Partnership with a side of short squeeze 
First I want to congratulate us on breaking 8 million degenerates. I have been posting on this sub for over 3 years back when we were at only a couple hundred thousand. This is my first DD write up and Im a little retarded so please go easy on me. 

For everyone who doesnt want to read a wall of text theres a **TL:DR** at the bottom.

**Technical Setup:**

Canoo has completed its SPAC merger and ticker change a little over a month ago going from HCAC to GOEV. Ever since the combination it has been piled into by shorts. The short position has grown exponentially from 99k shares to over 10 million as of the last update by NASDAQ. I subscribe to S3 Capitals retail short algorithm which gives a more accurate current estimate of ~11 million shares short. New available shorts are nearly nonexistent and borrow rates are sky rocketing. If you havent been living under a rock the past couple of weeks you already know how well short squeezes can play out. 

[S3 short Info](https://imgur.com/RPVpzbu)

[NASDAQ Short Info](https://imgur.com/LrjJJCD)

[Share Borrow &amp; Fees](https://imgur.com/esZFBfL)

**Fundamental Setup:**

GOEV has a ton of positive catalyst the shorts are overlooking and I believe this will lead to large losses on their side. For one, the EV revolution is here to stay as you can tell from the new administration. Biden plans to electrify the whole federal fleet (estimated 650k vehicles). GOEV  has the perfect mid sized commercial B2B purpose built vehicle which fits the build of many government vehicles. The Canoo purpose built vehicle can replace for example USPS mail trucks.

[MPDV Purpose Built Vehicle](https://www.canoo.com/mpdv/) 

Canoos leadership are veterans in the automotive industry which is hard to say for some of the other SPAC *cough * NKLA. Canoo's co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was CTO at EV carmaker Faraday Future and more importantly has over 30 years of management experience at BMW. He worked to reimagine the MINI brand, develop the company's first SUV, and the iProject (BMW i8 &amp; i3). They also poached talent from Tesla; Sohel Merchant (vehicle architecture) Christoph Kuttner (vehicle trim), and Alexi Charbonneau (proprietary EV skateboard tech) just to name a few. 

The real value here is their proprietary B2B skateboard platform for EVs. Allowing for any automaker to design and build their perfect sedan and just clip on to an already existing powertrain. Now AAPL is most likely going to sign an EV production contract with Hyundai/KIA (expected as soon as Feb 17th) confirmed last night by the  3.6 Billion investment. GOEV is already providing their platform to Hyundai/KIA. GOEV has already been validated by AAPL as in AAPL wanted to buy them out in 2020 so clearly they like their tech. And if you think thats not enough to sell you on this theory then listen to this: In 2015, Apple almost used the BMW i3 as the basis for its Apple Car the two founders of Canoo were the top guys on the iProject. It doesnt take a genius to connect these dots.

Title: $CRSR Corsair DD - The Q4 results are basically already out and nobody is talking about it!
While the whole world was having a big old party, a few outsiders and weirdos saw what no one else could. [] These outsiders saw the giant lie at the heart of the economy, and they saw it by doing something the rest of the suckers never thought to do: They looked. (Big Short)
  
I have seen many good quality DD about Corsair. We all know its a great business.
  
What I want to focus on is the financials. More specifically: We already know Q4 results and nobody is talking about it! Why? Because nobody looked!!!
  
Corsair recently posted a prospectus related to the sale of 7.5M shares by some insiders (totally normal as its mostly the private equity owner  EagleTree - selling a small bit and passing from 78.32% to 68.55% ownership - they sold 7,135,000 out of the 7,500,000 sold Its totally fair for the PE owner to cash out a bit).
  
Heres the prospectus (dated 21st of January 2021): https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/22acfc88-2f42-4b16-8bbb-099323323f33

1) Now, check out page 9 of the document
  
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we expect:
  
 Net revenue to be between approximately $1,700 million and $1,701 million
  
 Net income to be between approximately $101 million and $103 million
  
 Adjusted EBITDA to be between approximately $211 and $213 million
  
Yes, we already know they have beaten their own updated estimates
  
In fact, the company initially estimated the following (from Q3 release https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d)
  
For the full year 2020, we currently expect:
  
 Net revenue to be in the range of $1,616 million to $1,631 million.
  
 Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $178 million to $184 million.
  
 Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $187 million to $193 million.Then, they updated the guidance on November 30th 2020 (https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-updates-full-year-2020-outlook):
  
For the full year 2020, we currently expect:
  
 Net revenue to be in the range of $1,651 million to $1,666 million.
 Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $186 million to $192 million.
 Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $194 million to $200 million.
  
So they have beaten their own initial and revisited estimates. Great!! Really great!!
  
2) But thats not all we can easily infer from the Prospectus dated January 21, 2021 (Again we just need to look).
  
As they mention on the Q3 report, as of September 30, 2020, we had cash and restricted cash of $120.1 million, $48.0 million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of $370.1 million.In the more recent prospectus (page 10):
  
In addition to the foregoing, as of December 31, 2020, we expect to have approximately $133 million in cash and restricted cash and we expect to have net debt of approximately $194 million following the repayment of $50.0 million in existing debt with cash on hand during the quarter ended December 31, 2020.
  
This means that they have reduced net debt from $250M ($370 - $120 of cash) to $194M, which implies $56M of free cash flow generated during the quarter. As a reminder, they generated around 21M FCF in q3 2020 and 94M in the first 9 months of 2020. So this implies around 150M FCF in 2020 (as a reference in the first 9 months of 2019, they had negative FCF of about 6M).
  
(check cash flow statement at page 14 on the Q3 report here https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d)
  
At $39, Corsair has a 3.5Bn market cap (91.92M of shares outstanding).
  
This is a very respectable cash flow yield of 4.2%. Id be expecting a much lower yield from a company growing as fast as Corsair is (60.7% growth year-over-year in Q3 and, assuming sales of 554M for Q4 vs 327M for Q4 2019, a growth of 69.4% in Q4).Now, you must be thinking: but the smart money already knows this! They have accounted for it!
  
I used to be like you I used to think the market was efficient and that big funds and banks were always looking carefully at things!
  
No f*** way!!!
  
Take a look at Goldman Sachs research from February 1st 2021 (yes, after the prospectus was published).
  
Someone shared it on reddit

Title: Fuck the squeeze, I'm in it for the long qual.
 

I know I may get downvoted for this... but at this point honestly **fuck the squeeze.**

This could be a lifelong hold into some serious generational wealth. I'm in it for the qualitative now.

**For all you retards who cant read and are just  ... = **

Look at whats happened today alone...

Matt Francis, new GameStop Chief Tech Officer formerly from AWS, lead engineer. Think about that for sec... The guy who is responsible for Amazon's web services. Amazon IS fucking web services, well, it's also fulfilment of course. This is still retail were talking about.

Josh Krueger, new GameStop VP of Fulfillment formerly from Amazon, Walmart, QVC. I shouldn't need to tell you why this is a big move. Looks like the guy has literally been growing in the same exact fucking direction as the industry. Next in line for him, Gamestop

Kelli **MF** Durkin, new GameStop Sr VP of Customer Care, previously from CHEWY. Everything people love about Chewy that made it such a lovable brand comes from their customer service dpt. They'll leave the UXUI up to Matt and his team while Kellis team keeps on making the customers come back to buy more. Dont underestimate the power of good customer service. Ive straight up switched ISPs because of this.

Now, combine this dream team, with the (un)expected possibility of Ryan Cohen becoming CEO. This really is some Avengers End Game shit.

This fucking super team could really turn GameStop into the one-stop-game-shop everything gaming related. Im talking build-a-pc centers with the next-gen GPUs/CPUs hitting exclusively GME first (re: fulfillment), online streaming community (aka Twitch/Amazon), sharing revenue on cloud-based game streaming platforms (like MSFT GamePass), combined with a dedication to their customer. **Thats fucking YOU, YOU RETARD!**

Okay, now for a very light amount of quantitative speculation. Imagine holding your current amount of shares, the stock eventually hits $400 and it splits 8:1. Now, with 8x more shares you slowly climb up to $1000. Maybe it splits again along the way, who fucking knows, you do the math. Yeah its that same hypothetical math youve been doing the past week only... 1x your current share amount. Kinda makes you want to get more shares.

Obligatory, I am most certainly a retard, so this is not advice so please dont listen to me. Only a fool on a rant.

Title: NOK DD for the few remaining retards who actually like making money
I know you retards have brains so smooth you'd be able to see your own reflection if it weren't for the massive dents in your heads, but get together for a group reading session because I'm going to summarize as succinctly as possible in four key points why you should be looking at NOK as your next play :



**(1)** No, they don't do phones anymore, that part of their business was licensed out. Their main focus now is being incredibly well-positioned as a major player in the emerging 5G infrastructure game, and have been dumping billions into R&amp;D building themselves up to this point. With the western world wanting Chinese companies (Huawei, ZTE) out due to national security concerns, they are set up as one of two major players to scoop up a large portion of the market share in the US and Europe as the 5G rollout snowballs harder and harder in the coming years. Plus, they have over 3000 patents that basically fortify their position in this regard.


**(2)** They have recently replaced their CEO with a certified asskicker named Pekka Lundmark who has a consistent record of happy shareholders and success within global business-to-business technology companies. The man even worked for Nokia back in their heyday before leaving to go chalk up some more wins, and now he is back to make Nokia a global powerhouse once more.


**(3)** Everyone complaining about the size of float is a  of the same variety that said that GME would never stay above $12 a couple months ago. Just last week NOK spiked hard on volume before getting kicked in the nuts as a collateral damage from brokerages neutering GME and co. For now the crayon munchers of the trading world brainlessly associate NOK with the squeeze plays because they saw it and WSB in the same sentence, but once that fog clears and the collective room temperature IQ of the broader market finally processes that NOK is actually a solid play, interest will drive volume into a cascading repeat of what started to happen last week.


**(4)** Nokia is currently discounted when measured up against pretty much any comparable company on a P/E basis. This is likely due to pessimism surrounding recent trends in their financials, but that is what happens when you make temporary cuts to hone your business into a laser-focused money printer for the singular purpose of domination in the wireless infrastructure sector. The boomer bean-counters don't seem to understand that plowing money into R&amp;D and restructuring a business into a lean, mean, 5G machine = long term growth, which this market has shown itself to reward generously and this will likely begin to price in sooner rather than later. (Hence why now is the time to take the boomers' shares from them at boomer prices and get your one-way ticket to the moon before the rest of the glue eaters realize what is happening and buy at the top as they so like to do).

**Bonus Point:** Nokia is literally putting 4G on the moon. If this isn't a sign for you I don't know what is. 



**Positions:** Long 18,133 shares. [Proof](https://i.ibb.co/0BsY4bk/2-FD25586-4-A88-4-EF2-8-EB5-77-F665293-F09.jpg)

Title: ZNGA earnings report to be released February 10th
A few quick facts about Zynga:

* 2019 saw a 45% revenue growth over 2018, and based on the first three quarters of 2020, they are on track to again have 45% year-over -ear (YoY) revenue growth. 
* YoY earnings-per-share growth at the end of 2018 was 88%, 2019 was 52%, and 2020 is shaping up to be about 42%. 
* Share price over the last few years has been increasing in tandem with the above mentioned growth. 
* The mobile gaming industry is growing at a truly remarkable rate. And given the less social interaction that the pandemic has forced upon the world, it only goes to reason that more people are spending time entertaining themselves on their phones. 
* The 2020 earnings release is next week Wednesday (Feb. 10th). 

Do your own due diligence, but I like this company and their aggressive growth strategies.

Title: CVAC is the next vaccine stock
These dudes have an MRNA covid vaccine in phase three trials in Europe and elsewhere. 

Pfizer and Moderna have already proven the efficacy and safety of this class of vaccines that seem to be superior to adenovirus based vaccines.  

CVACs vaccine can be stored for months in a regular fridge unlike the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines which require freezers and ultra-cold freezers respectively. 

Their gen1 vaccine provoked good T cell and B cell responses in non-human primates. 

CVAC just signed a production deal with Bayer and a partnership with GSK to test a multivalent vaccine against emerging spike variants

All vaccine stonks spike after release of phase 3 results and CVAC expects phase three results this quarter.

Title: Millionaire Playbook: Bionano Genomics $BNGO
To any and all monkeys,
Follow the bananas and invest in the company thats on the way to curing cancer. Bionano Genomics $BNGO, has recently been showing off the capabilities of their new Saphyr optical genome mapping (OGM) technology. Make no mistake, no other company provides this level of detail and insight. They have proven that they are able to look at individual DNA molecules to determine whether or not it is cancerous within 1% of certainty.

This stock has substantial short interest manipulating that price down for what I would assume to be a large institutional entry. I have a triple digit price target in mind within 2-3 years. Join the wave

Title: GME Victory Conditions for Hedge Funds vs. the Unwashed Masses: Actual DD (double down)
I think we should discuss how either side of the trade wins.

We all know about short interest, possible short ladder attacks, low volume, and all that. But there is an argument I read yet: the further the price goes down, the more difficult it is to actually push it lower. 

If these funds swapping around shares is the primary driver of the collapse in price, then they will confront a prisoner's dilemma-type situation. Seeing the possibility of the largest bomb in financial history detonating, each financial firm that has gone short knows full well that others want to cut their losses, lick their wounds, and fight another day. As we know if one firm closes some of their shorts, the demand, and the price increase. But the bomb is still there looming in the background. 

The worst-case scenario for holders of GME is the steady unloading of shorts over a long period of time, where the de-loading process is less expensive than the margin interest that these firms have to pay to keep their shares. So, think the price of GME remaining steady at like $20 or $30 for months-- an acceptable loss for hedge funds. To do this, almost every short fund would have to agree to collaborate in near-perfect harmony. And, as we know, that is nearly impossible.

It's going to take a really long time for us to go back to $17-- this is just not possible in the short run. To make matters worse for the firms, the short interest increased to around 212%. The bomb has only grown more dangerous. As long as this is the case, you should hold. Months can feel like years, but if we are resilient and GME actually does decently as a company, these short positions are going to bleed out. I just don't see how unwinding these positions is probable when a single closed position could set off the bomb. 

But then again, I don't know how to read. And, yes I'd like a large soda with that. GME to the moooooooonnnn  [](https://unicode-table.com/en/1F680/)[](https://unicode-table.com/en/1F680/)[](https://unicode-table.com/en/1F680/)[](https://unicode-table.com/en/1F680/)[](https://unicode-table.com/en/1F680/)[](https://unicode-table.com/en/1F680/)[](https://unicode-table.com/en/1F680/)[](https://unicode-table.com/en/1F680/)

Title: IFF Update Feb 3  Still plenty of time to get aboard
Hey you guys - Sloth

Just wanted to give you an update on the IFF Short and gamma squeeze opportunity I brought to WSB on Monday. 

It is great news! The cost to borrow shares continues rocket upwards (44.7%), and they continue to use borrowed shares to try and keep down the price.

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/IFF

As you can see, the drop at end of day was driven by the shorts selling 15,000 shares. Which doesn't sound like alot, but it is HUGE for such a low volume stock, with low IVs.

Options are little changed:

There is a good options ladder this week (at $135 and $150), and there is a monstrous option gamma squeeze at $150 for Feb 19.

This is also a very valuable company, which will see significant growth in their price to sales multiple, now that their acquisition of DuPont Nutrition &amp; Biosciences is complete.

Here is the Ortex data for yesterday. For some reason I am not able to upload a new screenshot, but it is little changed (just those new shares sold short). 
The current number of borrowed (short) shares is at 61.99m:
https://imgur.com/gallery/sEIUmWb

And yes, I own a position in this stock. This is not investment advice, and all that other stuff. Do your own DD, and please, tell me why I am wrong.

Here are my pros and cons for it overall (on Mobile):
Pros: 
1 - Completed merger with Dupont Nutrition and Biosciences. One of the big advantages of this merger is it allows IFF to offer full spectrum product development, with an excellent focus on Plant based nutrition. (without disclosing too much, plant based nutrition was the only segment to grow very well during the pandemic, and now tastes as good, or better than dairy based nutrition, so it is set to explode in the USA.)

2 - Consistent dividend growth. IFF tripled their dividends over 10 years. See above for my expectations for further growth in income. And looking back, they have been increasing their dividend since the 90s.

3 - IFF has traded sideways for years, all the while increasing earnings / decreasing their multiples. They are an ignored, low volatility stock.

4 - There is excessive short interest, as far as I can tell (iborrowdesk.com and Ortex). To me, that means there is good short term upside potential.

5 - ~25% of the outstanding stock is owned by the TetraPak family holding company. They are insiders in this industry, and clearly know who their customers are using to flavor the drinks going into TetraPaks.

6 - The flavor industry is technically complex, and there is very limited competition. And IFF has something like 3000 patents (serious, it is crazy complex, scientist with crazy hair level of technical complexity.)

7 - Their dividend percent is about a percent above the industry standard (~2.5% vs 1.5%).

Cons:

1 - I don't know how well the merger will work.

2 - There are alot of shares coming "soon", but should still trade around the same value.

I already own 100 shares, and bought 200 Feb 19 $150 calls (because, wow, there was something like 160,000 open interest at that time point. Someone must know something, right?)

Title: WallStreet (like for real) cant read, so we shall have tendies.
This sub is dying as the mods are purged. 

Title: NVMI: a hidden gem with great upside potential
Mandatory pledge of allegiance to GME: I was in GME before it was cool. Did both [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4cpbf/calculating_what_the_gme_price_should_be_for/) and [memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ktb2ms/gme_ryan_cohen_short_squeeze/).

Now back to the issue at hand:

A while back while reading the comments on an $NNDM DD in here, I came across a guy who said $NVMI is even better than NNDM but he's not going to write a DD on it or promote it any other way on WSB. Since I like forbidden fruits, I went ahead and did my own research on the company. I'm sharing the results with you:

Nova Measuring Instruments is an Israel-based company (with 18 offices worldwide) that provides metrology solutions (devices and software) for advanced process control used in semiconductor manufacturing.

Metrology means measuring, and in this context, super precise measuring (nanometer or smaller) required for semiconductor manufacturing. The company's metrology solutions use technologies including Optical Scatterometry, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), x-ray fluorescence (XRF), scatterometry modeling software, and high-performance computing. The company holds 30 patents in this field.

Market cap: \~2.2 Billion

P/E ratio: \~42

Has beaten earning expectations in the past 4 quarters (didn't check further back)

The stock price has grown almost 100% in the last year, which is good but nothing compared to NNDM, for instance, which has grown 540%.

Daily volume is low (about 150,000)

In a recent (Jan 28, 2021) [press release](https://www.novami.com/investors/press-releases/nova-receives-multiple-materials-metrology-orders-from-leading-logic-and-foundry-customers/), the company announced that it "received multiple orders from multiple leading Logic and Foundry customers for its most advanced materials metrology solutions."  They don't name the new clients, but could one of them be $TSM?

Anyway, we know that all sorts of trendy technologies such as EVs, AI, Cloud, etc. need processors and memory devices, which brings our attention to companies such as $AMD, $INTC, $ON, and $TSM. But these companies in turn need precise measuring devices for their process control, and NVMI is the leader in that area.

The company's technology/patents can also be useful in 3D printers that print precise things (again, such as NNDM).

I did a quick search and it seems no one has done a DD on this in WSB. I think it has great growth potential both short term and long term. Once WB is over the BANG stocks, this is something worth a look at. IMO, it will be similar to stocks like MGNI and SE that consistently move up without much buzz around them on WSB.

&amp;#x200B;

Technicals:

I don't know much about technicals but according to tradingview, it's neutral based on oscillators, and strong buy based on moving averages.

&amp;#x200B;

My positions:Stocks80C 5/21/2021

The options market for this stock is low volume and there are large gaps between bid/ask prices, so I suggest going with the stocks.

Title: Closer look at $XL
Okay guys, I know you just want to know the short interest as the trend goes so I'mma just get it out of the way: **it stands at approx. 70% of share float, have a look: (**[**https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=XL**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=XL)**)**

However I wanna have a closer look at the company itself and why it could be a good investment for short/medium term gains, because that's why we are playing this game called stock market.

XL Fleet ($XL) transforms existing commercial vehicles, e.g. small trucks into electric vehicles. Unlike many SPACs, they have an actual product that is already battle tested, and yes, it has also produced revenue. Revenue, that is set to increased **exponentially** as mentioned below. Now here are couple of interesting points that made me a believer:

* $350m in cash with NO material debt
* Run by MIT alumnis with CEO's impressive records at McKinsey, GM
* Jon Ledecky as board member - he's the majority owner at NY Islanders and the company he founded in the 90's was the fastest entrant to Fortune 500
* Two analyst recently began coverage with $30 PT. Current share price as of 31.1. is $18.98
* 2024 revenue forecast is $1.377 billion; current market cap $2.493B ! -&gt; company says accessible market is 1 trillion $
* EBITDA positive results projected for 2022
* All government vehicles to be turned electric - XL has the fastest solution to this and they've already known to have collaborated with public institutions
* Other customers include e.g. Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Verizon, DHL
* PIPE shares that were unleashed in the market recently created lot of downward pressure for the stock - that should be over soon
* Hyped by Cramer, gave a lot of Mad Money air time going through their business case

Price targets and analyst coverages:

* BTIG initiated analyst coverage with $30 PT:[https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3231730&amp;headline=XL-XL-Fleet-initiated-with-a-Buy-at-BTIG](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3231730&amp;headline=XL-XL-Fleet-initiated-with-a-Buy-at-BTIG)  

* Canaccord sees XL Fleet going to $30 per share due to 'first mover' advantage:[https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3237228&amp;headline=XL-Canaccord-sees-XL-Fleet-going-to--per-share-on-firstmover-advantage](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3237228&amp;headline=XL-Canaccord-sees-XL-Fleet-going-to--per-share-on-firstmover-advantage)  


This is not an investment advice and I recommend you all do your DD. All kinds of discussion is very welcomed, thanks am out.

EDIT: GME to the moon with diamond hands. However this should be an interesting play moving forward so keep an eye on my boys at $XL whether it's before or after GME saga is over

Edit 2: I recommend you all check the backgrounds of CEO Dimitri Kazarinoff, founder Tod Hynes and board member Jon Ledecky. These are some smart motherfuckers you wanna have on your side when growing a business in this sector

Title: SSYS - Stratasys flying under the radar
Oraight, time for some deep dive.

You all heard about that Kathie Wood, sister to Tiger Woods and Woodie Woodpecker. ARKK (her investment firm), identified TSLA early as a potentially exponential company. Ever since the TSLA stock split, I have been going through ARKKs ETF exposure and been looking into further firms that have an angle.

I have been looking into three areas of ARKK:

* EV
* Genomics
* Technological Advancements

While the first two are clear and there should be some exposure to it in your portfolios or bets, I was specifically interested in the third category.

**Introducing Stratasys SSYS**

The company has quite a solid foundation. It is one of the leading 3D-printing companies. Makerbot? The biggest brand in 3D Printing? Yep, Stratasys. I come from a background where 3D printing has become the absolute industry standard and we are going to see it becoming the standard in mass manufacture, too. I am speaking metal and carbon 3d-printing. Let me tell you, carbon printing is already better than part molding and every company on earth is starting to use it. I am talking car manufacturers, shipyards, small-scale prototypers, the cycling industry, the airplane industry, everyone. With SSYS you aren't jumping on a company that sells shovels during the gold rush. Your jumping on the company that gives everyone the chance to build their own damn shovel. Taking the bet on SSYS is not a "Next Friday" moment, you are rather looking into a growth over time chance. The beauty of this badger is: the current evaluation is under 3 billion.

The sad thing? You are too late. It is trading ~~near the ATH~~ at the highest level of the last 5 years. But hear me out, the real kicker is if you look at the charts. After the last earnings, there wasn't much movement. But then, during the overexposre of ARKK through TSLAs growth, someone has been buying in tranches day after day for nearly 2 months now. My theory is, institutional investors are starting to copy ARKKs investment strategy, loading up on different companies ARKK has been invested in. So yes this baby will fly higher because as far as I see it, there hasn't been much exposure to the retail world yet.

&amp;#x200B;

[Ever since november its been a straight ramp up](https://preview.redd.it/5ubqsnoby9f61.png?width=1892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94786daf76ba06ce57ddba65cc7e3912e53d56d6)

Why it will go up:

* Solid economics (200+k revenue per employee)
* Overall growth in the next 2Y will continue
* Exposure to exponential growth potential in 3D printing
* Low overall market cap (sub 3bn)
* Linear purchases over the last 2 months, seemingly larger investor with stepped investing strategy
* Not speculative: They have products, they are generating revenue, the fundamentals are working
* Perfectly in place at the right time
* No high volatility, IV is superfine if you are into calls
* Connected to other hypes: 3D Printing for EVs, Medical, and others.
* Covid situation independent, except for 3rd world war scenarios

The risks:

* ~~Trading too ATH, triggering additional capitalisation~~ (See edit, its trading its highest in the last 5Y but about 1/3 of its ATH. The risk therefore is more something like: 5 Year High could trigger additional capitalisation)
* Competition getting too good, driving revenue down (unlikely)
* Some early investor dropping out
* ARKK reducing their exposure or killing of SSYS publicly

**Edit:** Thanks to /u/YahyaJ - SSYS is nowhere near its ATH. ATH was at 136, were now at 49.

**Where I see it flying**

I think SSYS is going to steadily grow more and more accelerated. This steady growth will not stay under the radar, especially not when retail starts to look at the different investments ARKK is exposed to. I think within the next three months it will add another 30-40% through institutional investors and ETFs cloning ARKK. If you look at their exposure chart, ARKK even had to reduce their amount of SSYS for it to stabilise it's % in the ETF: [https://cathiesark.com/arkk-holdings-of-ssys](https://cathiesark.com/arkk-holdings-of-ssys). This runup has been to mechanical to ignore, inspite of it trading to ~~ATH~~ the highest level of the last 5 years.

I don't think its ready for a retail investor runup, aka: its not going to pop. But it is going to steadily climb, which should give a nice return on calls and stock. If it goes down in value (which it did during the covid dip), it will still be a valuable company that will one day pop off. There is no real bagholding exposure at this price level. You are investing in a technology that **will** rule the world and in a company that is ready to take the scepter. Options are a significant risk though.

**The rest**

I do not yet have a position, except for a few stocks I bought to track the stock (lul) and they made about 120% since november (damn). I will take a bigger one soon and will post my update here.

For options: Watch. the. spread!

Whats the WSB take?

**EDIT for Transparency:** Started taking some bigger exposure and bought 6 calls 50 March 5, will take more as soon as funds come back to settled cash from the clearinghouse

Title: GameStop ($GME) hires new c-suite and executive talents (2/3/21)
GameStop issued a [press release](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-appoints-chief-technology-officer) today.

They've hired a new CTO, who is a former AWS Engineering lead and held senior positions at QVC and Zulily.  He will oversee new ecommerce engineering and operations.

They've hired a new VP of Fulfillment who previously worked at Amazon, Walmart and QVC.

Lastly, they've hired a new VP of Customer Care, who previously worked at Chewy.  Customer Care was always Chewy's angle at being successful overall, and it's good to see that customer care talent being incorporated into the new GameStop.

This looks to be the start of the whole new ecommerce strategy.

Title: CRSR Is The Play Before 2/9 Earnings
Positions: Long my entire IRA in CRSR $45 2/19 calls; Short $35 2/19 puts for my entire Roth IRA. (Fuck taxes we scheming here)

Corsair is poised to have its biggest quarter ever. How do I know? Check MSFT and LOGI earnings. MSFT sold out of every xbox it had. That is absolutely ridiculous. Corsair has rolled out new products, and every neckbeard in this sub is buying their PC cooling systems.

Last quarter, CRSR doubled expected EPS amidst a run from $20-$51. CRSR has been consolidating for months between mid 30s and low 40s, with a break out last week touching $50 before the market slide. They priced a secondary offering from an insider lock up at $35, providing a strong floor (thus my short puts at $35. Shout out theta gang.) 80% of the float is locked up til March, short interest is fairly high, and Corsair should have its best quarter ever. 

Finally, the technicals. Pull up the chart, consolidating tighter and tighter everyday for weeks. Its about to explode. Dont miss the big play this week.

Title: THE $2,000 SPCE CASE - PRE-REVENUE = UNLIMITED OPPORTUNITIES

Title: The short ratio as % of total volume has remained high. They likely haven't been covering the last 5 trading days.
I went back over the past month of short sales data and you can see that GME is still being shorted at fairly healthy levels. Anything over 50% in short ratio means they couldn't have covered overall for the day because a majority of the trades were shorts (math, people). Also, this data is showing only **short** sale data; it doesn't include regular share sales.

If someone could overlay this with the volume / price chart, it'd be helpful to see what that looks like.

Source: [FINRA SHO Daily Short Volume](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html). It takes samples of short sale data from different markets, so you won't see the same total volume numbers, but the ratio (%) should be the same across all markets (statistics, people). This is different from short interest (a bi-monthly reported figure) but this is a good daily representation of the number of short trades.

Over the past few days, the level of hedge fund short interest in GameStop fell sharply. Or did it?

On the evening of Monday, Feb. 1, Bloomberg reported that GameStop Short Interest Plunges in Sign Traders Are Covering.

Two separate research firms, IHS Markit and S3 Partners, reported the drop:

Short interest in the video-game retailer plummeted to 39% of free-floating shares, from 114% in mid-January, according to IHS Markit Ltd. data. Data from S3 Partners, another market intelligence firm, showed a similar pattern, with GameStops short sales having fallen to about 50% of its total stock available to trade, down from a high of roughly 140% reached earlier this year.

The reporting coincided with a big drop in the value of GME shares. This is clear evidence that the hedge funds are winning, and that the Reddit army is losing.

Unless the short interest data is being manipulated, which is also a real possibility.

If the U.S. Congress does any real digging when it holds hearings on the GameStop situation, it will uncover some very interesting quirks of the market, many of them revolving around shorting practices.

Most people understand naked shorting to be an illegal thing, and it is  sort of.

On the other hand, there are plenty of instances where naked shorting is more of a gray area  not so much a violation of the law as a minor infraction worthy of a parking ticket  and other instances where certain players can short a stock beyond 100% of the float, or short nakedly, in a wholly legal way.

This is where the reported sharp decline in GameStop (GME) short interest gets intriguing.

There are at least two plausible explanations for GME short interest declining  giving the appearance of hedge funds covering more than half their shorts  even as the GME share price fell sharply alongside.

The first explanation is that GME squeezers lost their discipline and broke ranks.

If a critical mass of holders on the long side of GME started selling to realize profit in GME, that would have given the hedge funds an opportunity to cover their shorts  via buying back their shares  at progressively lower levels as the share price fell.

Plummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words, could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out.

The notion that the squeezers broke ranks, and that the hedge funds are winning, is certainly the perception that was created. The Bloomberg article strongly suggested that the Reddit army has lost.

Short squeezes can only last as long as there is a large short position in a stock, the chief market strategist at Miller Tabak &amp; Co. told Bloomberg. Once that dissipates, the situation changes completely.

But there is another possibility, which is that the hedge fund short interest in GME didnt really dissipate.

If the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time.

That is because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions. 

In this second scenario, though, the hedge funds that are short  with tens of billions of dollars on the line  could have decided to play a high-stakes trick.

The trick would be: Make it look like weve covered our shorts when we really havent (because we cant), so that short interest falls and the Reddit army gets demoralized, thus breaking the squeeze.

The way the hedge funds could have done this  made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didnt  involves trickery in the options market.

The tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a risk alert memo on the topic in August 2013.

The SEC memo is titled Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations. You can read it here via the SEC website.

The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but heres a quick rundown:

If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.
A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock  meaning they are now short the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker)  and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.
The shares bought against the call options could be synthetic longs  meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock  as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.
This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of naked shorting as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.
As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasnt part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.
The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have bought back their short position via buying long shares  except they actually havent! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market makers hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.
It gets very complicated, very fast.

But the gist is that hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like theyve covered their shorts  even if they havent truly covered, and cant, for lack of available float  by way of exploiting loopholes that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.

Below is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:

Trader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealers close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.

In plain language, Trader A in SEC parlance could intentionally be giving the appearance of closing their illegal short position  when in reality they have no intention of doing so (or no ability to do so).

Under normal circumstances, tricks like these were used to help hedge funds maintain short positions that, legally speaking, they werent supposed to have because the shares were never properly located.

The GameStop squeeze is a unique scenario, however, because it is a very public fight to the finish between the Reddit army and the hedge funds that are short. Either the Reddit army wins and the hedge funds pay four-digit prices ($1,000 or more) to cover their shorts because of margin calls, or the hedge funds win and the GME share price falls back to the low double-digits.

In a battle like that, with public coverage influencing both sides, perception is a weapon. As such, if the hedge funds can generate the appearance of having covered most of their shorts, while driving down the GME share price through aggressive selling on low volume (something known as a short ladder attack), then the hedge funds increase their odds of breaking the squeeze  in part because media outlets will report things like GameStop Short Interest Plunges without looking deeper.

To be clear, it is also possible the first scenario is true.

GameStop shares may have fallen precipitously, with hedge fund short interest falling alongside, because a critical mass of long GME holders simply lost faith and tried to sell before the squeeze was complete. 

But it makes a lot of sense to question that narrative, given the wide array of deceptive tricks that some hedge funds (certainly not all of them, or even most of them) have used to perpetuate questionable or even illegal shorting tactics for a very long time.

And again, these tricks are so pervasive and old, the SEC wrote a risk alert memo about them in 2013.

As such, whether the drop in GameStop short interest was real or smoke and mirrors, the fact that changes in the level of short interest can be faked  with hedge funds making it look like they have closed out, but havent  is a serious compliance loophole that should be forcefully addressed.

As a side note, the answer to this problem likely resides in the (removed)

Apart from market maker privileges, the three big reasons hedge funds can play games with short positions  delayed reporting requirements, time windows of days (or even weeks in some cases) for trades to settle, and related transactions being executed in different places, or with different counterparties, for the sake of deception  could all be answered with a (removed)-based settling and clearing system where transactions are noted instantly and made visible to all parties (plus the SEC).

Title: VIAC AND MSOS MY PICKS FOR THE YEAR
VIAC and MSOS my picks of the year

Two fantastic picks to look at for February and 2021 
VIAC and MSOS details on calls below. Positions listed below but I have calls and equity on both 2-26 3-19 calls 45-60 on VIAC and 2-19 calls 42-50 MSOS  see details below. 

ViacomCBS investor day will price the stock far above current valuations based on Pluto Tv Paramount plus and showtime. This will be one of the most significant Investor events in 2021 on pair with the Disney investor event in December. The VIAC trade is based in many factors including the growth of free streaming globally and production capacity. Look at the trends coming from Netflix and Amazon who both look at Viac for content production capacity. Pluto TV just signed a major content deal with Netflix for narcos I expect to see more from this as NFLX chase towards profits. Before discounting VIAC look at Pluto Tv. 

Next we have my favorite US pure cannabis ETF which focuses on the big four stocks and sold off big Today. This will print money an  after the second week in February when the cannabis stocks all beat earnings. More people
Smoked weed in the last month of 2020 than any month before. Facts. This will translate to the ETF across the board and I alread the took advantage today and bought the equity and the calls see below. 


Long VIAC calls around 2-24 because of the investor day. 
Long the equity and the calls. Strike dates 2-26 3-5 3-19 strike prices 50, 55 ,60 coverage all over both dates and prices for near maximum upside. 

US pure cannabis ETF is one of the best plays around with the industry set to explode over the next 5 years and legalization in the next 2 years 
 
Also long MSOS calls and equity because of the big surge in cannabis demand and how it translates to the stocks. 2-19 calls for MSOS 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 
Coverage all over 2-19 strike date with a healthy variety of prices.

Edit: 2/4/21 11:31 am 
After some review and research im moving most of my 2-19 calls above 46 $ strike for the 3-19 50s 55s and 60s.

Title: Viac and Pluto Tv get aboard the rocket ship
Positions:
VIAC calls 2/12 56c  2/19 55c 2/26 50c 3/5 55c 3/19 55c


Look at the Pluto TV acquisition from VIAC and you see the winner winner chicken dinner, WS is betting on the wrong streaming play with Netflix, look at the future of streaming and subscription fatigue. Pluto TV is the cure. There has been a lot of press and DD but no one is paying attention, investor day is 23 days away. After 2-24 no one will doubt the future of streaming and the fast partnership with Netflix and narcos proves it. I dont think NFLX is a bad play. I did last year and was wrong but if you look at their current path to profitability it intersects hard with Pluto tv and Viacomcbs production capacity for streaming additional content. 

from the library licensing deals to the possibility of a new Chapelle show on Netflix owned in part by viac as part of a big deal with Dave to the Pluto TV Narcos deal cited in the last earnings call we can see a huge leap forward for streaming overall based entirely on the NFLX VIAC relationship. Monetization is a long term process for some of these pieces of big content and after a period of time it will no longer add new subs like narcos. 

But Pluto Tv can help with ad based monetization and no sub or sign in required. If you look at the overall package we see  that more shows could follow like ozark or maybe a sopranos channel for syndication like monetization a&amp;e tried with no cursing but fuck that shit. 

If you missed the point dont feel bad your like most of Wall Street today. VIAC is value in plain sight and its a growth stock in a hyper growth sector. We wont see another streaming opportunity like this. After investor day on 2-24 the world will realize what has been silently growing for years. This is a huge opportunity and Ive posted my positions before but I will again. 

Positions:
VIAC calls 2/12 56c  2/19 55c 2/26 50c 3/5 55c 3/19 55c

Title: Schwab DD part 2 - Next Multi Bagger - Daily Trade Growth 100 % from last quarter and Q1 2021 Earnings Beat
**Daily Average Trade Growth**

$SCHW just release its daily average trade summary for January 2021.

It has seen daily average trade growth from 5.13 million in October all the way to 10.3million by the end of January.

This number will continue to increase as retail investors growth continues to boom and upset traders on Etoro, Robinhood, Webull and Interactive broker flee to Vangaurd/Fidelity/TD/Schwab the few companies who didn't restrict trading.

https://preview.redd.it/t9vbj0ina9f61.png?width=1560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc9dc2b2fe100127e9cd2faa618c693db3a8bd03

**Revenue Sensitivity (daily average trades)**

Taken directly from their winter business update which was released online yesterday.

[https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/about-schwab/schw\_2021\_winter\_business\_update\_020221.pdf](https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/about-schwab/schw_2021_winter_business_update_020221.pdf)

Calculating revenue growth just on the daily average trades we can see that they will be experience increased revenues this quarter of:

10,326 - 6,543 (average daily trades for all last quarter) = 3,782/ 100 \* 60M = 2.2 Billion increase in revenues just as a result of increased daily trades. This is assuming the 10,326 daily trades stays flat for the rest of the quarter. I expect the daily trades to continue to rise as a result of increased retailer activity and market trend. Lets say 2.5 Billion increase as a result of retail investor growth.

To put this in perspective they reported 4.1 Billion in revenue in Q4 last quarter. If they are to report 6.5 Billion plus this stock will jump 30%+ next earnings. Combined with cost savings with the TD merger Net income will see a increase of over 50% from last quarter sending this to $80-100 after next earnings report.

**Margin Balances:**

Schwab had to restrict the use of margin balances on select stocks during the January boom as retail investors started to opt to use margin to increase their holdings and risk. Margin usage has seen a drastic increase per their Q4 statements and I expect Q1 to follow suit with continued growth.

**Part 1 DD Summary:**

**Average Daily users:** 20% increase from the October 2020 numbers to December 2020 alone. The January numbers will even be substantially higher with TD Ameritrade and Schwab both reporting network strain due to the influx of new investors signing up last week to get into GME/AMC/BB. This trend wont be stopping anytime soon, the retail investor's strength is gaining. Just look at Wallstreetbets alone we had 2.2 million members as of Monday and now we are sitting at 7 million.

**Future/Longevity of Brokerages:**

Etoro, Webull and RH will be facing lawsuites and scrutiny as a result of their trade restrictions. Do you want your money sitting in a brokerage with possible liquidly issues as a result of lawsuites.

**Balance Sheet Strength:**

Schwab has the strongest balance sheet of any brokerage on the market. With Trillions of dollars under management. This means that they will not need to restrict purchasing power of shares when there are substantial new deposits.

**Quote directly from Mark Cuban's AMA:**

When you load back up, fight a broker with TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS in assets on their balance sheet. Someone that can be there when the fight starts and wont blink an eye.

**GME and AMC Round 2**

For any future short squeeze traders will need to transfer their accounts to Schwab/TD/Fidelity to make sure their are no trade restrictions and bullshit manipulation. Schwab/TD and Fidelity are the only brokerages who have strong enough balance sheets to support future potential squeezes.

**Monthly Activity Report**

Schwab releases monthly activity report 2 weeks after the most recent month. This report will summarize daily trade growth, new deposits, new brokerage accounts. This report is expected in the next 2 weeks. Most likely on the 15th. $SCHW will explode similar to what IBKR did this week when these results are issued. This is your chance to get in cheap with $SCHW trading at 15% of its high and 25% off its recent price targets which were issued prior to this retail growth frenzy.

**TLDR:** Schwab is undervalued thanks to market sell off and will fly come February 15th when January activity report is released. It will run back to its ATH's in the mid 60s thanks to new customer deposits/transfers from shit brokerages and daily trade growth.

I expected Schwab to report revenue of 6.5B plus this quarter or a 50% increase from prior quarter with net income increasing 50-100% as a result of the TD merger cost synergies. This stock will be trading at over $100 come earnings in April

Calls are cheap.

Title: AMC and GME threshold Security List
Found this on Investopedia

"Although the list does not specify the cause of the failed settlements, it does provide regulators with a starting point from which to research the source of the failures. Meanwhile, the NYSE has its own threshold list, **which as of March 27, 2020, includes a number of stocks, including AMC Entertainment (AMC), GameStop (GME),** and Blue Apron Holdings (APRN)"

Also went to NYSE website and checked threshold securities list for myself.  Yup.  Gamestop is still there.

As this ape understands it, per investopedia, this could be a starting point to see if there was market manipulation or short selling (but it could be due to human error instead).   Big meeting Thursday with Yellen etc.   Anyone smarter than me know how something could continue to be on the list for possibly months and there was no investigation?

Title: Why you should hold. Opportunity still exists. *Long read 10 Min* Realistic outlook.
*Im holding shares of GME at a average price of $56, my view may be biased but I tried to look at all evidence and not be.*

I know a lot of you are looking for confirmation that you should still hold, the truth is that may or may not be in your best interest. Only you can decide will all the information you have whats best. Dont listen to random people online.

However Im going to let you know why Im still holding. I bought in with a average price of $56 and a lot of the shares bought below $100 will be held by people who havent sold yet and arent planning on. Institutions and smart investors with a good amount of shares (*200+*) are currently holding, mostly paper hands (people who jumped on because of media/word of mouth) are gone now and they most likely didnt have a big amount of shares anyway. We also temporarily lost swing traders because of the restrictions and loss of momentum, people with big balances who seen big dips as swinging opportunities (*$124 to $300 for example*) yes they sell but when they buy it brings pressure back and the price up which brings confidence for other people to invest in. I still think SI is high and HF arent out the game yet. With how high the SI is and the low float I think we would have seen a lot more volume on Wednesday/Thursday/Friday. The whole world was buying so this kind of volume to me even if it was HF unloading dosent signal them unwinding. 

*So whats the game plan?*

Well firstly I think the HF couldnt have let the whole world buy shares and have a short squeeze, they would be in to much debt and the price may very well have gone past $2000 due to a massive amount of people buying (*people normally not involved in stocks*) and the HF would of become insolvent. What I think the HF did is allow retail to buy during the week with Melvin unwinding their position, then once retail buying pressure starts to decrease due to people already in the stock, start to coordinate together with other HFs to restrict buying on some brokers (*decrease buying pressure*) and slow down the momentum caused by the internet and people talking about the squeeze. They would then let people sell and induce FUD which changed the narrative and worked, the price is now at a more comfortable level for them $90. On the 09/02/21 we will see latest SI (*2 weeks ago date*) and Im assuming it will still be over 100%. They will try to bring price as low as they can but there will be a people with large amount of shares bought early they wont fold (*some cant sell*). When good earnings come out and in addition to Cohen turning the company around and increasing the valuation until fair price is $100. 

Then we may see the HFs unwind and the short squeeze would happen, at a much lower price for them as to not have to buy back shares at $500+ also with less people involved (*retail got bored/lost too much money and isnt financially involved with GME*) there will be less competition to buy shares. They dont want the whole worlds eyes on them during the squeeze. This is a waiting game for institutions and smart money. If you have the money and time to hold it would be smart or to make a position at theres prices would also be smart. We wait for Cohen to turn the company around which would tell everyone whos shorting this company that it will be fair valued at $100 and they (*shorts*) would not be able to bankrupt the company or get the share price back to where they or originally shorted it.

TL;DR - HF still have to initiate MOASS. Not yet though people need to hold for Cohen to take action and creat a positive outlook for the company, HF wouldnt want to pay interest on a company whose valuation will be going up for years. They would unwind. 

Heres some emojis for you retarded apes 

Title: DD: Why GME Valuation is valid at $300+?
The 2020 pandemic year and onward has been the year of insane valuations. Whether attributed to more retail investor involvement, stimulus from the government, lack of spending elsewhere, the Fed, etc, some companies are the chosen ones for the high valuations while others don't get the privilege of being among WallStreet's favored.

&amp;#x200B;

For the apes / autists in the group, company valuation is also called the market cap. It's the share price \* outstanding shares (not just float shares).

&amp;#x200B;

GME Market Cap (Valuation) at $300/share assuming the number of outstanding shares is constant, would roughly be $21b ($300 \* 69.75M shares).  The main metric to compare companies valuation justification is the EPS or earnings per share. This is often just called a multiple. That is, if the EPS is $1 for the year, the PE is 300 at a $300/share price.

&amp;#x200B;

Generally, companies within the same industry would have similar PE ratios but it depends if it's been blessed or not by the WallStreet powers.

&amp;#x200B;

According to CIS Market, the average PE ratio for Internet, Mail Order, and Online Shops is 77.13 with the retail sector overall at 47.36. Ulta Beauty Inc (ULTA) which is an in-person salon retail has a wopping 72.42 valuation with an annual consensus of $3.94 EPS. Source: [https://csimarket.com/Industry/Industry\_Valuation.php?s=1300](https://csimarket.com/Industry/Industry_Valuation.php?s=1300).

&amp;#x200B;

Now GME does have some baggage in that it hasn't had a profitable year in 3 years with the pandemic really hurting it. In addition, its debt to assets ratio has been steadily rising since 2017 to as high as 87% as of Q3 2020. But, the turn around has been looking good with it's profit margins as well increasing and the last EPS of -$0.29 was a massive surprise to the estimate of -$0.85. The consensus for the year is -$2.07. But when there is a mass pandemic and people aren't shopping, I would say this is pretty good all things considering.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, given Ryan Cohen's appointment in helping the company make a more digital transformation, the challenge will be capital. Innovation and growth costs. GameStop has a lot of assets though in the form of real estate. If they are able to reduce costs while growing their digital footprint both through game services like Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, or Steam, and eCommerce sales for older nostalgia games, they could very well reach $3-$5 EPS within a couple of years (that is roughly $0.75 - $1.25 per quarter). At a $4 EPS (in between the two), this is only a 75 PE ratio which is not farfetched at all especially inline with the Internet / Online Shops industry as the company reinvents itself. While debt will continue to be a drag on the company in the short-term, I think there is plenty of opportunity for GME to innovate here. 

&amp;#x200B;

What Wall Street doesn't want you to see is that they've valued and supported bullishly many other companies at high valuations. TSLA P/E ratio is 1,380.65 whereas the current auto industry PE is 20.4. Toyota is 14.86. Even some of Wall Street called TSLA the 4-WTF Chart of the year - [https://wolfstreet.com/2020/12/12/tesla-the-quadruple-wtf-chart-of-the-year-it-should-just-sell-shares-on-autopilot-at-huge-prices-and-exit-sordid-business-of-making-cars/](https://wolfstreet.com/2020/12/12/tesla-the-quadruple-wtf-chart-of-the-year-it-should-just-sell-shares-on-autopilot-at-huge-prices-and-exit-sordid-business-of-making-cars/), but alas all the bears have kinda called it quits on TSLA with short interest at it's all time low. The valuation doesn't scare them with price targets above $1k. The difference? Enough people said f-u WallStreet, we like the company and believe in it so we are going to buy it and hold and don't care what you say and do.

Note: I'm long GME @ $325.

Title: Why invest in Vaxart Inc. (VXRT)
I expect today Phase 1 results before Vaxart speaks in the early afternoon (ET).

The results must have been known since mit December and substantial parts of the results already in November! Remember the last person for phase 1 was recruited in November and primary completion of the study in early December !

And again - phase 1 is an open label study (no blinding for anybody !). Vaxart knows the data the very moment when their laboratory machines give their results (e.g neutralising antibody titers from an ELISA Test)

Vaxart must know the results since many weeks.

Why does it take so long? Phase 1 is a relatively small study. The reason is the talks which are behind the scene. While we get Hamster results, I am confident that Vaxart had several meetings with OWS and WHO COVAX committee talking about large multi hundred million dose production.

It is only consistent that Vaxart is hiring so many highly qualified and well paid staff as indicated on their website: all prepared for large scale production. Contractor is secured as well. All is set.

I would not even exclude that we may not get phase 1 results today before the conference if anything is still to be negotiated between Vaxart and OWS or Vaxart and WHO. This could even further delay the announcement.

It is also possible that we first get phase 1 results today before the NY Academie of science meeting and then followed in some days by OWS and/or WHO announcement.

In any case if we do not get news Premarket - this would be indicative that something very big goes on behind the scene. But zero doubt that the phase 1 data would disappoint. Keep this stock, it may change the fate of this pandemic but also your financial being

Title: DD for $AB
Before I begin this DD, no this is not the next GME. There is not a next GME. That's not a thing, so stop saying it is. Okay, with that out of the way here we go:

Last week on January 24th, Nancy Pelosi's husband disclosed buying 4 different tickers. The tickers were TSLA, AAPL, DIS, and AB. Most of the mainstream media were very focused on talking about the TSLA, AAPL, and DIS yet only very briefly mention the fact he bought 20,000 shares of AB. I found this particular stock pick very odd in comparison to TSLA, AAPL, and DIS. It's an odd pick because

A. I hadn't ever heard of ticker AB before reading this story. And

B. Paul Pelosi bought deep ITM calls on TSLA, AAPL, and DIS. AKA calls any smooth brain could make. These calls are super safe long term plays, and require no brain power or risk for how deep in the money they are. In comparison to those three companies, he bought SHARES of AB. I found this extremely odd. For those reasons, I began to look into the company to attempt to see why he made this purchase in particular.

After non-extensive research I came to two different possible conclusions why he would buy shares of AB with as high conviction as TSLA, AAPL, and DIS:

1. He liked the high dividend yield of 7.72% and the slow yet steady upward projectory of the stock. OR
2. He knows something I don't.

So, because I am retarded I went with number 2 and YOLO'd 30 Apr 19 45$ calls @ .50 cent strike price. I will hold these calls with diamond hands and we'll see what happens.

EDIT: This is entirely speculative and could be high risk. I'm retarded so I don't know if it's high risk or not. Invest at your own risk. (for the new members of this sub)

Title: deliver the morning news and catch the plague.
The intention of this post is not to suggest a price target, nor predict the future direction of $GME () but to instead address some of the fear that spread through the public yesterday and made the panic.

There were many  who delivered the morning  route directly onto the lawns of those who scripted the headlines the night before. The question is though, *how many* ? How many delivered to the Hedge Fund's while they strolled out onto the front lawn of their mansions in their Ugg boots, sipping their freshly brewed covfefe.

*How much of the trading volume was* *and how much was* ?

I'm just your average . My thumb is barely opposable. Luckily, yahoo finance allows you to navigate its site by simply licking the keys. After a couple short circuits resulting from my overly fluid salivary glands, I stumbled upon the following trading data. This isn't no technical shit, I can only count to 10. Luckily for me that is all that I need.

Below you will see the Open, High, Low and Close for the past few weeks. Now, I'm no wrinkle brain but I see a lot of 0's for us dumb who randomly mash 'buy at market'. Only who are whipped into line by their evil overlords have the mental capacity to target numbers such as 0 with such precision:

*"But you just drew triangles around numbers with red crayon?"* you might hear yourself ask. Well you're wrong. They're fucking rectangles. Retarded aside, coincidentally, there are lots of red rectangles over the previous week of trading. This to me, highlights when our good pal came to visit.

From Jan 26th till 28th, the crayon is only scribbled over the daily 'High'. Is this from scrambling to buy back shares in an illiquid, sell depth? Maybe. Maybe just had limit sells because they like taking while not looking.

The more interesting part is that 7 out of 9 price points over the last three days have fingerprints on them. To put this in perspective, the next 00's not in this picture isn't until Jan 4th, and the next is on Dec 11th. Not many 00's. This is more than coincidence.

Now we all know the have powered up and SkyNet is coming for us, but the questions remains; *Were there enough* *to allow the shorts to exit?* or was it mostly just playing Ring Around the Rosie and passing plague ridden tissues to each other while the foundations of Melvin and Citadel start to crumble.

If it was the latter, then the are going to have to work extra hard now that we only have  and is fuelling for launch.

Positions: 60$GME @ $128 average.

TLDR: Lots of volume. If &gt; then .

Title: Motivation Wednesday $GME [My diary notes] [Remember the loyal soldiers who standed besides King Leonides. This is us, the diamond hands, standing our ground next to the King DFV]
Day three of the second week of the fight.

Dear diary,

Last week we had seen some shit in the market. Brokers shut down the American free market for some time. The whole world talked about us at first, but then the attacks began.

We were marked as market manipulators. However, we had support. By millionaires, billionaires and politicians. Soon we werent market manipulators anymore, but people who saved businesses.

However, the HF were smart. They had a crisis meeting and changed the narrative. They took positions in SLV and then called their friend at the news outlets. They changed the narrative from a GME squeeze to a silver squeeze. The whole day everybody on mainstream media talked about fucking SLV. But we kept strong, we fought the fake news with facts until they stopped talking about it. During this attack we lost some men who switched to SLV.

However, then Friday came. The HF started their short ladder attacks. At first we did not recognize these attacks. We didnt know how to defend ourselves, then to stay together, buy the dips and shut our eyes from the reds. A lot of options were in the call and it costed them millions.

The HF called all their quants this weekend. They picked some PhD students from Harvard, Stanford and Oxford and made their plans. They did the math, analysed WSB and then knew what to do: *WSB grew from 2.2 million to 8.4 million in a week. Most of these people are not retarded enough to hold the stocks if they lose 5%. So lets continue the short ladder attacks and let them fear the big money.*

And thats what happened on Monday. They regrouped and started the attack We lost a lot of apes on Monday. Then the second attack on Tuesday. I must say, I almost cried. A lot of people left the fight. They told their wifes boyfriends that he will become a millionaire, but lost a couple of hundreds, so they left the fight. At the end of the day there were only a couple of diamond handed people left. Moral is low. On twitter we called for our Daddy Ryan Cohen, however, no response

But then the post of u/DFV. After topping an unrealized return of 48 million, he lost approximately half during this weeks fight. He came with his post and showed us that he will continue the fight with or without us. The most loyal to DFV and GME are staying now. Me too. DFV showed me how to become rich, he gave me a taste, something I never had. Now, I will stay until the end.

This reminds me of the fight of the 300 Spartans against the Persians. During the first fights everybody stayed and fought successfully. But then when King Leonidas wanted to continue for freedom and respect, a majority of his soldiers left. Only the most loyal and strong stayed. This is us now in this moment. The loyal and strong Spartans are the Diamond Hands. Our king is DFV and our fight is against the strong HF. We might die, but that does not matter. Because in the end we showed them our strength and saved GME.

BTW Mods, maybe make a motivation flair?

The captain got hurt during the fight. He retreated with his paperhands fighters. It took a while, but he told the story of the dapper and mightly King Leonidas and his diamond hand soldiers. He came back with the greatest and largest army yet and defeated the Persians. 

Yes wait, our captain is Ryan. He will come to help us. He wouldnt just meme some on twitter and leave us alone. 

Title: Fuck TSLA, NIO, and GM -&gt; Go for Ford 
So I want to know why Ford is still trading at 11$. I love ford, my first car I personally bought was a Ford Fusion. Microsoft wanted to partner with Ford ($F) but had to go with General Motors ($GM) because Ford already was talking to Google ($GOOG).

Position Disclosure: 20 $F 11$ calls for 2/5, 6 $IDEX 5$ calls 3/19

There's a fireside chat this Thursday where they lay out their EV strategy but here's why I'm in safe calls

1. Ford outsells NIO and TSLA byyy farrrr!
2. Partnership with Rivian isn't forgotten and a team committed for a futuristic EV design (more people like how the All-Electric Ford F150 looked compared to the Tesla Cybertruck (and won it in a tug-of-war battle recently) 
3. GM is trading at more than 4x the price of F (buying Nikola and faking a EV Hummer video)
4. Back in 2014, the Ford navigation was using $MSFT Cortana's voice for their entertainment / engagement. I'm sure $MSFT wanted to partner with Ford but had to settle something like $GM because it was already talking with $GOOG (which has most chance of creating driverless cars).
5.  Ford unlocked it's CANbus that year and let developers go to town with their apps. For a moment their cars were used by $UBER and some private researchers in their driverless fleet

It's not gonna move to $50 but it definitely has potential to reach $20 imo. The price action is slow so many of the contracts (at the money) are cheap.

Title: How and why NOK will reach the moon?
NOK will colonize the moon and bring 4G to barbaric aliens! NASA selected Nokia exclusively to build the first cellular network on the moon. 

[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/20/talking-on-the-moon-nasa-and-nokia-to-install-4g-on-lunar-surface](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/20/talking-on-the-moon-nasa-and-nokia-to-install-4g-on-lunar-surface)

First, in regards to Nokias business. Nokia, unfortunately, doesnt manufacturer phones anymore. Nokia sold the right to produce Nokia branded phones to HMD Global while retaining the right to have some input. Nokias current business concentrates on mobile networks such as 5G, network infrastructures, and cloud services. In other words, Nokia business pertains to the most basic component of our modern civilization. Especially so the Post-COVID world where networking is even more important than before. Think of the Tesla cars. They are connected to AT&amp;T cellular networks which are built by Nokia. Nokia will be leading the networks that would eventually enable automation. And when that happens, Nokia will have a continuous revenue stream. 

[https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g](https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g)

Nokia is leading mobile networks with 27% of the world (excluding China) market share of 4G and 5G. It currently holds more than 3000k patents for 5G. Nokia other major competitors are Ericson, Huawei, and ZTE. Some countries of the Western hemisphere and the G7 banned Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE from operating in their countries. I suspect this will continue in the future. Leaving us with only Nokia and Ericson. But couldnt a Mega-Cap such as Google or Tesla somehow eliminate NOK and ERIC? NOK holds more than 3000 patents already. So there is a strong barrier of entry into such a business. That wont happen unless Nokia licences a patent for such a company. In this hypothetical scenario, the Mega-Cap would have to acquire Nokia. Which in turn will raise the price of the stock. I think this is the case that is similar to MSFT under Ballmers where the stock price was stagnant for many years. But slowly surged under Nadella. Though given the catalyst of COVID-19, I think the surge will happen quicker with NOK.

At 4.53 a share. NOK P/E ratio is 30.81x. Which is a small discount in comparison with the S&amp;P 500 which has P/E ration of about 39x. This establishes Nokia not only as a growth stock but also as a value stock. The lowest that NOK dropped to was 2.34. Which happened back in March. At the current price, I believe that NOK is well within the margin of safety. 

With that being said, there are some problems that should be addressed. The income trend in the past few years is problematic. But this can offset by the fact that NOK has contracts well into the future with many nations states and private companies that should generate ample income until NOK is able to eliminate Huawei and ZTE and in turn, dominate the market (With Ericson). Also, Nokia is spening billions on research 

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-proximus/nokia-wins-5g-contract-from-proximus-luxembourg-idUSKBN28P0WJ 

The second complication is that Biden or other G7 leaders could potentially reverse Trumps ousting of Huawei and ZTE. I dont think this is likely. But its certainly a possibility. But even if it happens. Nokia will still have a big market share. And 100% market share of the moon and will always have a priority over Huawei and ZTE for government projects for reasons of national security. Also, there is a substantial amount of money spent on R&amp;D which will I believe will be a catalyst in the future surge in NOK.

It should be worth noting that just one day after RH banned NOK, Blackrock released an amendment to their ownership of NOK. Increasing their shares by  21,140,777 shares.

Even though at this point Blackrock owns 5% of practically everything. The increase is a good question. 

Now you might ask me why not Ericson? ERIC is also a good stock. But I see more value in NOK. Also, the fact the NOK is working on 1 Terabit per second internet, and that it will bring 4G to the moon, and the fact that Nokia is #1 by patterns give it an edge in innovative growth. 

Final words: GME to the moon and pigs get slaughtered.

Title: $CRSR Corsair DD / Earnings play
 

Corsair Gaming ($CRSR)

*Redefining gaming, eSports, and streaming*

Company Overview

Corsair Gaming is an American computer hardware and peripherals company founded in 1994 and headquartered in California.

They acquired Elgato Gaming in 2018 to expand to the streaming gear market, Origin PC and SCUF gaming in 2019 to expand into the custom-built PC systems and console controllers markets, respectively, and during 2020 they acquired Gamer Sensei and EpocCam, and partnered with Pipeline to grow into the gaming and streaming coaching market.

Corsair went public on September 23, 2020, with its IPO priced at $17, valuing the company at about $1.3B.

Understanding the Business

**Value Proposition**

Gamer and Creator Peripherals:

which represents around 25% of net revenue, includes gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets, streaming gear, and high performance console controllers.

Gaming Components Systems:

which represents around 75% of net revenue includes computer cases, power supply units (PSU), high performance memory products (40% of net revenue), and custom-built gaming systems.

Acquisitions and Partnerships:

During 3Q 2020 Corsair acquired Gamer Sensei, a gaming coaching platform, EpocCam, an app that allows iPhones to serve as a webcam, and partnered with Pipeline, a course-based education platform for streamers.

Industry

**Market Size**

According to Jon Peddie Research, the global gaming and streaming gear markets is expected to reach $40B by the end of 2020. Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest 1.05% CAGR until 2022. However, during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10% year-over-year.

Additionally, DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video-game coaching market surpasses $1B.

**Industry Fundamentals**

Growth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals.

Popularity of gaming is increasing:

According to Newzoo, there are an estimated 2.7B gamers worldwide, which are expected to spend $159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8.3% CAGR to exceed $200B by 2023. PC and console gaming represents 51% of the total market, and mobile gaming 49%. Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market.

Tech-driven improvements in game quality:

Advances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences. This in turn, places increased demand on high-performance computing hardware.

Increasing gaming and streaming engagement:

Some interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include:

* On average, video gamers spend six hours and 20 minutes each week playing video games
* More than 38% of gamers would like to become professionals if it could support themselves
* Gamers from novice to aspiring professionals report missing daily activities due to gaming, missed sleep is the most pervasive
* Watching gamers play video games online is more popular than watching traditional sports for 18-25 year olds.

**The eSports and streaming flywheel**

The rise in popularity and viewership of eSports brings more investment from publishers, sponsors, advertisers, team owners, and leagues to the eSports industry. Increased investment brings more players and increased performance focus of gamers who advance from less engaged gaming to high-performance gameplay, which in turn brings more viewers.

Competitive Landscape &amp; Risks

**Competition**

The gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition, constant price pressure and rapid change. Competition across Corsairs product offering includes:

**Gaming keyboards and mice** \- Logitech and Razer

**Headsets and related audio products** \-Logitech, Razer, and HyperX

**Streaming gear** \- Logitech and AVerMedia

**Performance controllers** \- Microsoft and Logitech

**PSUs, cooling solutions, and computer cases** \- Cooler Master, NZXT, EVGA, Seasonic, and Thermaltake

**High performance memory** \- G.Skill, HyperX, and Micron

**Pre-built and custom-built gaming PCs** \- Alienware (Dell), Omen (HP), Asus, Razer, iBuypower and Cyberpower

**Competitive Strategy**

The company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.

**Market Share**

According to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.

**Growth Strategy**

Move into the Asia Pacific region:

The Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.

Complimentary acquisitions:

Corsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.

New Markets:

Uses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.

**Threat of New Entrants**

Because of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).

**Threat of Substitution**

A significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsairs business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.

Cloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-users system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.

According to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.

Additionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.

**Moats**

There does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsairs market share across their product offering.

**Other Relevant Risks**

Due to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.

Title: What if GME were to bring back their Generous Quarterly Dividend Payment?
Hey Retards what if GME were to start declaring a quarterly dividend again? Last paid out Mar 2019 ($0.38/share) before shorts started attacking. Looks like the vermon holding SHORT POSITIONS would be RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYMENT to the owners of the shares #delivertheshares, if the they didn't BUY BACK before X dividend date.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Buy the fucking dip and HOLD FFS. Stay the course.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042215/if-investor-short-dividendpaying-stock-record-date-are-they-entitled-dividend.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042215/if-investor-short-dividendpaying-stock-record-date-are-they-entitled-dividend.asp)

&amp;#x200B;

Short Stocks and Dividend Payments 

Shorting a stock is essentially selling it and then buying it back at a future price.

1 - If the price falls, there is a profit. If the price rises to $512.00 there is a LOSS. The stock needs to be BORROWED from a shareholder to sell it without owning it. A brokerage firm usually handles this process. There is generally a borrowing fee for the stock, depending on its availability and liquidity. Additionally, the borrower of the stock is responsible for paying any DIVIDENDS.

&amp;#x200B;

2 - If an investor is short a stock on the record date, they are NOT entitled to the dividend.

&amp;#x200B;

3 - In fact, the investor is instead responsible for PAYING the dividend owed to the lender of the shorted stock that they borrowed.

Special Considerations:

Shorting stocks are considered RISKY and appropriate only for sophisticated traders (MELVIN IS A DUMBASS) due to the general upward trend of stocks, borrowing costs, and the skewed risk-reward nature of shorting. Over time, stocks appreciate as inflation erodes the value of currencies. Companies, through their business operations, protect against inflation as they can pass on rising costs to customers. This is one reason for the general upward trajectory of stock indexes over time.

&amp;#x200B;

Borrowing costs can be significant depending on the stock, typically between 2% and 10% annually. **30% in exceptional cases**.

&amp;#x200B;

4 - Of course, there is the additional cost of paying out DIVIDENDS. This is a significant drag on returns and compounds the difficulty of the task. Finally, **BASIC MATH** works against short selling as well. A stock can go up by multiples if there is a takeout offer or the company comes out with some INNOVATIVE product. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a fucking retard and have no idea what I'm taking about. I like this stonk. Buying the dips, holding since 2017.

Title: Short Sale And Volume Analysis suggests squeeze is NOT OVER yet
I am neither a financial advisor nor I am advising anything financially. However, reviewing the history of short sale and volume since the squeeze started to play out and common theme can be explained as follows:

https://preview.redd.it/nzo2l0d0n7f61.png?width=1138&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5b0237523571ffdded5e4ab3b391160a4cf5e39

Every time short sale ratio goes up we hold and buy the dip. As they lose steam we pile on and stonk goes higher. 

**Push and Pull**

1/27 onwards it seems traders have got involved heavily and while short ratio has remained consistent  (&gt;50%), most of the volume is downtrading suggesting paper hands are being shaken out. As data suggest, new short positions were opened at peak price on 1/27 . While, Most of the squeeze happened with heavy volume in first round. I guess, the question to ask is what is required to trigger second round.

1) buy volume increase / reduced short sale ratio ? ( fellow retards currently waiting for account transfers)

2) Failure to delivery deadlines approaching ?

3) More good news from management/board, RC etc.

Title: Aphria/SweetWater - Brews &amp; Branding
Brand Awareness - Aphria Brands on SweetWater Brews

SweetWater Brewing Company is a craft brewery founded in 1997 by Freddy Bensch and Kevin McNerney in Atlanta, Georgia. SweetWater's beers are unpasteurized and distribution is limited to select states

SweetWater recently annouced that their beer will [be available in 27 states with Western Expansion](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210121005247/en/SweetWater-Brewing-Company-Reaches-New-Heights-Launching-Statewide-in-Colorado-February-1)

&gt;SweetWaters expansion into the first U.S. state to legalize recreational marijuana comes shortly after its [November 2020 acquisition](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-inc-announces-strategic-entry-into-the-united-states-with-an-agreement-to-acquire-sweetwater-brewing-company-301166616.html) by Aphria Inc

Irwin simon, the CEO of Aphria, has a track record for aggressive expansion. He brings a unique background who specializes in M&amp;As. Aphrias recent acquisition of SweetWater was a strategic play to expand into US &amp; more importantly, creating brand awareness. 

&gt;We will establish and grow our U.S. presence through SweetWater's robust, profitable platform of craft brewing innovation, manufacturing, marketing and distribution expertise. At the same time, we will build brand awareness for our adult-use cannabis brands, Broken Coast, Good Supply, Riff and Solei, through our participation in the growing $29 billion craft brew market in the U.S. ahead of potential future state or federal cannabis legalization

**US Trademarks**

Aphria proactively filed US Trademarks for a number of their brands:

[Broken Coast](https://uspto.report/TM/90383411)

[Riff](https://uspto.report/TM/90383302)  

[Solei](https://uspto.report/TM/90383374)

Irwin is leveraging SweetWater's existing infrastructure to accelerate Aphria's entry into the U.S. ahead of federal legalization of cannabis to fuel sustainable profitable growth

I recently made a post in regards to [The Rolling 20s - LEAPs on Cannabis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lab9sk/the_rolling_20s_leaps_on_cannabis/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) where I highlight long term opportunities the marijuana industry presents with US legalization on the horizon. This is happeneing at an extreme rate &amp; Aphria will be positioning itself as a top tier brand in the US through SweetWater.

[Proof of Concept](https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Aphria-Inc.-November-2020-AGM-Presentation-FINAL.pdf)

**Broken Coast Brew** - *The best of the bud in the best of the brews*
&gt;Inspired by the one and only Broken Coast, these small batch craft brews will have you saying woah. Packed with incredible earthy, dank and complex cannabis-inspired flavours youll feel the sea breeze in no-time. (Pg.25)

**RIFF**  *Loud without the cloud*
&gt;Not for the un-inspired, RIFFs brew masters bring the house down. Hoppy, flavorful and aromatic our lineup brings the party to wherever you are. Join us in this joint effort and run the show with these flavour-packed brews. (Pg.26)

**Solei Hard Seltzer**  *it is always sunny with Solei*
&gt;There is no time to enjoy the sunshine like every time. Soleis hard seltzers are created with the perfect combination of freshness and crisp flavours. Made with sun-kissed fruits, Solei Hard Seltzer brings the sun all year round. (Pg.27)

I wouldnt be surprised to see the Solei concept featured on SweetWaters newly released [Premium Hard Seltzer](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210125005211/en/SweetWater-Releases-Oasis%C2%AE-Premium-Hard-Seltzer) at some point.

In addition to its traditional distribution footprint, SweetWater 420 Extra Pale Ale and IPA are served on all Delta flights nationwide plus internationally totaling more than 50 countries across six continents which has served to extend SweetWater's brand reach on both a national and international level. The Company also hosts an annual music festival, "SweetWater 420 Fest," that has evolved into one of the largest and most anticipated music festivals in the U.S., increasing brand awareness nationwide.

This move creates a branded cannabis lifestyle Products Company with a diverse revenue base. I strongly encourage everyone to look into the management on both sides and come to your own conclusions. I also made a post about about the Aphria/Tilray merger, feel free to check it out:

"Born, who grows corn and soybeans on 120 acres near Lovington, Illinois, about 135 miles northeast of St. Louis, feels confident enough that hes investing money to upgrade aging farm equipment. The fact that soybean and corn prices are at six- and seven-year highs made that decision easier.

Title: Future of Manufacturing: Desktop Metal (DM): short term and long term play
Hello fellow autistic children. I know GME is still the hottest thing around. But, I am here to present a smart play, short and long term.

Desktop Metal (DM) DD

DM is a pure play manufacturing company that develops metal 3d printers. They are looking to replace metal casting and metal injection molding in the next 5 - 10 years. I believe that it could become a major player in the advanced manufacturing revolution and have 10x valuation.

The share price right now is around $25. I am expecting it to go to at least $30 in the very near future and this can easily go to $100 in 2-3 years.

Pros :

1. Stellar team: The team consist of professors from MIT, engineers from google,  Stratasys and the likes.

2. Clients: All major automotive OEMs such as General Motors, Ford, Nissan as well as Electronics manufacturers such as SBD are their client.

3. They just launched a new manufacturing system today. The new printer eliminated the solvent debind process which will decrease the cost and time of manufacturing.

4. Earnings are coming up on 11th Feb.

5. The average price target is around $26. The high is $30. The buy rating is around 70% with 0% sell rating.

6. It has a 25% short interest. There are around 15000 $25 calls expiring on 19th Feb. The short sellers are trying to keep the price of the stock below $25. Notice that today the price jumped on the news of the new printer but fell immediately afterwards.

7. Chamath did a PIPE investment in this.

8. It's 10th on the PRNT etf by Cathie Woods.

9. They just bought a dental 3d printing company which is a leader in their field. They have enough cash reserve to buy competitors and increase their revenue streams.

Cons :

1. The company is still pre revenue. Earliest revenue would be by 2022 probably.

2. Huge competition from players such as 3ds, Stratasys, Formlabs etc

(More cons are welcome)

My positions:

100 shares at $21.35

7 calls for $40 05/21,
9 calls for $35 05/21,
1 call for $20 05/21

Due to all the positive sentiment around, this should easily run upto atleast $30 before the earnings. It has already touched $28 last week. Also, for the Technical analysis geeks, this has formed a nice cup and handle shape and should be ready to rocket!

Buying May or further call should make 75-100% profit in the short term. Should hold shares for the long term.

PS: This is not an investment advice. I am a Mechanical Engineer and I love 3d printing and hence I have invested in this stock. Please do your personal DD.

Title: $SKT DD (Tanger Outlet Malls) *VALUE PLAY* please read 
9th most shorted stock right now, great re-opening play to cope with new Covid environments. Tanger literally has open air malls that make it really unique in this new era of bricks and mortar retail.

Now, lets look at the technicals. It currently has a 52% short float, which lags large squeezes like GME (121%) and SPCE (72%), but exceeds that of other performing names like AMC and BB.

I think $SKT is so compelling at a roughly $1.2B market cap. For comparison, its primary competitor $MAC has double the valuation, but does not have the same flexible retail space as Tanger.

If you look at GMEs short squeeze, they shot up right around $20 or ($1.2B market cap)!!  Furthermore, Melvin and other big hedge funds are long on their $SKT shorts, and any surprise to the upside will send the stock absolutely flying.

Tanger has also reinstated their dividend. In a time where many bricks and mortar retail shops are desparate for cash, $SKT is out here with $700M of liquidity.

Companies with this much cash relative to their market cap are INTRINSICALLY UNDERVALUED. Even if this thing were to just double in market cap to just under $3B, that would leave a share price of roughly $32. The intrinsic value of the mall network is worth AT LEAST (in my mind) 5-7X where we are now at roughly $13 ($1.2B). 

These other names that I mentioned above have taken off given their market cap of $3-5B, and I FULLY EXPECT THAT RALLY TO CONTINUE. The short interest here is just too overwhelming for it to not push the stock flying at the slightest uptick.

But for the best value play, FACTORED WITH THE HEAVY SHORT FLOAT, I gotta go with $SKT. Holding 3200 shares at $17 and adding more as we go down. 18.7 days left for shorters to cover, so I think the squeeze is coming soon.

** Check out Tangers new CEO, Steven Yalof, if you are interested. He was a prominent leader at Simon Property Group, with the intent on expanding consumer base beyond retail stores. Lets hope he gets it right with $SKT. 

FEB 25 PT: $55

$SKT 

P.S. Do your patriotic duty and save the malls

***Well see how this goes ;)

Title: HUGE Uptick in Short Exempt Volume Today for GME Because Brokers Can Fuck You Publicly!
Created some plots using Finra's daily reports on short volume\[1\] since I was getting curious about the shorts since last week.... Below are the plots I put together with definitions by Finra. 

**Short Volume:** Aggregate reported share volume of executed short sale and short sale exempt trades during regular trading hours

https://preview.redd.it/q24kd07vx6f61.png?width=435&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89cdb34e8b2235106dca00af8ef2e630f0b0c3bd

**Short Exempt Volume:** Aggregate reported share volume of executed short sale exempt trades during regular trading hours

https://preview.redd.it/usbr5icxx6f61.png?width=435&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e76d48861397900d97620592af21d2ad29260404

#  Wait, WTF is a SHORT EXEMPT?

**- A short that doesn't have to follow the uptick rule, can be sold whenevs.**

# WHO THE FUCK SETS WHICH ARE SHORT EXEMPT?

# THE BROKERS, and it's not even checked unless an audit occurs

"...broker-dealers  are required to document their polices for how they mark orders as  exempt, and, if audited, provide evidence that they have followed their  documented policies and procedures. Broker-dealers therefore mark an order short exempt if they believe it  qualifies for an exception. The primary exception is the use of  non-standard pricing quotes for trade execution. **That means that if  prices come in outside the** [**National Best Bid or Offer (NBBO)**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nbbo.asp)**,  they can initiate a short-sale order that they judge would have  qualified as an uptick in more orderly markets.** Marking for these orders  is signified by SSE. All orders marked SSE will be closely checked by  self-regulatory organizations and the SEC for compliance with Regulation  SHO exceptions. " **-Investopedia**

TLDR; Broker-Dealers are marking a HUGE AMOUNT of shorts as exempt from the uptick rule because all of our smoothbrained sell limits of $69420,69 are outside the National Best Bid, according to them, but it's ok because they are self-regulating.... **FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUU.....**

Title: Short Interest, why numbers seem weird
If you were wondering like myself how the short squeeze could have already unwound, the short answer is, it hasn't, they merely changed how they are measuring it.

&amp;#x200B;

Found this in a comment buried in a comment on a post ([Sober view post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbaktb/sober_review_time_what_are_the_actual_data_we_can/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)) and thought I would shine some light on it. The sober view post has some very good DD presenting both potential upside and downsides in what I believe is a fair manner. Be cautious, there are a lot of downsides. I recommend you read it before you simply get hyped. That being said... Hype Train inbound 

 [S3 partners intentionally changed how they calculate SI % interest to manipulate public perception of shorts closing their positions.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/) 

Pretty much the reason why S3 partners is estimating 55% short interest is because they changed the formula. It would be equivalent to what we would call 122% SI before the change (other people's math, not my own).

&amp;#x200B;

They changed the formula from 

`SI = (shorts/float)`
to
`SI = (shorts/(float+shorts))`

This formula guarantees SI to always be beneath 100. 

Pretty much, 

0% is still 0%

50% is the new 100%

It doesn't scale up exactly linearly.

Do your DD, this is not financial advice, just thought I would bring this to light.

Be careful, do your research, not only is the game changing in front of us, but so are the standard measures.

Edit 2:

Cleaned up some formatting for mobile, added link to sobering post

Note:

I am not claiming the short squeeze is still happening or that it is likely happening. I would guess it's very likely they bought high strike puts which would make the amount we would have to go up SIGNIFICANTLY higher.

Assess your own risk, read the sobering post linked above, and seriously consider the risk you're willing to assume

Title: Quick DD: Why S3 Partners' Short interest data is either BS or it is saying shorts doubled down
Courtesy to u/smohyee for inspiration and picture

https://preview.redd.it/e4nurfxvy6f61.png?width=277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8d3a8b26c810c7eb7d9e321b1fbab3fd19545fa

Last few days there has been this talk about shorts already covered, and S3 Partner's data showed a large decline in short interest. However, is this the full picture? We will be looking at this using Math. 

Context :[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448)

 ""it reduces the traditional SI % Float, Instead of Shares Shorted/Float our calc is Shares Shorted/ (Float + Shares Shorted) ""

Basically, the S3 short interest is calculated as

f(x) = x/(k+x)

where f(x) is S3's short interest, x is shares shorted, and k is float, which we can assume is a constant

For the Math savvy autists, you probably already see the problem. If you are not, open Desmos and graph the above function.

For k been positive and real, This function **asymptotically approaches 1** i.e. 100%. It should be pretty obvious - shares shorted + something positive is larger than shares shorted, so the fraction is smaller than 1. And, surprise surprise, data before 1/29 have short interest higher than 1!

**That means that either S3 partners is completely bullshiting their data, or the more likely case -  short interest displayed before 1/29 is traditional interest.**

Looking at this tweet [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356392101806800897](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356392101806800897), we can see that the traditional SI on 2/1 is **78.16MM** shares on **51.03MM** float, which equates to....drum roll please...

***153%*** ***Short interest!***

So not only have the shorts not squeezed, they have doubled down. And this explains the price action much better - the price dipped down on a **Increased selling**.

Title: FISV WILL DOUBLE BEFORE EOY
Been holding $135 leap calls since $92, playing weeklies for the short term trades, and its only gonna get better as it has for me. Heres a little of my own DD.

There is So much to talk about. But, the First Data deal made Fiserv a powerhouse in payment processing and digital payments when they took over Clover. This market has three main pillars:
Point of sales (POS) terminals
Peer-to-peer (P2P) payments
E-commerce solutions
  Being a leader in any one of these categories should make Fiserv a $100 billion company. Its current value is $70 billion. But Fiserv is now the largest POS provider and P2P payment processor... And the company is going to use its expansive network to quickly build out its new omnichannel e-commerce solution.
A leader in all three of these categories has the potential to be well over a $300 billion company. FISV is partnered with Zelle, does more payments than PYPLs Venmo and SQ  CashApp. PYPL has a market cap of 278 billion as of last Friday. If FISV can get to $100 billion it should put its PT at $150 and thats very low ball. Their margins are going to continue to grow and if they just matched PYPL market cap, it would put them over $300 a share. There are several potential catalysts as far as buy backs, earnings, etc. 

As I mentioned above, Clover is bigger than Square, yet is only part of FISV business, and the two go after different markets. Clover (generally) works with bigger businesses. Over 90% of Clover customers process over $125,000 in payments annually. Only 65% of Squares customers transact that much. Not trying to bash SQ, only showing that FISV has a lot of catching up to do as it is still trailing SQ market cap by 30 Billion. 

The difference between Zelle and PYPLs Venmo and SQ (cash app) is that Zelle is backed by multiple large institutions like Chase, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank, and Capital One. The traditional financial institutions basically joined together to build a network so they wouldnt be outdone by the likes of Venmo or Cash App. The advantage is that all of the financial institutions involved
in Zelle are marketing the P2P service to their customers and its only going to grow. Fintech will be one of the hottest sectors going forward and FISV will be the leader. No reason why FISV isnt at least $150-200 by EOY. Earnings 2/9. Dont miss this undervalued STRONG company.

Title: Post $GME and $AMC - Next Potential Short Squeeze Target ($TLRY)
For those of you still holding $GME and $AMC, Congratulations! Over the past week you've been bombarded with numerous challenges, from brokers restricting purchases, fake news, to stock dilution. It is always harder to hold a winning position than a losing one so my hats off to you sir if you are still holding.

With that being said, I'd like to talk to you about a next potential candidate for our short squeeze strategy. The company is Tilray ($TLRY). You've probably seen this symbol floating around in different posts but I'd like to talk to you specifically about the numbers and the timing of it.

If you've been living under a rock or on a tree (You ape) Tilray is a Canadian Cannabis company with its stock traded on the Nasdaq (Not a lot of legal Cannabis companies are traded on the regulated exchanges so this is a big thing). Aphria ($APHA) is in the process of acquiring Tilray and post-acquisition will become the largest Cannabis company in the world. The deal is expected to close sometime during the second quarter and $APHA will be taking over the Tilray name and the $TLRY symbol on the Nasdaq.

As per Yahoo Finance, the latest float is about 95 Million shares and even though the current shares sold short (From Jan 15, 2021) is 34.37 Million which is moderate, one should pay attention to the historical total shares sold short which from a month ago has grown more than 24%. This means there is something in play and I am also willing to bet based on current price action and historical trends, the next short interest release will go up as well.

&amp;#x200B;

[Large Rise in Total Shares Sold Short](https://preview.redd.it/pemqywhf07f61.png?width=1358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=813869b0195bc158c342de184f9a9dae2d3d598f)

Based on the amount of money involved there is probably one large or multiple large hedge funds playing this since they are the only ones sophisticated enough to sell shares short especially involving that much money. You can also look at the price action itself prior to Monday (When Good news got released) during different times of the day, there are always trades put in near the closing to make sure the prices don't exceed a certain price level which indicates true active manipulation by the bears. Retail traders are not sophisticated enough to do this thus indicating large hedge fund involvement.

There are a couple of factors that will help us with this conquest.

1. The Timing and News: Obviously, with this democratically controlled congress, legalization is a priority and has the highest chances of succeeding in this current political environment. As you have seen before (Do your own DD), any indication or news of progress of legalization has pushed this stock up. As of Monday, three senators; Chuck Schumer (NY), Cory Brooker (NJ), and Ron Wyden (OR) just promised to introduce marijuana legalization reform in the "early part" of the year. So there is a string of news and progress coming.
2. Way better fundamentals than $GME and $AMC: The poor fundamentals obviously bothered a lot of people who wanted to buy $GME and $AMC. But in comparison, if you dig into Tilray's financials, it is significantly better. Especially the cash balance. Mostly importantly, Tilray's product lines are diversified and they are currently still growing (this is a big thing for any business), especially in the international markets.
3. Its already primed: If you dig around Reddit, WSB, or even Stocktwits, you can see numerous people have already committed to baggage holding this stock. You are not too early and you won't be the only one to do so.
4. Harder for Management to Dilute the shares: As we saw previously, one of the challenges for the buyers of $GME and $AMC was battling against management's decision of stock dilution by the companies themselves. To put it in retard terms, diluting a stock is essentially printing more shares thus creating inflation in the stock so its harder to go up. Since Tilray is in the process of the acquisition by Aphria and it is an ALL STOCK deal via conversion ratio, it makes it harder for Tilray to implement dilution without significantly risking the deal.
5. Lightning can strike twice: A short-squeeze already happened in the past (2018) so you know the short-squeeze strategy already worked for this stock so it can work again. The brokers and exchanges are more prepared as their volatility risk models are already prepared to support significant high levels of volatility for this stock. Less chance for disruptions.
6. A means to an end: Lets be realistic, if you are holding $GME and $AMC right now, you will sell it. It could be tomorrow or it could be 3 years from now (If those companies are still in business) but you WILL sell it.  THAT is a very long time to hold baggage just to prove a point and you know the businesses you are holding suck from a business standpoint. Now since the Tilray and Aphia acquisition deal is on a timetable which will be completed sometime in the second quarter, that can be your exit time. You can go out gracefully if you choose to as you've already proven your point, made some money, and on the dawn of Tilray becoming a different company and under new management. For those of you choosing to keep those those shares post acquisition, how would you feel about holding shares to the largest Cannabis company in the world with good fundamentals, and on the dawn of full federal marijuana legalization? I would love it.
7. Great Symbolism: Lets face it, investing in a failing gaming company and movie theaters during a global pandemic doesn't really scream smart symbolic reform or via la revolution that well. But if you choose to focus on making a stand with a legal Cannabis company with a great future you can at the same time promote marijuana legalization and stick it to the hedge funds and dark capitalism at the same time. What better way to make a point to promote a great cause, symbiotic change, and at the same time make some money (If we are all on board).

Ok that's it! Kudos to you for making it to the end. Apologies for the long post but I really wanted to  get my points through. You all should obviously do your own due diligence and if you see what I see and the immense opportunity that is in front of us, and agree with my thoughts then lets do this!

BTW, if you are really retarded; I am NOT telling you to sell your $GME and $AMC. I'm only suggesting that we should start to look at other potential candidates for our short squeeze strategy to continue our cause of burning hedge funds and dark capitalism.

I just feel Tilray is such a great candidate for our cause and strategy especially with so much marijuana reform coming our way. We can make a greater point for a greater cause.

Thank you and trade well,

Title: GME urgent RE-EDUCATION - unify, clarify, focus and execute
How can I start this.. the paradigm that defines our role on GME needs urgent and drastic clarification  if we are to steer this thing back onto the road.Whether we want to admit it or not, we're fucking drifting atm. The hype is dying as all hypes do, the whole thing is glued with spit and running on pure randomness and doom inevitability ("we're all poor so we don't care, it's either moon or bankruptcy").

TH THA THA TH, time out.

Listen up fucktards, I'm poor too, but that's not the point. We need to go over the whole situation with perspective, and this is not some detailed nerd shit so it'll go easy on your 2 braincells.  


Repeat after me: we are not gonna trigger the short squeeze. WE ARE NOT GONNA TRIGGER THE SHORTSQUEEZE.  
It's easy to fall into disbelief by misunderstanding our part in all of this. We are not triggering shit, so all the retards YELLING buy buy buy every time it starts to go up need to come back to reality. It's NOT our job to trigger the short squeeze nor would we be able to.  


Picture a roman colosseum (an old stadium you mongs). In the middle of the arena, down in the pit you have all the shorters doing their thing, having a jolly good time. There's several tunnels surrounding the pit and leading OUT to freedom. 

To get the short squeeze we need them right there in the pit, so that's done. They're already there, shorting GME to shit, not by 13% which was enough to rocket VW share price 5X back in 2008, but by a staggering 50% to 130% (numbers irrelevant, point is the ammo is more than enough). As you can see there's plenty of shorters in the pit, so they're confident and comfortable.

  
Now, for the shortsqueeze to work you need 2 things:

\- a boogeyman  
\- something blocking the goddamn exit  


The boogeyman is ANYTHING that makes them fear for their billions and run for the exit trampling each other on the way out. The less shares available for them to cover their shorts the smaller this boogeyman can be, because they will panic knowing they may not be able to cover at all, meaning THE END.   
It could be literally a thousand different things, and the longer we go into the future the more likely that something will HIT. Could be someone scooping up an extra slice of the company (Ryan Cohen for example), earnings blowing out, anything. And this company has received SO MUCH free advertising in the last few weeks it's not unreasonable to think that they are at a historic turning point (not gonna get into the reasons why it's already a great value investment), and it will soon show.  


THEN, we come.  
We, the group of INDIVIDUALS that happen to be investing in the same stock because we like it.

What are we? We are bodies.  
Pilling up.  
On the fucking exits.

The more shares you own the fatter you are, and the fatter you are the more space you take up on the exit. And my friend my friend, the hedgies are REALLY gonna need the exit when the boogeyman shows up.  


Our role here is to buy as many shares as we can in order to clog the exit doors, so that the shorters have no way out when a boogeyman comes.If something big drops and there's not enough unflinching share ownership (buyers that won't sell no matter what), then the shorts will just make their way out and fuck all will happen.

Sure, there must be a lot of individuals and institutions unwilling to sell to bail shorts if they need to cover, say most of the GME board for example and maybe a couple institutions, but likely not nearly enough.

That's our part. If say half the people on WSB buy an average of 5 shares, that would be nearly 20 million shares. That's nearly 1/3 of the total GME shares available.If say, over a month we are able to turn that average into 10 per person, half of WSB would own a staggering 60% of all the shares, and you may say oh well that's not possible BUT JUST THINK ABOUT IT, many among us have investments in the hundreds of thousands, some even millions. Each one of those can bring the average up a hell of a lot.Heck, even I with my 20 shares god bless them, can make up for 3 people on WSB that bought nothing.  


Time really is on our side, if we just keep gobbling up shares we can really block those exits for the shorts, and when the time comes they will panic because they will realise there simply aren't enough shares to cover - GME goes straight to the MOON.

We don't need to worry at all, there is no losing here because mathematically it's a time bomb.THIS WILL NOT SURVIVE ON HYPE.HYPE IS NOT OUR FRIEND.Understanding the situation and calmly and patiently executing is how we can succeed.  


We need to unify, clarify, focus and execute.  


&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR -**

**The GME gang is losing its way because its all hype now. Hype will kill this because hype dies.We need to clarify our role and execute with patience. We don't trigger short squeezes, our function is to accumulate as many shares as possible so that when the time comes and something big and positive drops, the shorters try to cover but can't because we have all the stock (or most of it), they panic and GME moons.Basically the only thing that matters is to keep accumulating as many shares as you can, and to understand your role. This diamond hand shit is NOT needed because the price is irrelevant, it's the inevitable math of the short squeeze that matters and that's where the focus needs to be.**  


&amp;#x200B;

Obviously this isn't financial advice and everyone here does whatever the fuck they want anyways.

Title: Why BB and GME are diamond hands and have huge potential
BB is a solid company transitioning to being a software only company, see the following post from r/stocks \--&gt; [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lb92ma/blackberry\_dd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lb92ma/blackberry_dd/)

Now to the main subject GME is still an undervalued treasure. I know it seems like it might be overvalued because of the euphoria around GME these past two weeks, and how the media (and even some folks on wsb) try to portray it as a bubble, which it isn't.

1. Its a company with around $6 billions in annual revenues, and a new set of innovative leaders (Cohen and friends) who have a track record of turning companies into money printers (Chewy Inc now worth over $44 billion, was first losing money and bringing less than $26 million in revenue).
2. Its growing its E-commerce side by a whooping 254% (25% of all revenue was form online sales last quarter). Source --&gt; [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/08/2141775/0/en/GameStop-Reports-Third-Quarter-Results-A-Positive-Start-to-Fourth-Quarter-with-November-Comparable-Store-Sales-Increasing-16-5-And-Sustained-Progress-Toward-Long-Term-Strategic-Obj.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/08/2141775/0/en/GameStop-Reports-Third-Quarter-Results-A-Positive-Start-to-Fourth-Quarter-with-November-Comparable-Store-Sales-Increasing-16-5-And-Sustained-Progress-Toward-Long-Term-Strategic-Obj.html)
3. The future is bright, those that can weather the storm will reap the fruits and tendies that GME and BB have to offer.

As requested by a retard, my positions below (I got multiple trading accounts with different brokerages, this is one of them)

https://preview.redd.it/oqmdzv4417f61.jpg?width=1057&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0c49e6e5e85f6530a65ba406218c1226cc58d19

Title: DO NOT BUY CALLS IN MARGIN ACCOUNT !!!
It's obvious that stocks like GME and AMC are prime targets for short sellers who want to bring the price down.

Collusion between RH, prime brokers and the DTC can potentially damper the effects of the short squeeze because of loose and unsanctioned SEC rules regarding Regulation SHO that governs short selling, and in this case, [failures-to-deliver](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm).

If you have a margin account, brokerages do not need your permission to lend your exercisable shares if you buy a call or sell a put. This is their way of temporarily creating shares out of thin air, aka counterfit shares. While you wait for expiration date, brokerages keep a tab of all its customers' "lendable shares" and sends it to the DTC in this thing called the share borrowing program. The DTC will then lend those to other brokerages whos customers just bought a call option that is essentially a naked call initiated by the seller. Now while this call option remains open, since it's a naked short, the shares get to be lent again into another new naked short in a other brokerage, in **an ever-perpetuating cycle that results in a temporary increase of the number of total shares traded**.

This trick hedge fund use is called Continuous Net Settlement (CNS), and there are many other ways for shortsellers can manipulate the stock price, inclusing Ex-clearing and Fails-to-deliver strategies.

So if you buy a call or sell a put from a margin account, you're essentially allowing the number of total shares to grow artificially which makes the price go down!!!

Plus, these created shares cannot be accounted for, but in most cases, undiscoled short shares typically represent 20 to 50 times the number of failures-to-deliver (which is the only metric the SEC tracks).... that's HUGE!

Title: NOK Stock go Brrrr 
Heres why NOK stock is an undervalued long:

So before the downvotes just rub those two brain cells of yours together for a minute to focus on this for the next three minutes. (Fuck you I know what I said)

Due to all of the paper handed bitches, hedge funds shorting, and just general fuckery at the hands of retail trading apps, particularly robinhood, NOK is currently on MASSIVE discount.  Why do I say that? Because the fine folks over at DNB markets, Norways leading investment bank, have raised its stock valuation to 4.80, or for those of us who speak freedom, $5.80.

Why does that matter? I hear you starting to ask. Well it matters because its currently trading at only $4.53. 

There is over a dollar of pure value just waiting to be claimed. Not to mention it is expecting a very strong earnings report that can cause that value to go up even more. O and the company had been vocal about wanting to start its dividend payments back up. This earnings report should put them on the map for a lot of people. Im buying more tomorrow, see yall in space.


TLDR: worst case I make $1 per share as it goes up back to its evaluated price, or I until it hits $10 a share as its 5G grows in the coming years. 

Im not giving investment advice and no one should take this as such. Just did some research and wanted to share.

This was NIOs 6th consecutive month of sales growth, and theyve now delivered 82,866 vehicles. They continue to outperform Xpeng and Li Auto, BUT are still trailing behind Papa Elon. So who gives a shit? *YOU should.* 

NIO is *only up 5%* over the past month, lagging and consolidating behind the broader market. Despite the fantastic delivery numbers AND the corresponding increase in EV market share, the share price DROPPED 2% today. Reminder that Pooh Bear J-Ping wants **25% of all new cars sold in the country to be electric by 2025**. NIOs continual market share growth into *the* largest EV market in the world is literally an unmatched opportunity, with Chinas EV sales [expected to top 1.8 MILLION THIS YEAR](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/upcoming-catalyst-could-move-chinese-213553234.html). It has almost completely retraced its price back to its pre-NIO Day levels, suggesting that its ready for a breakout. No, literally [go look at its chart right now.](https://imgur.com/a/dtPsHVb)

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to deliveries, NIO is rumored to be looking to **expand into Europe** with its SUVs. *THIS MAY BE THE LAST ENTRY POINT BEFORE THE RUN-UP AFTER EUROPE EXPANSION PLANS* Theyve also recently released their first sedan model and are expanding their Battery as a Service infrastructure throughout China. It also goes without saying that having active backup from your authoritarian country is VERY helpful.

Title: Raytheon RTX and the new Air defense Platform
Raytheon has been down big most of  2020. Huge upswing post election . 

EPS out preformed projection of 0.70 EPS. Barely with 0.74 EPS. 

https://www.defensenews.com/land/2018/06/28/us-armys-interim-short-range-air-defense-solution-crystallizes/

In the above article you see the outline of the new Air defense platform the army has purchased. It shoots Raytheon Stinger missiles.  It also shoots Lockheed Hellfire missiles. Some varients can shoot raytheon lockheed co-developed Javelin missile. Some have been delivered. To EUCOM first for NATO Air Defense missions, with more ordered for more Army units that haven't even been created yet. 

In 2012-2014 the army did an audit to determine that Short range Air defense was majorly deficient in numbers and capabilities. There is demand for their services. And they do other things besides missiles. Like CIWS and LPWS.

u/PlatNoFeatures has done some great DD on the stock and that got me looking into it.

I am retarded. I did really good on the whole AMC and GME craze, got cocky, and fucked up everything on horrible calls with no research. Well I wont do that again. Now Ill fuck up money while doing lots of research so I have no excuse and feel even shittier.

I wont go into the DD Plat already did, check this for that: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwo5p5/callaway/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwo5p5/callaway/)

Any way, as you can see from this fucking crayon drawing, now is a good time to buy ELY. The blue curvy line is not just a representation of my floppy dick, but also the 21 adaptive EMA moving average. Stonks love moving average and its about touching now so buy it might be gud idea. It might dip a little below I guess, the average is not a fucking time machine or a crystal ball.

Since December there has been support at around 22-23 dollars, and the resistance is obviously at 30 right now. High end price target is $40 with earnings coming up.

Now im new and obviously retarded so like...my crayon drawing probably doesnt mean shit but stonks supposedly love the average and we arent way above or below right now. I am highly considering selling everything im bag holding, which will come out to between 700-800 if I sold everything tomorrow no matter what lol and going in on calls.

Thats obviously not a big move for shares and I want to build the base up so calls it will most likely be. I have one 2/19 $31c right now at $1.39 premium. Probably go for 30s if I yolo on this. I know its small money for now, fuck you im paying tuition.

One thing that is concerning is volume is low, but if wsb autists get on board, maybe we can do something.

Looking at RSI on the bottom and comparing to price vs average in the next pic, we see that it doesnt appear to be overbought right now, further indication to try and get in around or slightly lower than todays close

This is obviously not financial advice. Someone convince me to fuck off at 50% loss of initial investment on GME and AMC (including 2/19 calls for AMC) and go all in on this instead.you fuckers would love to see me blow up the account anyway.

Title: Amarin DD
The company name is thought to mean everlasting or from the sea depending on who you believe. Both are quite right. Vascepa is icosapent ethyl... a purified and modified omega-3 that when taken on top of a statin (think Lipitor) basically cuts your risk of dying, having a heart attack, or a stroke by 25%. 
Sounds good right? Lipitor was the best selling drug of all time until Humira. Yet it started out slow in its first year just like Vascepa...and without a pandemic. Now we have generic statins with hundreds of millions of patients worldwide taking daily. Lipitor had its run though. Just ask Pfizer. And it still sells tons of cabbage. But there is only one Vascepa that reduces your triglycerides and reduces your cardiovascular risk. Funny thing is...its not the triglyceride reduction that bestows the benefit......more later......Less stokes, stents, open heart bypass surgery....and DEATH!!! 

There are many different oils, or properly called fatty acids, in those over the counter omega-3s you may take. But only this particular one has been shown in double blind randomized trials to Work. At least two of the others, DHA and DPA likely actually hurt!!!!! No one really knows why. We think its its powerful anti-inflammatory properties of 100% icosapent ethyl or EPA (Vascepa). 
Think.....it coats the insides of your arteries and puts out the fire connected to the ticking time bomb. For reference see the New England Journal of Medicine article from 2018 called the REDUCIT study. Also see the EVAPORATE study from 2020 that showed coronary artery plaque regression. Thats right...Vascepa likely is liquid draino for your coronaries!!!! 

Let that sink in a minute. There are two large Covid-19 studies reporting in first half of this year called MITIGATe and PREPAREIT. Prepare-It will likely read out end of Feb. Mitigate interim around May. The thought is the anti inflammatory power of V helps. One Canadian study presented in December at the national lipid association showed statistics better than Remdesivir. Vascepa may snuff out the cytokines storm that kills you from Covid!!!! 
It may also disrupt the viruses transmissibility as covid is wrapped in...you guessed it...fatty acids and lipids. 
Let that sink in a minute. 

Amarin won the FDA approval for CVT reduction in Dec 2019. She hit $26 soon after. March 30, 2020 a Nevada judge was hoodwinked into overturning the patents of the original label for treating only patients with triglycerides over 500 to treat pancreatitis, thus potentially allowing generics to entreat themselves to AMARINs three billion a year US market (when mature..we only a year in). More than 90% of Vascepa scripts are for the cardiovascular indication...not for the skinny label treatment of triglycerides...for pancreatitis. The money is in the CVT risk reduction...i.e...the statin patients world wide. AMARIN spent nearly a billion dollars bringing this indication to market. And now generics want to try and steal it all. So far so good except for the market perception. AMARIN claims to have the API sources secured. 

Thus far there is one generic made by HICKMA. The company that won the court case. Litigation is still ongoing and AMARIN is now suing them for infringing on the CVT indication patents that are still quite valid. Damages could be huge!!!! 

Amarin won EU recommendation for the CVT indication in Europe on Friday and can start marketing likely by April. Europes market is maybe 50% larger than the US. Thus far Amarin has maintained the US market with Hickma currently holding 6% of the market. Yet the stock cratered from $26 to $4 in March. Today she sits just over $8. The drop was likely because all thought the US market was completely toast. Clearly it is not 4 months post generic launch. Add to this that Lovaza still makes up a large part of the prescription omega-3 market and there really is no good reason to ever take Lovaza now that Vascepa is here, and you can see that AMRNs revenues are going to be huge. Last year was unaudited $611 mill. 1 billion tax loss carry over. 550 million in cash or investments. No debt. Zero debt...... Price currently $8.25 

There seems to be a lot of selling between entities to ladder step her down almost daily since the March debacle. Despite that she has doubled. That the company updated its Change of control package and policy in an 8-k filed this Friday, one day after European approval recommendation could mean a Buy Out is imminent. Amarin was built for a buy out. She a one drug pony, but the drug is a doozy. I truly believe US can generate $1 bill in sales. EU $3 billion a year. Approval in China by Amarin partner could generate $5 bill a year but AMARIN gets a straight high teens royalty from Eddingpharm ( the Chinese owned partner) 

Long story short, this drug saves lives and WILL make a lot of money. Last I looked there were 22 mill shares short. With float of 386 million but much more than half the float is locked up. The daily shenanigans need to stop. The respect and eyes of the world needs to be on Vascepa!!!! Its truly a lifesaver with untold uses and benefits. I honestly believe there is a huge covid benefit to being on Vascepa and we will soon know. Lets see what happens when the PEOPLE get behind a company that has been screwed over and over yet gets back up again because the science of the drug is a once in 50 years proven scientific discovery. I bet she deservedly goes gangbusters and MOST IMPORTANTLY ....then HOLDS her gains. There wont be a find a chair when the music stops here. 
Your consideration is appreciated.

Title: Why it might not be best to buy the dips for GME:
Right now we are in trench warfare. The shorts and WSB (with some whales and institutional supports) are fighting neck and neck, but why? 

The shorts want to bankrupt GME, we know that wont happen because this company has Ryan Cohen as ceo. 

The shorts want to bring the price down as low as they can, but we keep buying the dips. If Im honest, THE SHORTS ARE WINNING RIGHT NOW, but the short interest is still high, so they have to cover. 

#WE ARE SPENDING OUR CAPITAL BUYING THE DIPS, WHEN WE SHOULD HOLD OUR SHARES NOW, LET THE PRICE TANK, THEN BUY UP EVEN MORE SHARES 

Would you rather buy 3 shares for 80 a piece, just for the shorts to attack again tomorrow and the next day, day after day, or do you want to let them win, let the price tank, then buy up even more shares before they can cover? 

Spending 240 on 3 shares, or spending 240 on 24 shares at 10$ a piece WHILE eating up the available shares? I know which one sounds better to me. 






#THE SHORTS PLAN 


Theres a very plausible theory that the shorts want to bring the price down very cheaply, then they will buy far OTM calls, and trigger the squeeze themselves. Then once at the top theyll buy puts and tank the price again. 


This allows them to 

#Cover 

#Make money on the upswing 

#Make money on the downswing 

#Possibly erase all of their losses and retain their investor base 



#TLDR: let the shorts drive the price down, DONT BUY THE DIP, just hold your shares you have now. And with your remaining capital watch the price tank, then snatch up 10x the amount of shares you would be able to during a normal dip.


#PLAY INTO THEIR HAND AND LET THEM THINK THEYVE WON AND THAT WE GAVE UP. THEN THATS WHEN SHARES BECOME AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE TO SNATCH UP CHEAPLY.

Title: $CLOV
I read Bidens National Strategy for the covid-19 response and pandemic preparedness. Theres a ton of language in there about strengthening essential data systems. There is also an acknowledgment that such task may require new technology.

Some relevant language from strategy:

Directs relevant federal agencies to collect, produce, share, analyze, and collaborate with respect to data supportive of COVID-19 response and recovery efforts.

Assist localities that struggle with public health infrastructure challenges that limit effective reporting or managing of COVID-19 data. The federal government will focus on states and localities that continue to struggle with antiquated data systems, especially jurisdictions that have trouble connecting testing laboratories and public health agencies to support case investigation, contact tracing, and support services for isolation of potentially exposed individuals. The federal government will work to surge personnel to assist with manual processes
in the near-term and develop data technologies to automate in the long-term.

Where is all this new technology coming from? 

In comes CLOV:

THE CLOVER ASSISTANT 

You have the exclusive opportunity to use Clovers technology, the Clover Assistant. The Clover Assistant is designed by doctors for doctors to help enhance patient care and reduce administrative burden. We take advantage of Clover Healths expansive data platform to deliver actionable and clear information, taking into consideration unique, patient-specific clinical data, needs, and circumstances. With a personalized design that focuses on proactive care, the Clover Assistant synthesizes and analyzes each patients information and makes real-time, personalized, dynamic, evidence-based recommendations right at the point of care.


ALSO read around and found that there have been a few bills introduced in congress over the past few months around data and privacy related to health. 

What do I think?

1. Biden = healthcare and hes looking to score big there. This will be a focal point. You know ThE fIrSt 1o0 dAyS

2. The language in Elizabeth Warrens bill is super specific about protections on how patient data is stored, anonymized, and shared. Okay... 

3. Pharmacys partner up with fed for covid vaccination and the day before clover issued a statement around getting covid vaccines. 


4. Now all of that sounds great. However, why the sudden rush to introduce bills that are clearly addressing a concern around patients health data? It raises all sorts if questions for me like:

Whos collecting this data that youre so worried about its use and privacy?

Where are these concerns coming from? What is it that we are protecting ourselves from? Is that not weird yall? Anyway, I guess the point there is that there is clearly some big push to collect and use our patient data by the government (pretty scary imo). Plus you know, google backed Clover. Which leads me to believe, based on the language around new technology in Bidens initiative, that they are going to have to acquire this technology from somewhere. Where from though? 


Anyway, Im excited to see how this narrative plays out in the coming weeks and months. Healthcare is a heavy political space, especially under Biden. Based on recent news, something is brewing. Too many coincidences lining up.

Title: Let's talk about taxes: both realized gains and realized losses (USA only)
I know everybody is getting super excited about GME, AMC, NOK, or BB going , but have you thought about taxes? I am not a tax advisor, but I did some research and wanted to make you guys aware of these things before the next tax season comes around and your jaws drop because Uncle Sammy wants a cut of your tendies.

**LET'S START WITH CAPITAL LOSSES:**

I know a handful of you do not care if you end up holding the bag. But also consider this: you can use these losses to **REDUCE YOUR TAX BILL**. You can only do this if you do not have any capital gains or your capital losses is greater than your capital gains for the year (you have more losses than gains). Unfortunately you can **only deduct up to $3,000 per year** ($1,500 if married filing separately), so please don't risk more than you can afford. If you do happen to lose more than $3,000, I suggest only selling some shares at a time each year (probably around December) up to a loss of $3,000. The deduction used to be $4,000 so it can change year to year. **(Please see edit below for losses &gt;$3,000).**

**CAPITAL GAINS (WHEN YOU COLLECT YOUR TENDIES):**

There are two different capital gains you can realize after you sell your shares: short term (&lt;=1 year) and long term (&gt;1 year).

Short term gains are taxed as ordinary income. What does that mean? It's essentially added together with your salary.

**Marginal Rates:** For tax year 2021, the top tax rate remains 37% for individual single taxpayers with incomes greater than $523,600 ($628,300 for married couples filing jointly). The other rates are:

* 35%, for incomes over $209,425 ($418,850 for married couples filing jointly);
* 32% for incomes over $164,925 ($329,850 for married couples filing jointly);
* 24% for incomes over $86,375 ($172,750 for married couples filing jointly);
* 22% for incomes over $40,525 ($81,050 for married couples filing jointly);
* 12% for incomes over $9,950 ($19,900 for married couples filing jointly).
* The lowest rate is 10% for incomes of single individuals with incomes of $9,950 or less ($19,900 for married couples filing jointly).

Long term gains follow a different set of rules as follows:

These are just general information. Please consult with a tax advisor as everyone's financial situations are different.

Also: there's a handful of you making donations which is freaking awesome. You should save those receipts as those donations can also be used to deduct your taxes. I currently cannot find info that would make sense (I guess I'm just as retarded as everyone else here). *(Edit: This only applies if you do an itemized deduction. Too lazy and complicated for me unless you have a smart tax advisor)*

If you got anything else I should add or inaccuracies in these info, I'll be sure to edit them. If this doesn't get approved as a post, then I just wasted the last few hours researching and typing this up.

***Full Disclosure: I am not a tax advisor. I'm as retarded as most of you and probably planning on taking advantage of the tax deduction if I end up holding the bag because*** ****.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 1: Net **capital losses** in excess of $3,000 can be **carried forward** indefinitely until the amount is exhausted. Due to the wash-sale IRS rule, investors need to be careful not to repurchase any stock sold for a **loss** within 30 days, or the **capital loss** does not qualify for the beneficial tax treatment.

Title: How to prevent your $GME shares from being used for short ladder attacks
Fellow apes:

Thanks to [a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb6aiq/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_03_2021/glt6vxo?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) from /u/Guildish, I was prompted to look into how to prevent my $GME shares from being used by hedge funds for the short ladder attacks we've been seeing these past couple days. Our brokerages are allowed to lend out our shares as long as there are no open orders on them. So, put a daily sell limit order on all of your shares (at a reasonable 3x-4x the price that day) so that they can't be lent out. A website I also found helpful information from:

[https://www.contracts-for-difference.com/borrowing-lending-shares.html](https://www.contracts-for-difference.com/borrowing-lending-shares.html)

Stay strong, buy the dips, and hold, fellow retards!

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I just like the stock. I am a retard and please do your research.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I am not advising anyone. I bought 15 shares at \~$290 last Wednesday, and tomorrow I'm putting my daily sell limit order at $5k lmao. And probably buying more tomorrow!

Edit 2: Ive noticed my email shows some comments that look like they didnt make it through due to new accounts/low karma, but Ill try to answer the genuine questions through edits. Someone asked what platform I am using, and I use Vanguard. Ive never had any issues with them, and they dont limit how many $GME or $AMC shares I can buy.

Edit 3: Buying stocks with Vanguard is pretty straightforward. If you need help, feel free to PM me. Someone mentioned that the short ladders cause a placement of an artificial ceiling, meaning huge gains cant be made. Im not an expert by any means whatsoever, but if you look at the 2008 VW squeeze chart, that proves not to be true. Also, someone mentioned TD Ameritrade is limiting the sell limit. Go as high as it will let you, and if you dont feel comfortable with that, its okay. If worse comes to worst, get a Vanguard account, buy shares through them, and set your sell limits to the stars.

Edit 4: Do not buy your shares on margin! A few of you have let me know that shares bought with cash accounts cannot be used for short attacks. Not sure if you all can see their comment, but /u/Germanicusss has advised to pay down your margin debt and/or instruct your broker to move the shred into your cash account. I need to do more research into that. Another reminder that this is not financial advise and Im not an expert. For those of you telling me (with malicious intent) that Im a retard, tell me something I dont know.

Title: I spent some time looking into Failed to Deliver. Hopefully, this is some useful information for all of you!
So the SEC has a failed to deliver report under the FIOA

[https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)

It looks like it only updates this data bi-monthly for the 1-15 16-30th  and the next report is due out at or around the 15th.  I am going to call the SEC tomorrow and ask for intermediate data.  We need this data NOW.  If you look at this.  GME has failed to deliver a LOT of shares all the time.   When I did some highschool excel Data Analytics on it.  It is the 60th stock on the list when sorted by # of shares.

From the SEC regarding this data

&gt;"The  figure is not a daily amount of fails, but a combined figure that includes both new fails on the reporting day as well as existing fails.   In other words, these numbers reflect aggregate fails as of a specific   point in time, and may have little or no relationship to yesterday's   aggregate fails."

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/it8azv8we6f61.png?width=611&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df3aeba99ac700b17d6f8f676ef390316376ee59

Looking at the above site.  There are links to information about Failed to deliver.[https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm)

Is GME considered a Threshold Security 

&gt;In  order to be deemed a  threshold security, and thus subject to the  restrictions of Rule  203(b)(3), a security must exceed the specified  fail level for a period  of five consecutive settlement days.   Similarly, in order to be removed  from the list of threshold  securities, a security must not exceed the  specified level of fails for  a period of five consecutive settlement  days.

Does the Firm have to close out the positions? 

&gt;As adopted, Rule 203(b)(3) requires any participant of a registered clearing agency ("participant")[80](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P210_72014) to take action on all failures to deliver that exist in such securities ten days after the normal settlement date, *i.e.*, 13 consecutive settlement days.[81](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P211_72496)Specifically, the participant is required to close out the fail to   deliver position by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rule 203(b)(3) is intended to address potential abuses that may occur with large, extended fails to deliver.[89](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P221_79239)  We believe that the five-day requirement will facilitate the identification of securities with extended fails.

So  Dumb-ass me looked further back in time to the second half of  December.  It looks like GME has been failing to deliver CONSTANTLY.   This means that there are shares that Brokers HAVE to buy.  We are over the 10/13 Day limit.  What's going on here.  How can this single security CONSTANTLY fail to deliver almost every day... clearly something is going on here....  How are they CONSTANTLY failing?  Well,  that's because there are shares that are made up, it has to be.  This is shorted STILL beyond belief as of the 15th.

Title: $HSY Valentines Run Up?
Would love some feedback here. I was looking at Hershey and comparing last year. They ran up from $145 at the end of January to $160 by Feb 14. 

Retail food sales have been huge all year with big YoY sales. It stands to reason that their sales for the Valentines Day holiday are going to crush last year. Their earnings report is Thursday. Most big box retailers placed their Valentines Day orders weeks if not months ago. So this should show up on their revenue.

Title: Can someone with a knowledge of prob/stats and portfolio risk management explain to me how two days of volume led DTCC to increase RH's deposit requirement by 10x?
I know this isn't exactly a WSB type of post, but there has to be someone with expertise doing some bedtime reading.  [Here is a blog entry](https://stu2b50.dev/posts/why-robinhood-d3580b) attempting to explain the calculation.

As far as I understand, the situation is like this.  RH needs to maintain an amount of cash (maybe with DTCC, but possibly just separately within RH since they have their own clearing house) that, with 99% probability, will cover the entirety of the cash needed to cover their unsettled T+2 positions.  This is generally much smaller than the actual buy volume on a given day because the amount that's due two days later is max(vol_buy - vol_sell, 0).  Let's call this the net buy volume (NBV).  In a situation where RH is buying and selling in an unbiased way, this would be on the order of sqrt{vol_buy} since sell proceeds offset buy proceeds (not for a particular symbol, but *across the entire portfolio*).

It seems highly unlikely to me that most of the buy volume on Tues/Wed last week was from cash, and not also from sale of equities.  And, moreover, if it was from cash, then in order for the NBV to remain high, it would require a constant influx of cash into RH accounts.  Therefore I assume that the massive increase in deposit requirements actually came from the "99%" requirement and a massive increase in the estimated variance of the NBV on DTCC's part.

But the fucking situation is not symmetrical.  If RH did suddenly adopt a huge net long position (due to users primarily buying $GME), then the volatility to the *sell side* becomes huge, but not the volatility to the buy side.  But a huge move to the sell side is not risky to DTCC.  They want more deposits to protect the net buy side.  This isn't modeled by a normal distribution because the only way to keep having massive NBV is for users to keep depositing proportional equity (since selling other equities to buy $GME cancels out).

Of course, DTCC knows this, but it seemed like they had RH over a barrel, and if they could depress buying to limit their own exposure, that was a fortuitous consequence.

Finally, why didn't RH then adopt this position:  You could only buy $GME with equity from selling other shares.  This would make that user's contribution to the net buy volume zero.  It would also mitigate the problem of $GME causing an increase in the net buy volume.  And, moreover, it would have drastically lessened the manipulative effect on the markets, allowing people to mostly keep buying $GME.

According to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.

**Growth Strategy**

Move into the Asia Pacific region:

The Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.

Complimentary acquisitions:

Corsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.

New Markets:

Uses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.

**Threat of New Entrants**

Because of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).

**Threat of Substitution**

A significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsairs business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.

Cloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-users system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.

According to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.

Additionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.

**Moats**

There does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsairs market share across their product offering.

**Other Relevant Risks**

Due to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.

Title: $NNDM DD
$NNDM is a defense contractor (read that as safe money) that provides machines to fabricate in house secure electronic components.

While earnings have missed for the past year, liquidity remains good at 2.23 and a cash ratio of 0.89. Cash and equivalents are around 45M. Solid numbers like this mean they could operate at a loss for a considerable amount of time. https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NNDM/financials

They have contracts with Israel (God knows they spend some money on defense), France, and a single company fixed price contract with the US Army. I am sure there are more, but this data gets a little squirrelly to find. 

They have a solid history of up and down trading with support currently sitting around 12, resistance around 16 making it a good long term or swing trade indicated by a combination of MACD and RSI. Currently on an upswing from around $14. Possible bull flag near market close, so be aware of that if you plan an entry. 

Lots of upside potential, long term I believe this stock will be going 20+

Title: $BB is a good company
  

Listen up retards,

I know BlAcKbErRy make phones is a solid meme, but I think it is actually a very worthwhile investment regardless of the current hype (or lack thereof) around the stock.

BlackBerry Spark was launched just earlier last year and so far is winning some decent contracts. I think it has plenty of room to grow. As governments and countries start to connect more with the internet due to covid or just technology advancing cybersecurity solutions will be more relevant. I think BB has positioned itself to be a solid choice.

The United States Airforce in September selected BlackBerry Spark for their secure productivity needs.

They won the patent infringement lawsuit against Facebook, so that payout should be coming at some point. I know the stock already jumped because of the news, but still being able to uphold their patents means in the future they can sue more people for infringement and make more money.

Blackberry is out of the cell phone game which is good for them I think their software and security was really what made the phones popular to begin with so now they can focus more on that. (Also they are the largest patent holders in Canada not sure if that a really that important though)

While I dont think its going to be the rocketship I wanted it to be (I wanted it to be one so bad look at my comment history lol)  I do think its a sound investment and if you buy now you can earn some tidy profits. Earnings call is March 3rd so you autists can buy options for that Friday

But Im just a retarded ape so what do I know.

Not financial advice.

Edit: they have also partnered with Zoom. There is also a blackberry branded 5g phone coming out. (Blackberry isn't the company making it)

Edit2: Saw some talk about Ford ditching QNX but it looks like they will still support Sync (and Apple Car Play) in new cars so not sure how that's going to work

Last edit promise: No buying limits on $BB on any platform as far as I can tell.

Title: VW 2008, GME and you Autists
Alright you Apes listen. Gotta combat some of this shit.

I keep seeing so many posts around here about this squeeze and that the 2008 VW squeeze are totally the same. Or that in 2008 the VW squeeze happened with a much smaller short position. 

They are not the same full stop and the VW squeeze didn't have a smaller short position.

First and foremost I'm holding 9 shares at an avg cost of $352.00 I'm still in it but all the shit DD needs to stop. 

Sorry if this hurts your feelings.

So first and foremost just because they are both short squeezes does not mean they are going to behave the same. Part of the reason for this is the suprise and speed at which the VW squeeze happened to funds.

Second and the main part of this post. The short position was not actually smaller in VW. I'll explain. 

In 2008 the VW short squeeze happened causing VW to become the most valued company on the entire NYSE. The reason for this situation is similar to the current situation there were more shorts out than shares to cover. 

Now I already hear your stupid screeching "BUT IS WAS ONLY 12 PERCENT SHORT!!!"

Now I'm sure you had to kick off your shoes and socks to count that high and really I'm proud but here is the whole story.

Porsche had quietly bought nearly 75% of the company. This was done in a few sneaky ways but ultimately that's what happened.

Now before this there were only 45% of the shares available anyways due to Porsche having an existing 30% stake various index funds 5% and finally 20% covered by the german government.

To break it down 30+20+5 = 55% already owned. and 13 percent or so short.

Now let's add in Porsche's new stake 75+20+5=95%

And since these shares are now bought by people who have no interest or in some cases no ability to sell we there is a 13% short position on only about 5% of trading shares.

The final catalist was VW issuing a statement to the shorts letting them know they were super duper fucked. Like you forgot to pick up your wife's birth control and now your rasing her boyfriends son levels of fucked.

This caused the short squeeze from hell.

Now as to our current dilemma. Nothing is guaranteed to behave the same however if the shorts have not closed their positions sufficiently this might happen again. So good news for we big dick diamond hand fuckers if that is the case. But anyone who this is your first time at this shit know that you might be about to learn a painful fucking lesson that just because 2 similar things happen it doesn't mean shit.

That being said HOLD THE FUCKING LINE AND BUY THE DIPS

Title: A theory on hedges and a possible squeeze.
One theory I have been batting around my head. 

Due to the massive losses to the hedges. Why wouldnt a couple of hedges. Once they have covered. Start massively going long in order to start a massive squeeze to get rid of all the other hedges that are still short. (Still a large short interest) It would only take a small push I think from some big hedges to kickstart the perpetual upward rise.  Retail would join in. The whales are already in.  They would then bail when the squeeze is sqoze and their competition is gone. 

Why would they do this. 
1. It gets rid of the competition 
2. It minimises their losses from the previous shorts. If done right it could actually make them profit. 

Why wouldnt they do this
1. It would make retail think they won and were right.  Cant have the little guy declaring victory. Is pride more important than money to these despicable miscreants. 

If this is correct then those holding could be rewarded by the hedges.  It would also explain why there was $25m in $800 3/19 calls. 

$GME to the moon.  



*this should not be taken as financial advice. These are the ravings of a mad lunatic retard. 

Im holding. Not a lot but its all I could afford to lose.

Title: $GME compared to the VW squeeze in 2008.

Title: You guys are paper handing $GME because you haven't seen the squoze yet and are worried the company is worth nothing
 Most of you retards in GME got in when the stock already jumped several times from where it was 8 weeks ago. You're all shouting Wall St is preventing the MOASS through manipulative actions (they definitely are). However you're all losing sight of why the short squeeze was even possible in the first place and pissing your pants wetting your paper hands in the process.

**We didn't invest in GME because the shorts were over 140% of the float and wanted to punish Wall St**

If any of you autists actually did some DD or even watched some of DFV's videos, you'll realize that GME was a value play, *the short squeeze was just the cherry on top*. I have seen over the past two weeks, a huge gaslighting effort from billionaires on TV (and unintentionally reddit users pushing only the MOASS), getting you to believe that Gamestop's value is from the short squeeze. What everyone forgot is how valuable of a company Gamestop is now.

**So what changed about Gamestop?**

In Nov 2020 Ryan fking Cohen joined Gamestop's Board. Who is Ryan Cohen? This is the guy who built Chewy from the ground up, he was in all respects, able to build a Pet e-commerce empire and directly compete with **Amazon**. Not only did Ryan join the board, but he was able to bring along with him Chewy's COO/CMO and CFO. You know who else is on the board? Reggie Fils-Aim, the previous President of Nintendo Americas. If you don't know Reggie, you definitely know his face. So now you know Gamestop is poised for a shakeup, Ryan didn't join the Board and bring with him two other people because he thought Gamestop was going to get squozed, he did it because he understands there is a lot of money to be made here.

**Valuation**

I'm not going to pretend I'm an expert in valuing companies. Properly evaluating a company purely based on financials does not work in today's market anymore, but to appease the F people.

Here are some facts:

Critics argue brick and mortar retail, and as a result Gamestop, is dying. While they aren't wrong, they fail to also address that Gamestop had **300% YoY growth in e-commerce sales**. Gamestop is also actively shutting down stores and rebranding existing ones as experience centers. Physical Gamestop stores are going to be where all you autists hang out when you're outside of your rooms.

Gaming is huge, anyone who argues otherwise is living under a rock. As cringe as it was, Ninja hosting the NYC ball drop is testament to this. Singular game titles like Fortnite and Minecraft are worth billions alone. The gaming industry itself is worth nearly **$200 Billion** and slated to grow double digits YoY.

[There is a great DD written by a VC on why Gamestop is going to the moon](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/)

&gt;This market cap (matching industry standards) should for an appropriate valuation for a growth stock be $50B.....This is why the short squeeze is distracting many. In 5 years if you diamond hands this company, the fair value of shares can range from $800-$2400 and not be in any sort of bubble or unjustified by fundamentals speculation.

To repeat that, based on fundamentals alone (nothing to do with a short squeeze), GME per share could be worth $800 conservatively, or $50 Billion. Chewy at this time is worth roughly $40 Billion in a smaller market, Pet products vs Gaming.

So polish your paper hands and turn them into fking diamonds. There is nothing Wall St can do can make you sell. And when this company starts turning itself around, you'll have been at the ground floor. 

**TL:DR Gamestop not worth nothing if shorts not squoze. Everyone wants you to believe it so you can sell now. Gaming is huge, Gamestop is positioning itself to be big.** 

P.S. For all you retards, everyday you hold your shares is another day Melvin and co need to pay interest. Hold your stocks for at least a year, and you even get to pay long term capital gains tax as opposed to short term counts as ordinary income. (Read hold onto your shares for longer, less booboo from govt). Also this is why you don't fking buy on margin or play with options.

Title: Cohen still has the opportunity to buy another 7%. Seems like a great price to do so.
A while back I read a [VERY good DD Post](https://redd.it/l0czgs) by u/FatAspirations talking about how big of a player Cohen truly is in all of this. Given the massive red days we've seen twice this week I'd really recommend giving it a read. But the one point that's important, and point of this post is:

* Cohen still has a contract to buy another 7% of GME Shares

He currently owns around 13%, and is restricted to owning no more than 20% as part of an agreement. Obviously he wouldn't want to exercise that right when the price is $350, and he has until the end of 2022 to do it, but if he thinks $100 is the new Floor, or around there, wouldn't this be the best time for him to do so?

Every single one of his share purchases in the past have been about sending a message. Why not this one too?

Edit: 7% would equate to about 5M shares of a 70M Float, if my maffs right. But am retard.

Title: "I" need to disassociate DFV with this influx of Retail Investors and GME as a whole. And WSB needs to stop acting like the rampant mob mentality didn't get "me" here.
First off Positions: 115 @ $85 20@$300 avg I have less in this than a lot of people here. And I'm still holding, haven't dropped a single share. I'm not trying marginalize or kill morale but something needs to change.

&amp;#x200B;

That's fucking AWESOME that DFV is still in and is holding with his diamond dong, but first things first, he cashed out $13M along the way and has been very transparent on this. What's losing $20M if you're up $40M? 

&amp;#x200B;

DFV is why a lot of retail investors entered the market. DFV never intended for this to hit as high as it did and that's apparent in his positions, he thought GME was heavily shorted and had a lot of potential, but there's no way he thought it would lead to short squeeze 1k+ territory. 

HE IS NOT THE NUMBERS BEHIND THIS AND "I" NEED TO THINK FOR MYSELF

"I" need to stop making him a martyr for this sub for the day he eventually sells. The SEC is probably watching him like a hawk and I'm assuming that's a big reason that he's still in even though it's in his long play. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also the SWEEPING DOGSHIT MORALE needs to stop. This sub went from 

&amp;#x200B;

" BUY BUY BUY BUY EVERYONE BUY" 

to: 

&amp;#x200B;

"Wow everyone here has such high expectations you shouldn't be taking this unsatirically and you should only afford to play with what you lose." "Here's a gambling hotline" "Wow what a dumb play"

&amp;#x200B;

If that's not bots; that's the sub taking a shitty 180 at the first sign of real defeat and if "I" have any chance of seeing this through, "I" need to stay motivated, turn off the ticker, and check in at major mile markers to see where this is at.

&amp;#x200B;

"My" chance at a squeeze was last week but the weak ass SEC chose to turn a blind eye to it and everyone should be VERY CAUTIOUS OF ROBINHOOD/IB+ ANY OTHER BROKERS SITTING ON LESS THANT 1T RESERVES.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact? "I" NEED TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS NOW A FEW WEEK PLAY MINIMUM AS LAST WEEK WAS PULLED FROM "ME" SO GET OUT OF SMALLER BROKERS NOW.

&amp;#x200B;

SO STAY STRONG RETARDS AND SEE YOU IN THE HAMPTONS.

Title: Diamond Hands Listen Up! GME is on sale right now and will be going to the moon THIS week. The hedges played us so hard that they have played themselves.
\*\*TDLR at the bottom\*\*

First off, to all of you diamond handing this stock, god damn I love you apes.

Now listen up and listen closely. GME is still on a moon mission and its launch is imminent. I've seen some fantastic DD here that is far beyond my analytical skills and I thank you all for that because god knows I can't read so the charts help.

This break down is going to be consist of something we tend to lack here, and that my friends, is logic.

So lets get into it. 

This past week has seen GME hit an ATH followed by a steep decline due to market manipulation tactics and the media turning against us at presumably the hand of the hedge funds we stand to hurt the most. We have seen hit pieces on GME, misdirection, and blatant lies regarding the analytics and reporting of statistics on GME. Countless media outlets have claimed that GME has squeezed already and its over! Its done! Move on and move back in with your wife's boyfriend!

But they are wrong.

Think of this from a surface level and look at the big picture. This entire week was a setup for shorts to mitigate their losses which they knew they would incur regardless. First, we saw a price spike that opened up options far, far OTM.  Out to 800 fucking dollar calls. Then, we saw a steep decline in price along with a fundraiser for shorts in the form of SLV being pushed by shills. Following this we saw massive purchases of these OTM 800c yesterday once premiums and IV were reduced. So what does this mean? Hedges set themselves up to mitigate how much they'll lose in hopes of just avoiding bankruptcy while giving their associates a chance to profit even greater on the impending squeeze. 

Now why would it come this week if a lot of the calls are dated out to March you ask? Apparently, and I don't know this for fact, but Fintel will update GME's short interest officially as of next Tuesday, February 9th. If this is true, and short interest is still over 100%, this will confirm that media outlets were bought and paid for by hedges along with their misdirection, thus causing even further public outrage, and another mass buying of GME to get in on the squeeze that is still coming. 

However, if hedges knock the price down as far as possible and trigger the squeeze this week, they will have effectively hedged their bets with calls, shaken out as many paper hands as possible, and stopped delaying the inevitable, all while leaving the media outlets they paid off, now holding the metaphorical bag of lost public trust, all while mitigating their losses to the fullest extent. 

Essentially, if the short interest is still outstanding and above 100%, shorts would fuck themselves even further by allowing an official report of this to come out and they know it. 

We go the moon soon my fellow apes. Good luck and God speed. See you at 10,000.

This is NOT financial advice and I AM and APE.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Hedges have mitigated their losses and have screwed buyers and the media outlets they've bought. When official short interest reports come out, they'll be outed as liars and the retail retaliation will send us even further to the moon than if they just let it happen prior to these reports.

Title: I think the HF's are leaving the writers of the 800c 2/5 options as the bag holders.
Imagine you are an HF that shorted this stock to oblivion, and a bunch of retards come into a long position raising the price by 1000%. The interest rate on your shorts goes through the roof and you are about to go bankrupt. What do you do? First you up your fire power by bringing in funds. Then you vilify your enemies, telling the world that they are the problem, not you. Then you stop the squeeze by putting a throttle on demand side. Then you divert the money to side show securities that will actually raise your bottom line.  


What next? You still have to pay back the shares. You are not going to get it cheap. How do we limit it? I could buy cheap way OTM call options knowing that when we start to cover, the price is going to explode because the diamond handed apes won't be selling for cheap. How do you maximize this? 

1) you need a cheap OTM call. Since 2 weeks ago, the highest call was 160, and last week was 320, they weren't far enough out of the money to be cheap. 

2) to make it cheaper, you need it to look like the squeeze has squoze, and gain as many shares from paper hands on the way down. Lowering the price per share on the call options. 

3) purchase enough OTM calls to cover your short position after it explodes. Locking in your price to cover at 800 per share max.   


Proof:   
[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options/)  
Here we can see that there is a volume of 28,493 call options purchased. Holy shit...

That is 2.85 million shares. 2.28 Billion dollars worth at that strike price. 

With the volume of trades as it rises to that point, plus the volume of those calls, they could bring their short positions low enough to complete the squeeze.  


Who is left holding the bag? HF will mostly hold the bag. Seeing as they will be paying 2.28 Billion dollars at least. Then the real bag holders will be the writers of the call options. They will have to purchase the shares raising the price above 800 due to a gamma squeeze. 

TL;DR: I believe hedge funds have gotten rid of their risk of having to pay the 10k per share we think is reasonable to a max of 800 by purchasing way out of the money calls, and writers of call options will be the biggest bag holders in history.   


Guys I'm just a retard that has never professionally traded, I don't know shit about shit. I'm holding on to my stocks, and they will have to pry them out of my cold dead diamond hands. Don't listen to this. It's not financial advice.   


Please poke holes in this...I'm getting way too excited.

Title: [DD] heavy put option buying made GME go down today
As the title suggests,  just glancing at the option chain today you will see lots of put options being bought today. Feb 5 100p had the highest volume today at 22k with 7k OI, call volumes don't even compare. Like it or not in general people are bearish on the stock and the fact that 100P is now pretty deep ITM doesn't bode well for the stock. What we are experiencing is pretty much a gamma squeeze but downwards. 

That halt today was pretty bullshit because we were on the way up above 100  and an IV crush on OTM $100 puts would've given us some momentum upward. But no it just had to happen on the way up. 

Anyways this week looks pretty bearish and it is possible we could dump some more if we don't take back 100. I've been wrong before and I hope I'm wrong again. Keep diamond handing though, MM has been fucking with us by jacking up the price of options to make it harder for us to buy and profit from this. They can't do this forever and in fact, I've been profiting by selling OTM puts at great prices while holding onto my shares, I know theta gang isn't welcome here but what could be better than getting paid to hold gme at discount prices? or selling puts to expire worthless to GME bears?  

Anyways as soon as IV dies down, which could take a while, it's time to start buying YOLO  FD call options again. 

GME to 420.69 is my price target

Title: DD on Delta Airlines, Calls for Jan 2022
  

Listen up retards,

Many of you are probably looking for a new direction from which tendies may fly. Well do I have a solution for you. Its a big reverse course from the boomer dinner this sub ate over the past few weeks.

Yes my friends, I propose aggressive call options/long positions on the Airline industry, specifically Delta. Heres why:

Past:

\- Going back to a report by Forbes, [Delta ranks best](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurabegleybloom/2020/07/27/covid-report-best-worst-airlines-coronavirus/?sh=48b3b5ff13af) in terms of cleanliness during COVID, meaning prevailing sentiment among travelers is high right now.

Present:

\- Delta is the [last major airline not filling middle seats](https://news.delta.com/delta-only-us-airline-block-middle-seats-limit-onboard-capacity-through-march-30-2021#:~:text=Delta%20will%20continue%20delivering%20on,now%20through%20March%2030%2C%202021), thereby spacing passengers out. 

\- This is good because, again it improves customer safety/feeling of safety during flights

\- This also means that they have been seating fewer passengers throughout the pandemic, while total profits have remained largely equal with their major competitors

\- Tighter self-imposed restrictions may mean fewer international restrictions, but this is more speculative than anything

Future:

\- Expects to hit profitability by July

\- Pandemic expense cuts to older aircraft should present a $400m decrease to annual costs, even when considering a ramp up in overhead as traffic increases

\- Delta expects at least 70% of their large corporate clients to return by the end of the year

Those final 2 points are from their last earning call, which means well of course theyd be bullish on themselves, but if its to be believed, then Delta is ready to come out of the pandemic strong. With a mix of leisure travel skyrocketing, business travel returning to some extent, and the holidays leading to a traffic spike right in time for Jan 2022 calls, Im thinking of going hog deep in 65c at $1.61 a piece.

My main price suppressing factor is that [children aren't expected to receive the COVID Vaccine](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/children-coronavirus-vaccine-late-2021-experts/story?id=73364817) until late 2021. If children cant get the vaccine then families cannot travel. I'm banking a lot here on the vast majority of Americans getting the vaccine in time for Christmas. As a result my theory leads me to the Jan 2022 options, rather than the Sep ones, as the holiday rush will play out before they expire.

TLDR:

Plane no fly good now, but stock not so bad. When plane fly more, stock more better.

Title: If you sell now, you don't understand the core principal of trading.
Autist incoming. A lot of retards made their first trade with GME. Awesome and welcome!

With inexperience come a lot of psychological phallacies that Funds are exploiting:

# BUY LOW SELL HIGH.

*The. Core. Principal. Of. Trading.*

You never, ever sell when down. You don't. If you sell at loss you're literally **BUYING HIGH AND SELLING LOW!!!** If you don't 100% NEED this money RIGHT FUCKING NOW. Do. Not. Sell. It would be more entertaining literally burning money then selling at artificially low prices. NO ONE IS FORCING YOU TO SELL. If you're getting nervous about LOSSES ----&gt; DONT LOOK AT THE STOCK. DELETE YOUR APP. DO NOT GET STRESSED AND EMOTIONAL. You are not acting rationally when emotions get involved in trading. NEVER SELL EMOTIONALLY. Emotions are your enemy in trading and you WILL LOSE MONEY. If you're emotionally attached to your invested money, try avoiding any further trades until you're set up where you can (emergency fund, tax advantaged accounts etc. can help you feeling more secure).

It's negative today, it may be negative tomorrow. The DD still stands. GME as a company is in the spotlight of the world. It has a future.

Even if there will be no short squeeze. DO NOT SELL AT LOSS. WAIT. 1 year, 3 years, 10 years. WHATEVER. It can get green again. IT CAN AND IT MAY. If you sell at loss, it wont.

I KNOW THIS IS NO TYPICAL WSB (NON) ADVICE, BUT WITH SO MANY FUCKING RETARDS JUMPING IN WITH NO FUCKING CLUE WHAT THEIR DOING IT NEEDS TO BE SAID.

Some more autistic shit

# Percieved Value:

Remember when you bought your shares. Let's say you bought at $300. You made the decision that this stock, its potential and emotional value, is worth $300 to you and you bought.

Now the Price is artificially driven down. The beginning value hasn't changed. No one says that stock is worth less, unless you do. Unless you yourself decide that you're willing to sell at a lower price.

When selling at $100 -&gt; YOU ARE SAYING IT'S WORTH THIS LITTLE. YOU DECIDE AT WHAT PRICE YOU'RE WILLING TO SELL. If you don't WANT to sell at $100 WAIT TILL YOU CAN SELL IT TO FUCKING MELVIN AT $6000.

Plus: Loss Aversion

A loss of 10% is emotionally more powerfull than a gain of 10%. They are preying on this effect to bring you to make an emotional decision to PANIC and sell at loss. WHICH ONLY MAKES SENSE IF YOUR GOAL IS TO LOSE MONEY.

&amp;#x200B;

HOLD TODAY

HOLD TOMORROW

HOLD FOREVER

IF YOU NEED THE MONEY, WAIT FOR IT TO FUCKING TURN GREEN YOU IMBECILE.

&amp;#x200B;

THIS IS JUST A DELUSIONAL AUTISTIC FUCK SPEAKING AND NO FINANCIAL ADVICE.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:

Since WSB became a fucked up game of finding an imposter -&gt; I was active on WSB a while ago on a different account (MICRON, early AMD) and since moved to subs like /r/financialindependence /r/FIRE etc. and switched to low-cost index funds and mainly stick to this kind of investments and kept an eye on WSB for enterntainment. This account has since been deleted by me because friends of mine (and coworkers) got ahold of that accounts username. I had some history that was too personal for them to know about.

I only moved onto the GME bandwagon out of spite, the moment BUY's got blocked on RH. This is the only and last "WSB" move I'm gonna do. 

It doesn't have any meaning as I could write whatever, but my username is my job in the banking sector. I know people that work in HF's, used to work decades in HF's. I didn't quite believe what they told me about the possibilities they have. But now I do.

Buy low, sell high is the foundation of any trade you do. Even GME. 

If you thought this move would be a quick buck over a few days, no. If you bought after the surge, it just doesn't make ANY sense selling. NONE. You cut your potential of any breakeven, ever.

Even if the short squeeze wouldn't happen due to highly illegal tactics by HF, GameStop has way more potential now than before. The company is in international spotlight, has an easy way to raise capital after the trade still, has global logistics... It still has potential as a company, if you sell now, you lose out on any chance of ever covering that loss.

Title: Cannabis stocks have turned into STONKS - my smooth-brain DD
Listen here my fellow retards, my patience is running out on giving you free advice. I know short term meme stocks seem to be all the rage these days, but I believe the real tendies are being produced from the cannabis sector. 

MSOS (Cannabis ETF) is up 6% today and has already gone up \~25% on the year. Basically all the cannabis stocks have been exploding these past few months. I don't see this growth slowly down anytime soon and here are some reasons why.

* Both the **US and Mexico** are closing in on **federally legalizing cannabis**. Both of these countries are going to offer huge markets that will combine to be far bigger than Canada's current market.
* **More people are doing the 420**. Usage is going up everywhere and I don't see it dropping in the near future.
* Lots of cannabis companies are **getting majorly shorted** which is keeping their stock price down instead of going to the MOOOON 

Wouldn't be a fair DD without some risks though.....

* Although **US and Mexico** are strongly considering federal legalization, it **could still go south**. Backlash from legalizing or more important and pressing issues could easily push it to the back-burner or kill the idea all together for the near future.
* Although many health studies are coming out listing the benefits of cannabis, if some **serious health side-effects** come out in some studies it could scare people away from smoking the weed.
* There are far too many companies and lots of them are going to go **bankrupt** probably. Lots of room to get unlucky in your choices.

So what cannabis stonks should I be YOLOing into? A better first question might be: What should I be looking for in a cannabis stock?.

* **Profitable or near it:** Once the market really explodes it is going to be the companies with the cleanest balance sheets that are going to be able to make the big moves and print the real tendies. The companies with piles of debt and minimal profit will be left in the dust.
* **Has a foothold in multiple countries:** The more countries, states, licenses, land, etc., the better. All of these will allow for a head-start in the markets in that area.
* **Undervalued:** with lots of the cannabis stocks getting shorted to death, there are some cannabis stocks out there that I believe are extremely undervalued.

So what are your recommendations Mr. Smooth Brain?

* **APHA:** Tilray and Aphria are in the works of a serious and huge merger that will see them becoming one of (if not the biggest) cannabis company. Aphria's financials continue to be promising and Tilray's are not as solid but still decent. Aphria also acquired SweatWater giving them a solid start on cannabis related beverages. Aphria is the largest cannabis producer in Canada at 12.2% ([source](https://twitter.com/itsdgc/status/1356604397267124235)).  
So why APHA and not TLRY? When APHA and TLRY merge APHA shares will be .83 of a TLRY share. Because of this it is safe to assume APHA share price should = 0.83 x TLRY share price. TLRY share price is currently $25 which would mean that APHA share price should be around $20. For this reason APHA price being $15 right now is a steal assuming the merger goes through (looking promising for the merger to happen in Q2 this year).  

* **FIRE.TO/SPRWF:** I know what you are thinking.... "this gay boomer bear smooth brain thinks a penny stock is a good idea!?!".... hear me out. Supreme cannabis is one of those companies that never quite reached potential in the initial Canadian cannabis boom. Never had a real profitable quarter and has since been crushed to the ground by shorts ([source](https://shortdata.ca/stock/FIRE.TO/)). It has mostly been treated as just a dead stock and over the last few months people have dumbed on me for even mentioning this stock.  
I believe this is all about to turn around though. Supreme is having an earnings call on February 11th where I expect an extremely promising financial report and exciting upcoming news. Considering how undervalued this stock is (97 million market cap) it isn't going to take much to get this stock exploding. Volume and shorts have been exploding in this stock which shows huge promise. Supreme also makes up 3% of cannabis retail market in Canada ([source](https://twitter.com/itsdgc/status/1356604397267124235)). They also have connections in Australia and Israel markets.  


There are many more promising cannabis stonks out there and I encourage my fellow smooth brains to do their DD. Companies operating in multiple states are a safe bet ([check out this](https://www.greenmarketreport.com/the-cannabis-industrys-top-12-u-s-multi-state-operators/)). Also large companies like Canopy Growth, Curaleaf, etc. should all be decent stocks. If you are a retard interested in penny stocks check out FAF.TO and HITIF (along with SPRWF of course). 

Lots are coming out with earnings in the next few weeks, so keep your eyes out and remember to exercise those  

My positions: APHA 20@$7, SPRWF 4480@$0.13, (I know... r/babystreetbets)..... I plan on dumping more into APHA and doubling down on SPRWF after earnings come out.

**TLDR**: Cannabis STONKS  . Exercise your  and HOLD. IMO buy APHA and risk it on SPRWF, but do your own DD on cannabis stonks.

Title: DD on APHA
I think it is time I make a DD post that has nothing to do with a meme stonk. I am unable to use emojis off my laptop so please excuse me for not having enough rocket ships but I promise you this rocket ship is fueling up and we are a couple months away from blast off if not sooner.

Why should you trust me?

I am an economics major with a concentration in entrepreneurship and a minor in sales. I love money more than hookers love blow and I intend on making a lot of money so I can afford the hookers that like blow. I go to a pretty prestigious university and I love how WallStreetBets can connect "smart" money with "autist" money. I am 100% all in on APHA with my entire life savings because as Warren Buffett would say, " "**Diversification** is a protection against ignorance," "\[It\] makes very little sense for those who know what they're doing."  and I know what I am doing so I full sent it.

&amp;#x200B;

Why APHA?

They are conservative with their spending is what got me hooked first. Compared to other marijuana companies like ACB or Tilray, they aren't riddled with debt right off the back. (i'll get to the Tilray merger in a bit). This company has the cash on hand to purchase a MSO (multi-state operator) as soon as the US legalizes and my bet is that they are going to go for a MSO that has a heavy presence in Florida as the CFO stated in an AMA on reddit that Florida is where the market is, not California. The difference between APHA and any MSO or other LP is the fact that APHA merging with Tilray creates the first MCO or Multi-country operator. This means the company will be taking a piece of the cake from multiple cakes. You don't need to be #1 in America or Canada whenever you are directly engaged in multiple operations all over the world that increase your market share to be #1 worldwide.

&amp;#x200B;

With APHA and Tilray merging... which stonk do you buy? Easy, APHA.

The arbitrage play has APHA being changed to .83 of 1 Tilray share.

Currently tilray trades at 24.95 x 0.83 = 20.708

The current APHA price? 15.25.

This means that the gap has to close before the merger but is Tilray going to go down with all the pro marijuana news coming out? No, APHA has to go up to close the gap and today alone APHA is up 17.92% based on pro marijuana legalization news. BUT WAIT! Tilray is up 22.98% which means the GAP IS ONLY GETTING WIDER just like your wife's pussy after letting her 5 boyfriends have a turn since you've been so busy focusing on your GME stonk going down due to market manipulation.

&amp;#x200B;

The financials of APHA are strong, they FINALLY posted a profit of 0.01 EPS which may seem like little bitch shit but in reality most cannabis companies haven't hit profitability yet so they are ahead of the game. The one great thing about their financials is that Sweetwater Brewing wasn't factored into the earnings report which is AWESOME (Insert hellllaaa rocket emojis here). They are already turning a profit and THEN they are going to be adding more profits from a brewery that has strong revenue growth and turns a profit onto their balance sheet. While other companies have to figure out how to keep demand up after the holiday season, APHA has a raft to float on since Sweetwater provides a great level of float to the company. (I will post all relevant news articles at the end). The merge with Tilray makes this combined company a player in, Canada, Portugal, France, and then Sweetwater gives them US brand recognition. How does a beer company give US brand recognition? Look up the Sweetwater brand and you will see that this is a beer company for stoners and that is exactly what APHA needed. Right now the stock is stilling at $15 which is still relatively low, I can see this hitting anywhere from $50-75 EOY and like I said, I have my entire life savings in this stonk because I know the end of prohibition means the chance for the next Anheuser Busch which APHA is best positioned to become.

There's even more reasons to invest but I'm sure you get the point. This is going to be huge and if you're looking for a play in the marijuana sector this is your best option. Go on the weedstocks subreddit if you want even more verification or to see some alternative opinions. I made this post as a throwback to the good ole days to when WSB wasn't only about GME and AMC but also new emerging sectors. This is a great stock and I wouldn't have taken the time out of my busy schedule unless the time to blast off was fast approaching. Listen or don't I am gonna make tendies, I just want to share the wealth.

Sweetwater is actually a very big deal that is overlooked. They are expanding into more states which is simply creating a distribution chain for APHA/Tilray to distribute their product through. Imagine already having warehouses, sales reps, and shipping routes established before the US legalizes. APHA is going to be an MSO and MCO. The only thing that scares me is that democrats have said they don't want big companies coming in to sweep up market share whenever minorities have been directly impacted by the war on drugs. Could go both ways but Sweetwater provides somewhat of a foundation for the balance sheet and then the intrinsic value of the relationships/brand recognition that will already be established before any other LPs can get into the market will have APHA/Tilray the clear cut winner of the LPs. I strongly urge anyone that wants to get further into the marijuana investing space to visit the sub reddit Weedstocks rather than spamming WSB with these types of posts whenever their is a different sub dedicated to it. I have been a member of WSB and Weedstocks for over a year and both subs have their pros and cons.

READ THIS FOR INFO ON ARBITRAGE PLAY

Title: ThE VoLuMe WaS hiGheR ToDay WhY Was THe PrICe StiLl dOwN?
I didnt think I need to explain this. This is for new people getting intimated by the volume today and seeing it was higher compared to yesterday and are wondering why the price is still down. What happened on open was a decline downwards all the way down to $70-80 running on LITERALLY the same amount of volume yesterday at around 20-30 million, but as it hit $70-$80 you beautiful fuckers  didnt sell but instead gobbled that shit up all the way to $140 hence the spike in volume. When it went down again to $90 at closing you can see that the volume is also low similar to the decline at open. *Theoretically if they just kept reducing the price and no one bought but held we would have closed lower than $90 and would have definitely closed with close to the same amount of volume as yesterday*. I feel like people are missing the fact that it didnt just go down in price it also went up.

TL:DR YOU MAGNIFICENT BASTARDS ARE HOLDING WITH 69 KARAT DIAMOND HANDS.  VOLUME INCREASE WAS DUE TO THE RUN UP FROM $70-$80 @OPEN TO $140.  THE DECLINE DOWNWARDS AND THE DECLINE AFTER THE RUN UP WAS TRADING WITH SIMILAR VOLUME AS YESTERDAY! THEORETICALLY IF NO ONE BOUGHT THOSE DISCOUNTED PRICES AND RAN IT UP WE WOULD BE CLOSING AT AN EVEN LOWER PRICE FROM $90 AND SIMILAR LOW VOLUMES AS YESTERDAY!  (Not a financial advisor I just like the stock)

Title: The ratio of short volume to total volume confirms the GME sell-off over the last few days is shorting, not real selling. GME 
Many people here have pointed out that this selling seems artificial, multiple brokers report overwhelming buy orders, etc. The official data are in complete agreement with that. S3 and Ortex data are estimates, but FINRA data (from which the bimonthly official short interest reports are generated; this is the best there is) have shown that for the last five days, more than 50% of shares sold have been sold short:

[http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210202.txt](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210202.txt) (search GME; see also [2/1](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210201.txt), [1/29](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210129.txt), [1/28](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210128.txt), [1/27](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210127.txt))

[https://nakedshortreport.com/company/GME](https://nakedshortreport.com/company/GME) (pretty plot, though the data are slightly different from the official data given in the links above; both sources confirm that short volume has been &gt; 50% total volume over the last five days, including today)

As an aside, according to that second website, ["if you see  more than 20% of your overall volume initiated short on a daily basis... you may be under \[a naked short\] attack."](https://nakedshortreport.com/how-to-detect-short-trades) SEC, a little help, please?

In any case, the day before Robinhood and other brokers instituted the restriction on GME share and option buying was the last day that more than ***50%*** of *all GME shares sold* were not sold short. Shorts have been going in even harder on their shorting while they know buying is difficult for us. We win if we hold.

This is pretty definitive that shorts are causing the current crash, and they definitely haven't covered when doing so. It's mathematically impossible for shorts to cover if more than 50% of all shares sold in a day were sold short. Shorts are instead continuing to double down. GME will eventually rise, especially if Cohen and friends give some good news anytime soon (e.g., official company roadmap released, Cohen and friends buying the remaining shares they can, etc.). It will rise regardless of good news because shorts don't want to pay interest forever if a stock trades sideways. And as soon as all of us can buy an unlimited amount again, we can squeeze them once again.

I've shared FINRA data on here before and gotten some questions which have at this point become predictable, so I'm going to answer them below.

# Couldn't shorts open their position and cover by the end of the day?

No, because more than 50% of all shares were sold short, there were not enough shares for them to cover the shares they sold short even if every single share purchased other than a short share today was sold from a long to a short. It's mathematically impossible. They had to add at least around 10% of the total volume each of the last five days to their short position (most days had about 55% of shares sold short (some even more), and 100 - 55 = 45% not sold short; 55 - 45 = 10% more shares sold short than shares sold long). And I know that I bought more over each of the last few days, as did you glorious autists, so it was probably more than 10% of the total volume they were adding per day for each of the last five days.

# The total volume from those websites is less than the day's volume that my broker or another site tells me was traded

Yes, that's because FINRA only records data from specific markets/exchanges, not all of them. Although the total volume is less than what is sold over the entire market, the *ratio* of short sales to total shares sold is representative of the entire market, because they pull from the biggest exchanges. As mentioned above, FINRA is also the highest quality short data; the official bimonthly short data that is published is by FINRA pulling from these same data. These data are accurate.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit to add: I am not a financial analyst and this is not financial advice. Make up your own mind about everything. Also, I am long GME. 

**Edit 2/3/21**: Short volume was over 50% of total volume today too. Hold, beautiful retards, hold.   

**Edit 2/4/21**: Short volume was again over 50% of total volume today. Hold, beautiful retards, hold. 

**TLDR:** Shorts have added a retardedly large amount of new short positions over the last five days. Keep holding, don't sell, and when you can buy more buy more. **GME to fucking Orion's belt **

Title: Why AMC is Trash and why you should not hold
I was going to post a long drawn out message about why AMC has potential and why we should believe in them in the long run but all that got tossed out the window when I eventually came across their Movie Streaming service: [https://www.amctheatres.com/about/on-demand](https://www.amctheatres.com/about/on-demand) which I had to do WAY to much digging to find out it even exists (SMH).

I'll start by explaining the difference between Box Office sales vs Streaming.  Streaming is like DVD sales, where the production company must sign over rights to the movie to the service which eliminates any chance at residuals such as Box Office sales which is where a majority of their profit lies.  My theory is that this is why we've only very few "good" movies recently, most of the production companies are sitting on their canned file waiting for COVID to be over.

Why I think AMC dropped the ball...  AMC, like other movie theaters already have agreements in place to share "Box Office" proceeds with the production companies.  I'm not sure why they wouldn't get creative and offer this same model up during COVID and get a leg up on their competition (Amazon, Google, etc...).  My guess, the same reason that I had to spend an hour doing DD just to find out that the only reason I could see them being viable into the future, they ALREADY had a product for and just don't do anything with.  Their leadership is completely incompetent and the company was being shorted into bankruptcy for a reason.

AVOID AMC like the fucking plague stock that it is...

Title: Why the guy I saw on r/stocks is a smooth brained mouth breather, or why I still have diamond hands
I saw post over on r/stocks earlier today.  I'm ngl, it freaked me the fuck out like some sort of anti-moon tardo.  I totally fell for the FUD as my beloved rocket stonk continues to swan dive into my wife's boyfriends bunghole.

So onto why the pheasant's FUD ended up only causing an hours long instead of perma brain damage.  BECAUSE HE IS A SMOOTH MOUTH BREATHER:

1. Fact one: Buying has been greater than selling. Buying has been greater than selling. Everyone knows that if we buy and hold, a payday will come at some point thanks to the hedgies continuing to double down on GME shorts.
2. Fact two: multiple stonks have mirrored movement.  See AMC for an example.
3. Fact three: Volume is too fucking low.  Volume was only 77mil today looking at RH.
4. Fact four: the hedgies aren't closing their positions, see #3.  There are no more shares available to short.
5. Fact five: I haven't gone FULL retard.  Never go FULL retard.

&amp;#x200B;

My personal opinion is that we are never going to be able to build up enough momentum alone to turn this thing around.  But we don't have to.  We do not need momentum anymore, we just need to maintain scarcity of the shorted stocks.  Literally, just need to hold until the hedgies starts to close their positions, hold for as long as possible, then its all over.

This isn't a bubble, this isn't some overblown hype train, this is just the way of these meme stonks.  

This isn't a get rich quick scheme, this is buying tickets to the squeeze show.  Tickets just went on discount.  Anyone bailing is a smoothed brained pheasant.  Fuck you, fight me in the Wendy's. I am an alpha ape with a big pp. \*spams emojis\*

Title: Yall apes - check out $HIMS - its been sleeping behind the $GME scenes.
Do some research on $HIMS.  This seems primed to .  


ARK Invest bought nearly 500K shares of this small cap telahealth company on the 28th of Jan.

This is a high growth company - 128% revenue CAGR from 2018 to 2020.

They've consistently increased their gross margin - currently stands at 71%

They have accumulated over 2 million telahealth consultations in two years! It took Teladoc 13 years to get to 1 million telahealth consults.

Marketing spend and customer acquisition cost has consistently gone done every year.  Customer acquisition cost decreased from $160 to $110.  

Revenue per customer has increased every year and the duration it takes for a customer to spend $200 has decreased from 7 months to 4 months.  

They are expanding their total addressable market by offering new services this can potentially be in excess of a 100 Billion.

Title: Why GME is still in the game to trigger MOASS (MUST-READ BULLET POINTS)
Today was a crazy ride, and we've all been following the action the entire time. My opinion is that unless I can find compelling evidence that the squeeze is truly done for and off the table, my conviction has only grown stronger.

Most important things that stick out, all of which really build a case that must not be dismissed:

1) If shorts have covered, we should have noticed reasonable strong upwards momentum, as buying pressure consists of short covering along with retail buying, and a limited float.

2) Past few days we've seen trading volumes below average, likely suppressed demand caused by broker restrictions on buying. Lower volume can make any dump pull the price down easily. Especially when the demand side is getting locked out. Have to mention the timing of which Robinhood locked buying last week as well, coinciding with a massive dip.

3) Look at [this image](https://preview.redd.it/dralf2uks4f61.png?width=1900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52223e916aacb4f65681da1cfe4f5e1ade7cea30)

Notice how AMC &amp; GME have almost identical candlesticks, and the same is in the BB-NOK pair. It is undeniable that a lot of people are buying this stock and holding this stock. Not just in America but all across the world. We have global support.
You would think that with this many people in the trade (whether they are on the buying / selling side) we would see greater variance. This correlation to me looks like obvious manipulation by higher frequency and higher volume algorithmic trading.
It's hard to look at these charts and say that this is natural supply and demand. Seriously, same candlestick patterns on unrelated stocks. This price action is influenced by targeted manipulation to a high degree. Even if people were really selling off like crazy, wouldn't we see more natural candles?

4) We have mainstream media (MSM) covering the "reddit mania" extensively. MSM says reddit is trying to squeeze silver, which is false. You will not find anyone pushing to buy SLV on reddit. In fact, you will see a warning about silver and how many HFs have long positions in it.

5) We've seen an influx of bots on social media (reddit, FB, twitter) promoting silver, spamming that GME squeeze is finished, diverting attention away from the more uninformed audience. Why? If it's finished why the need for these?

6) MSM says the short squeeze mania is over and shorts have covered. If that is true, why are we seeing trade restrictions still on more and more brokers, and nonstop coverage all over TV and the internet. If it's over, why are there so many articles bashing retail to stay away?

7) GME is an outlier in the "failed-to-deliver" statistic, and has been put on NYSE short restriction (uptick rule). Something fishy is going on with the shares in the float.

8) SI% numbers are very conflicting. Especially the numbers that came around 30-50%. It was then later mentioned by someone in S3 that a different calculation was used. If you convert to the old calculation, you still get over 100% SI%. Why are they trying to change it all of a sudden?

To me, this is enough to say we're still in the game. If it's over, let them prove it by crushing GME to $20 and on February 9th we hear the official SI% being low. Then it's finished. Something tells me that it's not over, and this is all a ploy to mitigate the damage they are about to receive when GME eventually triggers the MOASS.

Can't say for sure it's a 100% trip to the moon and beyond, but what's really suggested otherwise? This whole misinformation campaign + price manipulation combo is too important to dismiss.

Remember I'm retard and please make your own financial decisions. This post is based on my observation and speculation.

Position 50 shares GME $210

 $GME to the moon 

**TL;DR** - *YES THERE IS LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN A SQUEEZE LAST WEEK, BUT WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEING LATELY SUGGESTS THIS IS NOT OVER! MOASS IS POSSIBLE UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE! WAIT FOR ACTUAL CONFIRMATION BEFORE THROWING IN THE TOWEL!*

**BULLISH SENTIMENT:**

Jochen Zeitz gives massive hope as a CEO and leader for HOG. The future is EV for the vehicle industry and motorcycles are no different. A niche market for powerful EV bikes has yet to be untapped and is what will push Harley Davidson into the future.

 he became CEO of Puma  making him the youngest ever CEO of a German company at the time  and turned the near-bankrupt business into one of the world's top three sports brands

 he now sits on the boards of Harley-Davidson, financial services company Cranemere, and the Kenya Wildlife Service, as well as running his own charitable foundation and co-chairing The B Team, a non-profit that he co-founded with Richard Branson in 2012 to promote sustainable business practices.

His previous ventures gave him a strong backing socially and experience with sustainable energy which is a must for Harley Davidson.

Touring and Large cruisers remain to be the biggest driver in profit and production for the company. Even through COVID-19 these remain steady. Introduction of their new bike, Pan-America Adventure Touring Motorcycle, is much more appealing to the younger crowd.

**ELECTRIC MOTORCYLES:**

Harley-Davidson is striving to be the leader in electric Motorcycles which will quickly set them apart from all other competitors and introduce a new segment of consumers for HOG. The executive staff is fully committed to a distinct product with go-to market strategies.

**BEARISH SENTIMENT:**

BOOMERS RIDE MOTORCYCLES XD

**TL;DR: BUY THE DIP :)**

The first year of losses is usually considered "tuition" to learn the market. But that doesn't mean you have to lose for a year, just means you should consider any losses a learning lesson. If you're down, either find your next move or diamond hand that shit out. 

If you're looking for a new move or additional position, my favorite right now is $ZIXI. There's a good article about it (it's #3 on that list) here:

**Summary**
TLDR version: Cloud/email/data security. Huge growth, recent acquisition, fair value estimate showing ~50% upside, earnings in 2 weeks at which point the fair value will likely increase even further as the recurring revenues from acquisitions and the continued growth push the data averages higher. 

**Positions**
Call volume for March-May expirys have been spiking, so that's where I'm at. Since the fair value is over $12, I'm buying $11 and $12 strikes.

Corsair IPO'ed in September at $17.00 and the stock went rocket rocket straight upto 30$+. The all time highs has been 50$ ish and is currently trading at 38$. They absolutely destroyed Q3 earnings and beat expectations in every department.   


**Here's some of the highlights of their Q3 earnings, Source :- globenewswire &amp; their Q3 report.**

Net revenue was $457.1 million, an increase of 60.7% year-over-year. Segment net revenue was $161.6 million, an increase of 128.8% year-over-year. Gaming components and systems segment net revenue was $295.5 million, an increase of 38.3% year-over-year.

Gross profit was $127.9 million, an increase of 112.4% year-over-year, with gross margin of 28.0%, an improvement of 680 basis points year-over-year.

Operating income was $49.7 million, an increase of 353.6% year-over-year.

Adjusted operating income was $61.4 million, an increase of 193.7% year-over-year.

Net income was $36.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.5 million in the same period a year ago, or $0.02 per diluted share.

Adjusted net income was $48.5 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, an increase of 384.0% year-over-year compared to adjusted net income of $10.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share.

The stock ran from 21$ to 40$ after their Q3 earnings report so there should be no brainer that stock won't do the same again. **Like I already mentioned, that anything discussed on this DD is not an advice and its a personal opinion.**

$CRSR had a non-dilutive offering last week at $35 per share. This didn't add shares, just gave their initial PE firm a chance to cash out. With 7M shares sold at $35, this built a solid new "floor" for the stock on high volume at $35. Corsair has 36% short interest (obviously lower than GME), but the main IPO lock up period doesn't expire til March. Corsair's current available float is only 20% of total shares outstanding while short interest is 36%. Not a lot of shares available for shorts to cover if the stock starts moving against them.

&amp;#x200B;

The Market Cap for this stock is \~3.31 B and their Revenue for Q4 is half of that? Insane. I'm likely expecting it to be way over the estimations above just like when they doubled expectations the quarter before. The floor for this is 35$ as shown by the past month and a half and It peaked at 51$.

Title: Data-Driven DD: I analyzed 265,000 rows of SEC Short Fails-to-Deliver data so you don't have to! (Extremely important data for Counterfeit Stock theories)
# The GME SEC Data and Hedge Fund Shitfuckery: A Deep Dive

As I'm sure many of you who have been following the "Counterfeit Shares" theory about the various short attacks on $GME have seen, the SEC publishes lagged data on the cumulative number of Fails to Deliver for every company. If you aren't caught up with the latest info on the counterfeit share theory, take a second and read [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/)'s \[post\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the\_real\_reason\_wall\_street\_is\_terrified\_of\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)) laying out the issue with hedge funds counterfeiting shares and how it relates to GME. Much of the analysis in Johnny's post comes from an article \["Counterfeiting Stock 2.0"\]([http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html)) which is definitely worth a read if you have the time and patience to do a deep dive into the evil shit carried out by hedge funds.

**TLDR of Johnny's post:** Hedge funds create a bunch of stock out of thin air and short it, selling the counterfeit shares on the open market and driving the price of a company down. They then fail to come up with the shares they sold in time, so the "counterfeit" shares are never backed up by real shares. This could be happening on a massive scale with GME, and Hedge Funds could have far greater exposure to GME than previously thought.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Data:**

I noticed that while [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/) and later [u/Peteskies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peteskies/) used data from the SEC releases in their posts, the data they actually showed was only a small piece, and lacked very important context. So, with that in mind, I took the SEC Fails-to-Deliver data \[releases\]([https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)) for both halves of November and December and the first half of January and took a look at what was going on using some pivot tables. I thought given the sheer amount of data (1.5 million cells) it would be tough to load in Excel but it actually ended up being pretty easy. (probably helped that my day job is just alternately making pivot tables and slamming my head into the wall, I've gotten pretty good at both)

IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS RELEASE EXTENDS TO JANUARY 14TH, 2021. THESE ARE NOT CURRENT CUMULATIVE OUTSTANDING FAIL-TO-DELIVER LEVELS

&amp;#x200B;

**Fails-to-Deliver Distributions:**

First, take a look at this handy histogram(ish) of companies with outstanding Fails-to-Deliver and their outstanding "counterfeit share" (cumulative Fails-to-Deliver) numbers:

https://preview.redd.it/6dmfpfql47f61.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf38fea8f5de2e45b36b48853f4d7afaca8f6c28

As you can see, GME is way outside of the pack when it comes to Fail to Delivers, and has significantly more "counterfeit shares" (FTDs) than almost any other company. The exact number comes in at a cool 621,483 shares. The x-axis scale isn't even linear, and you can see significant jumps in the last quarter.

&amp;#x200B;

If you think that's some crazy shit, wait until you see the distribution of Fail-to-Delivers per company by the dollar value of counterfeit shares ((Closing Price)\*(# of Outstanding Fails-to-Deliver)):

https://preview.redd.it/024mdiv147f61.png?width=1616&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=270fc53a5455994545a864e8b8e9c304b0e57b5c

GameStop has the SECOND HIGHEST Fails-to-Deliver net dollar value of all 5,147 stocks with current fail-to-delivers (as of 1/14/21). NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS of stock floating around that was simply created out of thin air. Here the x-axis isn't even linear either  if it were to scale, GME would be several meters to my right. Wild.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cumulative Fails-to-Deliver of GME over Time:**

Moving on to more interesting (and potentially more troubling) data, I took a look at the Fails-to-Deliver values over time for GME. I decided to go back to the beginning of November, then look at every number the SEC had released since on FTDs for GME. This is crucial context for the numbers that have been thrown around by [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/) and [u/Peteskies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peteskies/).

https://preview.redd.it/myt4zxy347f61.png?width=1328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=603b5d5f0a623dc0dc9ef0df1f3da05e7361340f

Now, this one is a lot less clear-cut than those histograms I just wrote about. As you can see, there have been huge fluctuations in the amount of "counterfeit stock" (Fails-to-Deliver) on the market. There is a definite pattern of Hedge Funds running up Fails-to-Deliver during GME surges and then covering once the price slumps a bit. I've talked with one of my sources involved with hedge fund operations, and he said this is pretty standard procedure  when you sell a naked short and the price spikes, you talk it out with your broker and get a few more days to cover. So really, this pattern is more or less normal. It's the stupidly large amounts Fails-to-Deliver that are getting churned that is the irregular part.

Here's a good spot to bring up my main concern with the kind of analyses that [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/) and [u/Peteskies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peteskies/) were putting out. You can see that there were 1.8 million Fails-to-Deliver on GME on December 2nd, but that number was basically completely covered by the 16th. Based on that data it seems at first glance that, for the most part, these reported Fails-to-Deliver are Hedge Funds/Brokers trying to avoid covering while high and simply waiting for the next dip. This data alone IS NOT SUFFICIENT to prove that there is an enormous, market-moving quantity of Fails-to-Deliver floating around the market. Of course, right after this data cuts out, GME shoots to the moon (300+), and I would expect a lot of naked short vendors were caught with their pants down. Maybe they all covered on the recent dips, maybe loads of Fails-to-Deliver are still out there.

A table with that GME info from the graph above for any lurking nerds:

https://preview.redd.it/0pj2hh0647f61.png?width=1090&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcf2d64f6777218dece7735075b779fb51e28cca

&amp;#x200B;

**Some Questionable Inferences and My Retarded Conclusions:**

So, what's the takeaway here, other than don't trust everything you read on WallStreetBets? I think there are a few lessons. First, even though Fails-to-Deliver numbers were bouncing all over the place, including being completely covered on 12/16, I think it's important to keep in mind that GME having this volume of Fails-to-Deliver, both in shares and in dollars, is extremely irregular compared to everything else. Could just be the fact that GME is an insane stock with insane volatility,\* or could be indicative of something more.

*\*Yet, this data is from back before GME became mainstream  GME in December was not an "unprecedented situation" like we have now. Thinking back to then, the high Fails-to-Deliver numbers are even more significant.*

**A Possibility of Hedge Fund Armageddon:**

I want to take a second to talk about one of the diagrams from the good folks who wrote \["Counterfeiting Stock 2.0"\]([http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html)), detailing both the "surface level" indicators of Disclosed Shorts and Fails-to-Deliver, and the below-the-surface hidden pathways that they believed pumped counterfeit shares into our financial system. Here it is:

https://preview.redd.it/v3io9bj847f61.jpg?width=1086&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21d67bbec3d7d4e3b2012b3d51cdaf462ae3318d

As you can see, the Counterfeiting 2.0 authors believed that Fails-to-Deliver were just the tip of the iceberg. Below the surface (and out of the sight of the SEC), they believed there was a massive volume of shares that had been "laundered," through foreign exchanged, offshore funds, or even gaps in the Continuous Net Clearing system at the DTCC. These stocks, theoretically, go from Fails-to-Deliver to simple counterfeit shares, or even straight to counterfeits. The arguments in the Counterfeiting 2.0 paper go way over my head as a simple retard, but I get the gut feeling at least some of them are accurate.

If, hypothetically, (please read this part in your best Ben Shapiro voice), the arguments in Counterfeiting 2.0 are true, then it is highly likely that the huge Fails-to-Deliver churn on the surface is just the tip of a massive illegal counterfeit short position. GME BULLS, listen up. If this counterfeit short position does exist, then it was probably entered back when GME was being driven towards bankruptcy, at a share price somewhere in the $15/20 range, and possibly expanded when GME was being driven down below $5. There are actually interesting data to suggest that this is a plausible scenario. First, the fact that, as [/u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) noted a year ago, the market cap of GME was driven below the net value of its assets. Obviously, this happens from time to time, but it's indicative of an extremely artificially depressed valuation. Secondly, the central use of illegal naked shorting is in driving companies to bankruptcy, and it did seem like GME was on its way out. Looking at GME as a scummy hedge fund manager, it would have made a very attractive target for a naked-short dilution attack.

These illegal short positions, if they were not covered by cautious (lol) Hedgies at the beginning of the GME runup, would have increased 50-100x in dollar value as the share price of GME rose. That's 5,000-10,000% for those who can't do basic math. Now I don't know if this scenario would be enough to crash the market, but it would certainly be enough to make a lot of extremely powerful people (currently engaged in a criminal enterprise) desperate and very, very angry. This hardly needs saying, but rich bastards have killed for far less than a billion dollars. Here, there could be tens of billions on the line.

So, that's the mega-bull case. We, the tards of WSB, expose billions in financial crime. The SEC rappels into Citadel and arrests everyone, Robinhood goes bankrupt, and all our wives and their boyfriends get filthy rich. However, there is also a very significant BEAR case here. If the regular, everyday investors who wrote Counterfeiting 2.0 were in fact retards like us, then there's a significant chance that they simply got it wrong. Maybe there is no sea of hidden counterfeit short positions, and maybe this whole Fails-to-Deliver thing is just rich assholes using extra trading days to cheaply sell shorts. What then? In that case, I would bet my left nut that all of the outstanding Fails-to-Deliver have been covered in the recent slump, and this whole exciting report is largely irrelevant to the future performance of GME.

I'm not going to make the case that either the bulls or the bears are right (even though my gut is with the bulls) because I simply don't have the information or mental capacity to make that call. Look at the data yourself, and draw your own conclusions. Retail is facing an enemy with more capital, more information, more experience, and fewer morals. Whichever way it goes, it's going to be an ugly fight.

&amp;#x200B;

Positions: 12 shares (Bought 50 at $20, sold 50 at $250, bought back in 12 at $300). I plan to hold until either $4,000 a share or things go to shit.

I am not a financial advisor, and I do not advise any readers to make financial decisions based on my opinions or the information presented in this report.

# TLDR: the cumulative Fails-to-Deliver volume on GME is massive compared to the rest of the market. However, is also extremely volatile, and small compared to the float. It is possible that high Fails-to-Deliver volume is a result of massive illegal share counterfeiting by shorts.

Title: GME liquidy is drying up - causing the share to become more and more volatile
[https://i.imgur.com/DxM4SwP.png](https://i.imgur.com/DxM4SwP.png)

I've borrowed and dumbed down this chart from [this savant's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l97jbo/gamestop_big_picture_market_mechanics/).

As the free-flowing stock dries up (due to ppl buying and holding), the volatility increases. It becomes easier and easier to move the needle with less money. As long as you keep holding and buying, the volatility will only increase. **Expect huge swings in the next few days.**

Hedge funds know this. They tanked the stock this morning. Right now they intentionally leveling the demand to keep the stock price stable; to make it look like the ride is over.

HOWEVER

The short float is still high, and the [volume has been steadily decreasing](https://i.imgur.com/eRH3S2b.png).

Furthermore, [institutional ownership](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings) only picked up about 12m shares, and some of those went to institutions that were long not short. Now maybe I'm misreading this, or maybe they're fudging the data, but I just don't see how the shorts covered their position with this measly volume.

|ACTIVE POSITIONS|HOLDERS|SHARES|
|:-|:-|:-|
|New positions|46|12,880,726|
|Sold out positions|34|3,412,841|

\--

Keep in mind the VW squeeze happened with far less short-interest than is currently in GME. The main problem is that retail investors, unlike huge firms, can't vacuum up all the supply fast enough, which enables the hf to slowly wiggle their way out buying up paper hands. They've likely exited their worst short positions and reshorted at a better price.

Some people are saying the squeeze might be more of a slow gradual upward pressure, rather than a sudden event. The truth is that the hedge funds are walking on a tightrope, and this stock is still extremely volatile. Any big movements in demand can drastically impact the price.

\------

Disclaimer: I am a poker player, not a day trader.  In poker, this is what we call an "implied odds play". The risk is relatively small for us bulls (relative to the short position), but the expected value is potentially huge if it works.  But these plays are still risky despite being +EV. **You have to be prepared to ride the swings and embrace the variance.**

*This is pure, uneducated speculation, not financial advice.*

**TL/DR: Grit your teeth and brace for swings. Shit's about to get nuts.**

Title: I know today was rough. But Ive been doing some serious research you guys need to read NOW!
I know two straight days of red is rough. But we cant let those HFS win. 

Yeah the stocks dropped because of their triangular short ladder attacks BUT were e not out of the fight yet. 

When the stock dropped below $100 its because the gamma squoze started. But because the volume was so low AH the Sigma slide started trending up. Which means that if it gets to $122.5 by tomorrow noon the HFS are fuk . So Im not selling.   4 life!!!!

Check out [this chart](https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4391447-gamestop-short-squeeze-is-over-for-now) and just do the math.

Title: All the shares in your brokerage accounts are the ones being lended out.
I know this seems obvious, but I thought it would be a good idea to take a look at exactly how short selling works from a brokers perspective. Maybe it will be enlightening. 

Brokers barrow the stock from your account, and turn around and lend it out to short sellers, who in turn, sells the shares and pray for the stock to go down. If the stock goes down, the short sellers can rebuy it and return it to the broker who returns it to you. That sound reasonable, right? But then whats all this about naked shorts? Well, a naked short, is stock that is sold short, but has no real counterpart -- its 'counterfeit' -- because at some point the broker either lent out too many shares, or, because the shares are no longer available to the broker.

"available to the broker?" you ask? why yes. Its illegal for the broker to lend shares it doesn't have access to, or shares that could not be sold. This is usually either, shares that are set on consignment, say for a CEO who would have inside knowledge, or for your sweet old granny who keeps her CVS stock in the closet. But there is one other way which stocks become unavailable, by being listed for trade. A stock can't be sold twice, so if a stock is listed for trade under any sell order, it cannot legally be loaned to a short seller.  

"But what if the stock is already heavily shorted?" you ask? Well, the broker can't just let the stocks be sold twice, and you have an absolute right to sell the shares you own whenever you want. So the broker needs to recall them to balance their books, prevent the sale of any 'counterfeit stocks,' and to reduce the broker's risk, because after all, they owe you the shares and wouldn't want to be stuck holding that bag.. 

"What happens when a broker recalls a shorted stock?" Well, the short has the obligation to return it. Quickly. So if for some reason you wanted to be sure that your shares were not being lent out, maybe you're afraid of market volatility right now, you could set high limit orders, even calling your broker to do so if they required it. With a high limit order set, any shares that the broker is lending out of yours would need to be immediately returned to you to avoid having a Failure To Deliver (FTD).

I thought you guys might like learning more about this process. i know I certainly did. [Here's another source.](https://www.contracts-for-difference.com/borrowing-lending-shares.html)

Now, I can't offer you any investing advice, because I'm not a broker, or financial planner.

I do really like my stonks though. I think my favorite stonks are worth much much more than the market says they're worth right now, so I called my broker Fidelity to set a limit order really high.

Title: Apes Let's start the real Revolution
I have a little Story for u all. About the past and the present. First of all I'm a young little German Ape, who created a German Facebook Group about ure fcking Diamond Hands so sorry for my bad English knowledge. 

In the past there was a time where nobody could fck the Roman Ape Empire (the Hedges today) on 1vs1, but there were a group of  smart autist  Vikingapes (the WSB Community Apes) . And they had a brilliant strategy to robb the Roman Apes. They had the sea on their side and the knowledge about shipping and war and at least their balls where pretty big. So they started to Robb (squeezes)some Bannanas of the Roman Apes, not all on in once but year for year everytime a bit. This strategy wents pretty well over hundreds of years.  

The thing in the present is this, where better connected and we don't need years to robb a fcking insane amount of Bannanas from the fcking Hedges. 
So let's do this I have a simple but a pretty nice idea I think. We just need to let the Hedges don't know about this plan and what Hedge we want to take the bananas from.  I would say, i know how we could do this. 

 Maybe the Alpha Apes of this brilliant Autist Community could send me a personal message if u agree with me , so we can put this into a brilliant revolution and if not, no problem I'm just a small Ape who wants to Robb some bananas and give it to them who where fcked by the hedges. So it will be anyone. 

If u agree this vote it up
Or comment if I'm wrong 
Fck this hedges in the spots where it normally hurts without butter

Title: Options Volume from today, Feb 2.
Wrote some code to list the top 30 options calls and puts. Data is from thinkorswim (i.e. TD ameritrade). First post was deleted by moderators this AM, hope this one holds.

A TON of action in options expiring on Friday. I suspect short-sellers are writing these PUTs and selling them to retail investors trying to cash in on the tank from their short-ladder attacks. At the same time, people (most likely hedge funds) are buying a large amount of calls also expiring on Friday. They will stand to benefit from both their short ladder attack and the inevitable rebound because **WE ARENT  SELLING BABY.**

Highest volume options plays:

|Exp.|Strike|Type|Vol|

Title: BlackRock increased their position in $AMC by 59% today!! They know something we dont
Here is the filing: https://t.co/Hrd6BE8ail?amp=1

Along with this there is also the rumor about an AMC and Amazon merge. Guess what just happened today? Jeff Bezos stepped down as CEO. What if the first move by the new CEO is to save movie theatres by merging with AMC. 

This tweet sums it up: https://twitter.com/trainstocks/status/1356713354631409665?s=21

BUY AND HOLD AMC!!! Why would BlackRock increase their position by that much unless they knew something?

Title: The State of Our Tendies
Today we saw our precious $GME fall to a level we have not seen since last Thursday - and then ever further beyond that point. We entered AH today at a lowly $90 per share. We may be entering our darkest hour yet.

Today we also got some good news too - the Mark Cuban AMA went well, and AMC theaters are reopening soon! Some executives are sharing that we may get $GME to over $1,000 soon, and if you compare our graphs with the Volkswagen graph from 2008, we have the M shape, we have the dip, and now we await the spike.

Let's get into what today meant for us. This has been a second hard day this week. Many are seeing either massive losses or unrealized gains evaporating. The media is delivering article after article on GameStop, literally every time the price falls a single dollar it seems. Today we have learned some new things - some of you may have read this, some of you may have learned this the hard way, and some of you might not accept this: if YOU personally can afford to hold this stock, you hold. Why would you sell? We have seen where this can go, we have seen how badly these guys are bleeding, we have seen the stock bounce from 450 to 124 to 300 in a span of 24 hours.

As of today, there are only 2.5 days for Wall Street to cover their shorts. This is a wave that is building up slowly and we are not going to let it go. We could potentially fuck Melvin and the gang THIS WEEK. In another post I made earlier today I had mentioned Thursday as my estimation of t-day (tendies day) - I still stand by that: Thursday will be the beginning, but Thursday will not be the end of anything. Posts today have mentioned that Melvin may be committing massive fraud by illegally covering their shorts - and I believe them.

As investors, we control the market by holding. The people we are fighting against, Melvin and Gang, they can't do this forever. Hell, they probably can't do this for another week. They have spent the last few days sowing dissent in our community, monitoring everything we do, and trying to get the upper hand yet again. The only problem for them - they can't. As long as WE hold our shares, they have already lost. They would need to get people like DFV to sell in order to make a dent in our morale.

**So what does any of what I just said mean?** 

We are gonna see status quo tomorrow. Buy the fire sale if you like the stock, if you don't, don't. Thursday or Friday, we start seeing a fire get lit underneath Melvin's hairy nuts and we will watch it spread viciously, all while making ourselves a quick buck. 

**Will there be a lot of time for us all to get out?**

Like anything like this, some will make more than others. Selling lowers the price of a stock. If you need $10,000 for a life saving surgery, pull out at $10,000. We joke a lot about how everyone needs to hold, but most people will not hold it against you. We get that sometimes the money IS more important than the cause.

**What if it doesn't happen this Thursday/Friday?**

Then we wait. This is a game of patience. To the patient go the tendies! 

**What is a short ladder attack?**

Hedgefunds bid on each other's stock, lowering the price artificially. There is little volume on these trades - since nobody can buy, it plummets the price. The only effect it has is if we sell, which not many people are doing.

**Why are so many people still holding? Why didn't we cash out earlier?**

This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. This event has the potential to change lives and change rules. Personally, as long as I sell over 80$, I won't be sad. 

&amp;#x200B;

Position: 25 shares @ 80$

Note: this is not financial advice in any way, I have a PhD in Apenomics, but I sadly am illiterate and have no thumbs. Thank you u/SEC.

Title: The State of Our Tendies
**TLDR**: hold and wait for Thursday/Friday - buy if you like the stock, otherwise go jack off for a couple days and come back to lots of tendies 

Today we saw our precious $GME fall to a level we have not seen since last Thursday - and then ever further beyond that point. We entered AH today at a lowly $90 per share. We may be entering our darkest hour yet.

Title: From Tellurian sub ... Im long this non-stonk. Lots for DD, CEO is an OG and posts on YouTube once a week company update. $TELL from r/TellurianLNG
Tellurian $Tell Long Term Investment Outlook and Value Proposition

Update 1/29/2021 - Mods removed this post from Reddit WSB and stocks. I figure it was time to launch a subreddit for this great company that we're invested in. Thank you for visiting, please Join our sub-reddit. We're going to have FUN this year!!

Update 1/28/2021 - Thank you for the comments and discussion. I've updated the post to include the feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

**Who is Tellurian Inc?**

"Tellurian Inc (TELL) is a liquefied natural gas (LNG) development company headquartered in Houston, TX. TELL plans to develop a 27.6 mtpa LNG terminal with five plants near Lake Charles, LA, as well as upstream assets and pipeline infrastructure. The initial phase will likely include 3 plants (16.6 mtpa capacity). The Driftwood project will be financed by equity customers/partners as well as project debt financing. Tellurian will own 28%-42% of Driftwood Holdings and 100% of Tellurian Marketing."

**Why Tellurian?**

Tellurian is a market disruptor with their proposed Driftwood Project, which will make them the first end-to-end (well for the production company, pipeline network for transportation, terminal LNG for exporting) exporter with an at-cost LNG acquisition independent of domestic Henry Hub (HH) as they'll be selling primarily on Japanese Korean Marker (JKM) at this time.

HH - [https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/natural-gas/natural-gas.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/natural-gas/natural-gas.html)

JKM - [https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/natural-gas/lng-japan-korea-marker-platts-swap.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/natural-gas/lng-japan-korea-marker-platts-swap.html)

Driftwood Project has received federal permits and is 30% engineered. Capital will be funded by equity partners, most likely long-term buyers of future LNG. The equity partner will receive future contracts for at-cost LNG in exchange for the front load of capital. Current partners already include Total and GE. $5B capital is needed for the Final Investment Decision (FID).

Current assets include:

Haynesville Gas Production Well to supply gas. 10,067 net acres and 71 producing wells.

Driftwood LNG LLC, owned by Tellurian Inc., is developing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) production and export terminal on the west bank of the Calcasieu River, south of Lake Charles, Louisiana.

Driftwood plans to deliver LNG &lt; $3.50/mmBtu. ($3.50/mmBtu FOB LNG price &lt; $2.00 gas delivery + &lt; $0.75 opex + &lt; $0.75 debt service)

*The value proposition to equity partners is $5 JKM to realize ROI.*

**All-Star Management**

Tellurian has 2 of 3  pioneer LNG founders that developed the largest Natural Gas companies.

Charif Souki - Chairman - LNG Godfather and Legend, who was the founder of Cheniere Energy in 1996. If they can do it once, they can do it again.

Octvio M.C Simoes - CEO - "Previously, he was President and CEO of Sempra LNG &amp; Midstream where he was responsible for all LNG and natural gas midstream activities in Sempras efforts to develop, build and operate liquefied natural gas (LNG) receipt terminals, liquefaction facilities, natural gas pipelines and storage facilities."

Cheniere Energy (LNG) - [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LNG/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LNG/)

**LNG**

Over the next decade, there will be a large difference in demand to supply for LNG as countries transition from Coal/Nuclear to "cleaner renewable" sources from a combination of both natural gas and renewables will make up 74% of the energy landscape. In addition to the domestic shortage of natural gas with the number of offshore rigs shut down during COVID. Even if they turned them on, it would be 1-2 years before production would be online again. Tell will be exporting to Asian LNG market (JKM) and European LNG market (TTF) where local markets for natural gas extraction are limited and will rely on imports from providers such as Tell.

[https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/AEO2020%20Natural%20Gas.pdf](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/AEO2020%20Natural%20Gas.pdf)

[https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/AEO2020%20Electricity.pdf](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/AEO2020%20Electricity.pdf)

Liquefied natural gas exporters

Given the unprecedented wave of LNG projects taking final investment decisions (FIDs) in 2018 and 2019, the global LNG market is expected to have surplus capacity for the next four to five years. In the second wave of LNG exports, more than 20 North American projects are competing to take FIDs, but only a few are likely to succeed. Those that can deliver LNG to Asia for no more than $7 per MMBTU have the best prospects, and those that secure privileged access to upstream gas resources can increase their projects cost competitiveness.

This is the perfect example of the value in Telluriam and Driftwood Pipeline. Capitalize on being the only end-to-end exporter and ROI at $5 per MMBTU.

Give Planet of the Humans documentary a watch. It's on Youtube or Prime. Good explanation of LNG's role over the next 25 years. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet\_of\_the\_Humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_of_the_Humans)

**Price Targets**

1/21/2021 - Wolfe Research - PT $5.00

At max capacity, Tell valuation would be 100B made by Souki the chairman. Break down the math from there. Tell will retain 40% of capacity for themselves.

2021 - February = $4-$6 (1B valuation / 329M shares)

2021 - March/April = $8-$12 - Deals announced gap up (3B valuation / 329M shares)

2021 - May/June or FID announced = $15-$20 - 5B in capital in (5B valuation / 329M shares)

2023 = $45 at Phase 1 Project completion (15B in valuation / 329M shares). Note: I would expect 1 year delay to 2024 due to hurricanes or natural events.

Mid-decade will see a peak in Demand/Supply pricing where LNG company's valuations could get frothy, much like early to mid-2000s with oil peaks.

Future: 40% capacity equals $80 a share

Future: 100% capacity equals $130 a share

Max would be 100B valuation / 329M shares at $300. Equity partners could comprise 40%-60% of equity that would eat into total available shares.

Current assets include:

Haynesville Gas Production Well to supply gas. 10,067 net acres and 71 producing wells.

Driftwood LNG LLC, owned by Tellurian Inc., is developing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) production and export terminal on the west bank of the Calcasieu River, south of Lake Charles, Louisiana.

Driftwood plans to deliver LNG &lt; $3.50/mmBtu. ($3.50/mmBtu FOB LNG price &lt; $2.00 gas delivery + &lt; $0.75 opex + &lt; $0.75 debt service)

*The value proposition to equity partners is $5 JKM to realize ROI.*

**All-Star Management**

Tellurian has 2 of 3  pioneer LNG founders that developed the largest Natural Gas companies.

Charif Souki - Chairman - LNG Godfather and Legend, who was the founder of Cheniere Energy in 1996. If they can do it once, they can do it again.

Octvio M.C Simoes - CEO - "Previously, he was President and CEO of Sempra LNG &amp; Midstream where he was responsible for all LNG and natural gas midstream activities in Sempras efforts to develop, build and operate liquefied natural gas (LNG) receipt terminals, liquefaction facilities, natural gas pipelines and storage facilities."

**LNG**

Over the next decade, there will be a large difference in demand to supply for LNG as countries transition from Coal/Nuclear to "cleaner renewable" sources from a combination of both natural gas and renewables will make up 74% of the energy landscape. In addition to the domestic shortage of natural gas with the number of offshore rigs shut down during COVID. Even if they turned them on, it would be 1-2 years before production would be online again. Tell will be exporting to Asian LNG market (JKM) and European LNG market (TTF) where local markets for natural gas extraction are limited and will rely on imports from providers such as Tell.

Liquefied natural gas exporters

Given the unprecedented wave of LNG projects taking final investment decisions (FIDs) in 2018 and 2019, the global LNG market is expected to have surplus capacity for the next four to five years. In the second wave of LNG exports, more than 20 North American projects are competing to take FIDs, but only a few are likely to succeed. Those that can deliver LNG to Asia for no more than $7 per MMBTU have the best prospects, and those that secure privileged access to upstream gas resources can increase their projects cost competitiveness.

This is the perfect example of the value in Telluriam and Driftwood Pipeline. Capitalize on being the only end-to-end exporter and ROI at $5 per MMBTU.

Give Planet of the Humans documentary a watch. It's on Youtube or Prime. Good explanation of LNG's role over the next 25 years. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet\_of\_the\_Humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_of_the_Humans)

**Price Targets**

1/21/2021 - Wolfe Research - PT $5.00

At max capacity, Tell valuation would be 100B made by Souki the chairman. Break down the math from there. Tell will retain 40% of capacity for themselves.

2021 - February = $4-$6 (1B valuation / 329M shares)

2021 - March/April = $8-$12 - Deals announced gap up (3B valuation / 329M shares)

2021 - May/June or FID announced = $15-$20 - 5B in capital in (5B valuation / 329M shares)

2023 = $45 at Phase 1 Project completion (15B in valuation / 329M shares). Note: I would expect 1 year delay to 2024 due to hurricanes or natural events.

Mid-decade will see a peak in Demand/Supply pricing where LNG company's valuations could get frothy, much like early to mid-2000s with oil peaks.

Future: 40% capacity equals $80 a share

Future: 100% capacity equals $130 a share

Max would be 100B valuation / 329M shares at $300. Equity partners could comprise 40%-60% of equity that would eat into total available shares.

Title: Real GME talk () and why I believe
Disclaimer: Im new here and I am dumb so this is not financial advice but the opinion of an actual dumb person TLDR at bottom

So to start off I wanna disclose my GME position. I bought 1 share at $20 and  at $30. I then rebought in with .9 shares at a 152 avg and I am still holding them but we all know what happened Thursday and me literally living paycheck to paycheck I couldnt invest more on fidelity or Webull without selling my 122 shares of AMC at 5.69 (nice), and my 24 share of BB.

With that being said I am still HOLDING even at a loss and here is why:

So to start off I need to clear something up THE VW CHART IS OVER A YEAR AND GME IS OVER A MONTH. If you zoom out to 3 months or further you see how high GME jumped. So to be a  here Thursday might have been the short squeeze and due to RH and other companies cutting off trading stopped the squeeze. The problem here is that a lot of GME investors then became emotionally invested which lead to this sub being flooded with RH hate and post about the squeeze has not been squoze. Now this MAY be true still but I may also be wrong.

WHY I AM HOLDING

1.  what if the squeeze hasnt been squoze?

2. I only have $150 in which although is a good amount for me it is nothing compared to what I see some people have in it and if they can hold/ stick it to the HFs so can I.

3. I think GME has a future now. If Ryan Cohen can do what he did with Chewy then there is no reason GME wont have a solid low price stock that will slowly climb.

4. GME is now the brand of a movement. I see a lot of talk on here about going to GameStop now and in the future for anything video game related in order to ensure that they dont get bankrupted by HFs and if this continues that would be good for the company since there are 8+ mil of us on this sub. Combine that with the insane amount of free advertisement from media and billboards (I even bought one in New Orleans for a few days with $20 since RH wouldnt let me invest) and even people who arent on WSB now have GameStop in the back of their minds. This company now has a second chance to do it right.

5. This is more of a personal reason but lets say GME bottoms out and doesnt squeeze, Im just gonna BUY THE DIP and this will average down my cost of $152 per share and since I like this stock I can just hold long term and as the company grows so will my stock and profit. Now I understand this might not work if you have a ton of money in but for people in my situation who believe in Ryan Cohen and GameStop this is a viable strategy to  your way to a profit.

So I just wanna thank everybody on this sub for the week of memes, calling out of a corrupt system, donations to charity and hopefully the saving of GameStop Im glad I was and still am a part of this history.

TLDR; VW squeeze and GME squeeze are different dont compare but if you can afford to and truly like the stock  GME worst case scenario you save a company that has a new lease on life and best case  to the  while the HFs go down.

Edit 1: I also just realized they GME used to pay dividends. If they bring them back this could also help recoup any money lost if you try to average down.

Title: UPCOMING PENNY STOCKS
Sometimes emotions can get in the way I understand and we don't always make the moves that we wish we madebut it is very important to stay level-headed in this game if you're going to make a difference.. can't make a difference if you're broke...the world is changing in small ways as we look about us we just need to do our best also. There is nothing better than good due diligence and sound financial judgment to make trading decisions. With that in mind of course there are many opportunities where there is hype involved with newer companies and spacs that are led by very smart investors..with all that said I like to do my own diligence and that's how I come up with gems like AWSL. ACBCQ and CURLF.. every one of these is a company that I expect to make 100% to 5,000% on....

Title: Three SEC Violations Regarding GME Short Trades
Credit: u/President_Wolfe

***TLDR: I think I've found at least 3 violations of SEC regulations?***

Compiling some research, post not complete but being used for dumping SEC regulations that appear to have been violated based on last weeks GME shenanigans:

1) ***Rule 201  Short Sale Price Test Circuit Breaker.*** Rule 201 generally requires trading centers to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to prevent the execution or display of a short sale at an impermissible price when a stock has triggered a circuit breaker by experiencing ***a price decline of at least 10 percent in one day.*** *Once the circuit breaker in Rule 201 has been triggered, the price test restriction* ***will apply to short sale orders in that security for the remainder of the day and the following day,*** unless an exception applies.

2) ***Rule 203(b)(1) and (2)  Locate Requirement.*** Regulation SHO requires a broker-dealer to have ***reasonable grounds to believe that the security can be borrowed*** so that it can be delivered on the date delivery is due before effecting a short sale order in any equity security.[[7]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn7) ***This locate must be made and documented prior to effecting the short sale.***

3) ***Rule 204  Close-out Requirement.*** Rule 204 requires brokers and dealers that are participants of a registered clearing agency[[8]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn8) to take action to close out failure to deliver positions. Closing out requires the broker or dealer to purchase or borrow securities of like kind and quantity. 

The participant must close out a failure to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+4. If a participant has a failure to deliver that the participant can demonstrate on its books and records resulted from a long sale, or that is attributable to bona fide market making activities, the participant must close out the failure to deliver by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+6. 

If the position is not closed out, the broker or dealer and any broker or dealer for which it clears transactions (for example, an introducing broker)[[9]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn9) may not effect further short sales in that security without borrowing or entering into a bona fide agreement to borrow the security (known as the pre-borrowing requirement) until the broker or dealer purchases shares to close out the position and the purchase clears and settles. 

In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO ***requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out failures to deliver in securities with large and persistent failures to deliver,*** referred to as threshold securities, ***if the failures to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.***[[10]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn10) 

Threshold securities are equity securities[[11]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn11) that have an aggregate fail to deliver position for five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency (e.g., National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC)); ***totaling 10,000 shares or more; and equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer's total shares outstanding.*** 

As provided in Rule 203 of Regulation SHO, threshold securities are included on a list disseminated by a self-regulatory organization (SRO). Although as a result of compliance with Rule 204, generally a participants fail to deliver positions will not remain for 13 consecutive settlement days, ***if, for whatever reason, a participant of a registered clearing agency has a fail to deliver position at a registered clearing agency in a threshold security for 13 consecutive settlement days, the requirement to close-out such position under Rule 203(b)(3) remains in effect.***

Still reading through it myself but it seems that there have been violations of ***SHO Rules 201,203, and 204, any input would be greatly appreciated!***

***TLDR;***

***1) NO SHORTS should have been executed Thursday when GME dropped down to $132 because it fell more than 10%***

***2) No new shorts should have been issued because there's no reasonable belief that they could find actual stock to lend given 140% short float, and I doubt they secured it PRIOR to issuing new stock***

***3)They should have already executed the failed to delver shorts ASAP because of the high number of FTD's and the high number of shorted shares***

Title: How To Avoid A FOMO Buy In 10 Steps
This checklist might save your day or at least save you some dollars. 

You might think that you would never FOMO into a stock or you might be wondering if this applies to you. Ask yourself these questions to find out if you need the checklist. 

- Have you ever thought of buying some super hyped shares at ATH?

- Have you thought about joining the team in the squeeze on stockthatshallnotbenamed? (Ps. there are no teams in retail investing its every man for himself)

- Do you use WallStreetBets? 

If you answered yes to any of the precursor questions below then you are in danger of a FOMO trade and need this checklist. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HOW NOT TO FOMO CHECKLIST 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Ask yourself why you want to buy the stock. Are you jealous of others gains? Do you want to be part of that weeks big thing? If yes to either then do not buy. Jealous trading is bad trading. 

2. Warren Buffet said be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy. Ask yourself if people are being greedy with the stock you want to buy, do not buy if they are. 

3. Ask yourself am I being a sheep? Sheep do not make money on the stock market, they dont even understand the stock market, they are sheep. Dont be a sheep. 

4. Where did you see the stock? If it was on the news dont buy it. If its trending on one of the subreddits then its probably too late. 

5. Is it often appearing on the subreddit and being regularly pushed by the same small crowd? Watch out cause without proof they are probably bag holders hoping to pass the bag to you. 

6. Can you explain to somebody what the company does and why it is a good idea to buy it? If not then you shouldnt buy it yourself. 

7. Is the market mostly red or mostly green that week? Sell on green weeks and buy on red weeks. It might feel like the other way around at the time but thats emotional trading. 
8. Is it a meme stock? If yes then be an early adopter or dont adopt at all. 

9. Have you got spare capital? If money is no issue to you or if you are making a small punt that wont harm your finances then go ahead. If you are making a big, late move into a meme stock then youll be seeing red. 

10. Does it have emojis in the DDs? If yes then disregard all previous steps and bet your house on it.

Title: CBOE short sale data: how should I interpret?
Hi, I'm trying to add a few wrinkles to my brain.

Would someone be able to assist with how to interpret this data?

[CBOE short sale daily report](https://www.cboe.com/us/equities/market_statistics/short_sale/)

Another relevant link: [investor.gov short volume and transaction data](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/short-sale-volume-and-transaction-data)

There are 4 files:

* BZX Equities
* BZY Equities
* EDGA Equities
* EDGX Equities

What do short sale types "M" and "S" represent? I'm planning to do some data aggregation.

If I'm posting to wrong place, let me know.

edit: 6:54 PM EST. I contacted CBOE to get more clarification. If they respond, I'll update this post. For now, type=M shows $60.4m. Type=S shows $93.0m.

Title: (DG) Dollar General: The Golden Crackhead of WSB
Greetings Autists,

I know this isnt GME DD, (and you mother fuckers better not sell GME to buy into this) but this is too good to miss out on.

Chart Analysis:

https://preview.redd.it/w98cdycbn4f61.png?width=809&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4ec8a655145eb5b7cb7847e119112c25f1f6e6c

Dollar General is near its 6M low, incredibly oversold and anything near 190 is a fucking steal. Overall, the RSI is 41 on the yearly and trading well under the 50 and 200 SMA.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 0a4wq3jco4f61...*

I know the F word is shunned here and I don't use it very much, but the FUNDAMENTALS ARE FUCKING CRAZY. With these fundamentals the price it's trading at it is criminal. After consulting the Bloomberg terminal, the monkey analysts have a price target of $235 and the majority of them have buy ratings on the stock. In addition, Dollar General has an estimated revenue of +20%  YoY and a P/E ratio of 19. Overall the sentiment on DG is very bullish, and If you don't give a shit about what the analysts say the value of the stock is shown in the fundamentals, they are just confirmation bias.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Play/TL;DR:

Earnings is on March 11, I expect a good run up correction before then. The Fundamentals show that IT LITERALLY CANT GO TITS UP. 

Position: DG Feb/19 $210 Calls 

Good luck my friends, Diamond Hands forever

Title: (GME DD) Empire Strikes Back, or why you should still trust DFV.
## Market Close, and all the attacks so far.

This has been a rough week so far. GME is closing at around 90, and either you are seeing massive losses, or the unrealized gains you had evaporate right in front of your eyes. The media is spewing out 200 articles per day saying 'Gamestop is over', and that anyone who stays in the stock is retarded.

But it's simple. As Mark Cuban himself said,  

&gt;If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.  
&gt;  
&gt;Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of.

And ask yourself, **what WSB is really made of?** Is it just plain autistic and retarded traders? Yes, but we also have our Diamond community. People that are actively trying to beat the market, that do their due diligence, and that want to bathe in chicken tendies.

And we have seen post after post of their DD, reinforcing over and over what we were always here for.   
And let me tell you: **Nothing has changed.**

# The short term plan (SHORT SQUEEZE)

Alright, I'll bust out the numbers quick:   
[https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&amp;submit=Short+Quote](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&amp;submit=Short+Quote) says that the Short Interest is stil  61,780,000 shares, or 120%. The shorters have obviously refilled their shorts, knowing that their **market manipulation has driven the price down wonders.**

**Their greatest hope** to **avoid** the *Squozening* is to scare off everyone who is holding. They won't stop dumping the stock using everything they have to keep the price away from execution princes, and **avoid getting gamma squeezed again.**

**But,** this doesn't change that 120% of short interest is still insane. They have RELOADED their own failure, failing to acknowledge the power the retail trading community posseses. 

In fact, the stock has been put in the NYSE restricted list of Short selling. They quite literally can't short this stock anymore. So once this rises again, the MMs have NO REASON to start dropping the price again, as they can't benefit once more from shorting on the way down.

This week we are extremely weak as a community due to the immense number of traders having to transfer to Fidelity/Schwab/other brokers, and the MMs have clearly made great use of this. Hell, Drivewealth, one of the biggest clearing brokers for international traders (such as myself), restricted buying GME, and have said to be able to clear buying GME very soon

But as the fund transfers are complete, and Robinhood acquires more capital to realize their trades, and the other brokers lift restrictions, GME will MOST DEFINITIVELY skyrocket. Once the rocket starts going off again, ALL THE FOMO FROM PEOPLE WHO MISSED 300+ WILL SHOW!

**So the SHORT SQUEEZE STILL CAN HAPPEN.** 

# The long term plan (RYAN COHEN IS GOD, Q4 is still coming)

Don't forget that we still have Ryan Cohen on board, and with expected record sales from this console cycle, Gamestop is very far away from going bankrupt. 

Remember: The ideal situation for shorts is a bankruptcy/delisting.

Ryan Cohen is still in, the Quarterly report for GME is still coming, and the long term prospects of the company are still FUCKING BULLISH.  Even if we can't force a squeeze in february, long term changes done to the company can still trigger a short squeeze. In fact, most of the rise of GME so far has been done through investors buying in, not through short squeezes. 

Yes, it is fact that many shorts have covered (At BILLIONS of losses), but this doesn't change our fundamental thesis: *Gamestop + Ryan Cohen = Rokit mun*. The VW squeeze happened after DAYS of red, you better believe we can end up waiting for a month for the squoze.

# TLDR: HOLD OR BUY MORE, YOU FUCKING APES. IT'S NOT OVER. You know why? BECAUSE

# WE. LIKE. THE. STOCK.

Positions: 100 @ 15.8

Title: Stop buying AMD Calls
Hey guys,

A lot of you don't know me, as I don't usually post here. I'm usually over at /r/AMD_stock posting DD there. But I'm posting here because the recent activity in the stock led me to realize a huge, glaring problem with the stock's performance and it's latest earnings.

Let me step back a bit first.

Last Friday the stock plummeted 12% after posting the best earnings it possibly could have posted. At AMD_Stock, we usually brush off the post-earnings crush and continue our bull plays (or the smarter ones wait until after earnings to get back in). But this post-earnings crush was different. For this earnings, there was zero fundamental reason why the stock should go down. The earnings were excellent, the margins were excellent, the guidance for 1Q21 was incredible, and the guidance for FY21 was almost double what the street was expecting. Yet the stock still went down. It went down from $94 pre-earnings to almost $84....*on the best possible news*. 

What more could the street have wanted? Did shareholders want a +60% revenue increase YoY, instead of just +40%? Did they want 3x year-over-year revenue in 1Q20, instead of just 2x? Did the street expect us to beat our FY20 targets by more than they anticipated? Did investors want the fab capacity issues to be completely resolved earlier than 2Q21? Did they want Milan to be released earlier than March '21? Was there any reason to sell off after an earnings as incredible as that? You could even see the [bewilderment](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/27/full-interview-with-amd-ceo-lisa-su-on-q4-results-product-pipeline-demand-and-more.html) on Lisa Su's face as she started an interview with CNBC the morning after.

Why? [No financial news](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-q4-2020-advanced-micro-devices-earnings/), not even [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/26/amd-amd-earnings-q4-2020.html), could pin a 'reason' on the drop.

And then I realized the problem. It's you.

You buy the cheapest AMD weeklies you can and hold them through earnings like it can't go tits up. You hope that AMD beats all expectations, and that the stock price skyrockets on your tendie-train choo-choo-ing to the moon. Post-earnings you sell your OTM calls just as they go ITM to some suck-ass broker-dealer, and go do some hookers and blow and make a golden shrine to Mama Su and thank her for your amazing luck. Good thing those stupid broker-dealers were so desperate to buy your calls just before expiry.. you would have bankrupted them if you held on to them any longer!

The day after earnings comes and you wake up and the price is down 5% and dropping. You sell immediately, because you can't see it recovering by Friday, when your calls expire. This causes MMs to sell the shares they bought as a hedge against selling you your calls. Stock goes down further. Other people sell their calls, and MMs sell more shares to reduce the hedge even more, on and on until Friday expiration rolls around and bag-holders let their calls expire worthless, along with their hopes and dreams.

Stop losing at AMD! How? *INVEST PROPERLY*

How? Buy and hold shares or LEAPS. Stop chasing the mythical overnight gains. AMD is a *long-term success* and it has [room to double](https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/l6jijo/rosenblatt_securities_says_amd_could_double_in/). DO IT NOW - Price is recovering from the crush, but are still trading at a [20% discount to analyst consensus](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast), and at a 10% discount from it's recent highs.

Conclusion: This is a better buy-and-hold than GME, BB, or anything. AMD has grown continuously in the past 5 years and, if you read the DD on /r/AMD_stock, you'll discover that it also has an incredible growth roadmap the next 5 years.

Stop losing. Buy shares and double your money.

Positions: 4800 AMD shares @ $27.96

Title: GME: the Big Wave is building up, can you feel it? 
Diamond holders, tendie lovers, autists of all countries, GME gang. Listen to me when I speak these words (mods pls don't delete). Today is the worst it can get. We hit a floor at $80 due to profit taking and short repositioning over the last few days. $80 is the neutral price target that the guys over at [www.gmedd.com](https://www.gmedd.com) assigned, realistically it can't drop lower without it literally being an undervalued stock. No one of GME gang is selling, so stop pointing fingers at eachother. Only margin call marvins are forced to sell, may their hands rest in paper. Overall this is blatant artifical price lowering that will come back to bite the hedge funds in the ass eventually. Just wait and see.

Let's cut to the chase: everyone that saw their unrealised gains evaporate over the last couple of days and turn into losses needs to chill the fuck out. The best thing to compare this to in your mind is a tsunami. **At first, there is an earthquake**. This is our subreddit getting GME on our radars and massively buying in, this has become an international movement against corporate greed. The shock was felt throughout the entire financial ecosystem.**Then because of the earthquake, the ocean pulls back from the shores.** This is the hedge funds attacking us with all kinds of illegal manipulation right now to try and pull us apart, they try to make us sell our stock at prices that are below five digits (what are they thinking?). **But what the hedge funds forget is that when the ocean pulls back, a big wave is forming silently in the distance**. A wave (the MOASS) with such a colossal force that it will wipe out anything standing in its way. And when that wave hits, there will be hell to pay.

You guys only need to **diamond hold on for your dear lives** while the wave builds. I know things seem bleak right now, but there is no way the squeeze doesn't happen at this point. Remember, the hedge funds initially got in at a price of $20 and pushed it down to $4. The $80 floor is still 4 times their initial buy in price. Of course, over the times old shorters sold their positions to new shorters, but the positions remain the same. Those loons are still betting for a GameStop bankruptcy. Hedge funds have been bleeding ever since the price recovered to $20 and continue to bleed at this very moment, eventually they will have to throw in the towel. Despite what you may read on this forum from very motivated autists with good intentions, it is impossible to know when exactly the squeeze will happen because that is up to the hedgies themselves. **All I know is that right now the tsunami alarms are going off and all hedge funds must be evacuated. Because the Big Wave is building up at this very moment and will inevitably hit the shores.** Thanks for reading this until the end. Stay healthy, stay safe and most of all: hold GME because *you like the stock*.

Obligatory: this is not financial advice. Position: 31 shares @ $16.3

Title: Unjustifiable Bearish
UPDATE:

 All you need to do is look at the options contracts for this Friday to see what manipulation is going on. This will pin to 13.50 top 14.00 a share. PEOPLE STOP BUYING CALLS, buy the stock not the options. As long as the options continue, the Market Makers will steal your money by holding back the stock price. 

Macys is a department store operator with a market cap of $4.7B. If you look at its business the four years prior to 2020, it was fairly stable with revenues during that 4 year period ranging from $25.3-25.9B with EBITDA greater than $2.1B for each year during that period. They were aggressively deleveraging during this period having reduced debt from $7.6B to $4.2B (these number exclude capital leases). Then in 2020, the COVID crisis occurred and Macys business suffered mightily as stores were closed due to local restrictions. Management took a number of actions such as raising additional cash, suspending the dividend, cutting CAPEX, closing unprofitable stores, reducing inventory and cutting SG&amp;A. In 2020, sales will likely end up being down about 30% to $17.8B with EBITDA being slightly positive (\~$50M). But I would argue that 2020 will be the trough in revenues and earnings for Macys. As we move into 2021 and the pandemic mitigates, people will return to shopping in stores and Macys sales will start to show Y/Y positive comps as they progress through the year. Current average analyst expectations for 2021 call for M to make $0.65/share.

However, I believe that Wall Street is way too bearish on this company. Currently 6 analysts rate Macys as a sell with one brave analyst going positive on the company in December with a Buy rating. But if you look at the last two earnings releases, Macys blew away analysts weak expectations by wide margins with upside surprises of $0.96/share in Q2 and $0.60/share in Q3. With this bearish slant, I believe M will blow away expectations again in Q4. The average analyst expectation only calls for earnings of $0.04/share in the holiday quarter. But I project they will make just shy of $1/share (ex. items) assuming sales come in about $6.7B. Part of the reason for the bearish stance is many of these analysts clients are short Macys stock.

One of the biggest arguments shorts make is the Macys in too indebted with high interest debt. But at the end of Q3, M had $1.55B in cash on the balance sheet and had net debt of only $3.8B. The cash level will only improve coming out of the holiday quarter where EBITDA will be greater than $700M. When revenues return to normalized levels, the debt level is &lt;2x EBITDA. With the cash on the balance sheet, they have ample liquidity to cover interest payments of $80M/quarter. Also, no significant debt maturities are coming due in the next couple years that are not already covered by existing cash and future cash flows. Some of Ms debt is secure by their real estate holdings which is valued at double the current market cap of the company.

When I look at how they compare against competitors, their stock price currently is priced at a discount. Macys sells for a P/S of 0.24 compared with Kohls (0.42), Dillards (0.43) or Nordstroms (0.51). One could argue that share price should be selling for around $30/share to have comparable valuations. But I would argue that Macys should have a higher multiple due to their e-Commerce business which made up 38% of sales in the most recent quarter growing at a 27% Y/Y clip. Macys is currently the 10th largest e-Commerce retailer in the US (Amazon is #1 and sports a 4.5 P/S). If I look at those on the list that are slightly bigger players, all are brick &amp; mortars and sport much higher P/S ratios, #7 Best Buy (0.62), #8 Target (1.04) and #9 Costco (0.91). If valued with a similar P/S ratio, Macys should sell for $38-65/share.

Part of the reason Macys share price is depressed is because it is heavily shorted. Currently over 28% of the float is short the stock. The shorts are unjustifiable bearish on a company that is undervalued compared to its peer even though has a greater e-Commerce presence and will be returning to profitability in 2021 post COVID. But I think other players in the market will exploit this heavily shorted situation in the near term by pushing the shares higher. Heavy buying of Feb. 19 calls would suggest the price will be pushed higher ahead of the companys earnings release which will likely happen late in February. If Q4 earnings exceed analyst expectations by a large margin as I expect, we could see a short squeeze due to the heavy short interest.

We will see what happens with Macys this month and longer term. My contention is it is worth a lot more than $15/share, more realistically it is worth $30-40/share, which is why I am long.

Title: FINRA Data - Past Couple Days - GME
So i aggregated some FINRA data for past few days, and the shorts have been going to town on GME. If I am reading this correctly. Seeing the price is going down and the short volume is 50% or greater most days, it looks like they are increasing their position for sure. I believe 6pm tonight is when new official short interest data comes out.

Basically, they keep shorting we keep holding, they will have to give out eventually given the interest one way or another. I did hear on another post these may be synthetic shorts but have a timeline as well.

Not a financial advisor, i am retarded, this is not advice to buy or sell anything.

Title: GME On The NYSE SHO List - Naked Shorts Can Be Forced To Cover Starting Friday
GME has been on the NYSE SHO list for 10 days now because of sellers failing to deliver their stocks (naked shorts).

When a stock has been on this list for 13 consecutive settlement days, brokers can be forced to cover open shorts by buying the missing shares. GME has been on the list since January 19. The 13th consecutive day for GME would be Thursday, February  4. That means naked short positions could start being forced to buy and close positions on Friday.

Title: $APHA $TLRY DD
Hello everyone. 

Yesterday I posted a DD on Tilray and why it was headed to the moon. Link below.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lail27/tlry_dd/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Im returning today to inform everyone about how the $TLRY and $APHA merger happening Q2 will work. 

Based on the terms of the merger, $APHA owners will receive 83% of their $APHA shares as $TLRY stock. For all you smooth brains, this means that $APHA should be 83% of whatever $TLRY stock price is on a given day. This is currently not the case.

I have predicted that $TLRY will moon based on short interest and other DD. Link above. This means that $APHA is discounted and will follow this move. So smart money will buy $APHA to take advantage of this discount along with the impending moon of $TLRY.

Hope this helps. Dont miss out. I have linked a screenshot of shorts in $TLRY below.

Title: Elon Musk trying to distract retail from Silver with recent tweets - $TSLA $SLV connection
The gist: Elon Musk is trying to distract potential silver buyers with his recent tweets.  More details below, based on 3 observations.

**Disclaimer: This is my DD, hence the flair.  Please do your own research. Disclosures below. This is not financial advice.**

Three observations:

1)	Elon Musk is increasingly praising a specific financial instrument on his twitter

2)	Musk needs a serious amount of silver for several of his holdings: SolarCity (owned by Tesla), SpaceX, and Tesla

3)	Musk has a history of sending out tweets that wind up changing prices of assets


Breakdown:

1) Elon Musk is hyping something on Twitter, talking about how it is on the verge of being accepted. If money goes into that thing because people anticipate a spike in value, it can't go into buying up silver metals.

Source (Elon Musk's Twitter):

2) Musk needs silver metal for many reasons: solar panels for SolarCity (owned by Tesla), solar panels for Space X satellites, electrical conductors for EVs (Tesla).  Musk wants the price of silver to stay as low as possible, since his companies will need to buy it for industrial purposes regardless. 

Sources:

SolarCity:

https://www.streetwisejournal.com/5-reasons-silver-is-gaining-in-value/  

https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/solar-driven-silver-demand-set-to-dim-as-sector-innovates-60533352

&lt;- States that Solarcity (and others) are seeking to move from Silver to Copper, which is cheaper, but has not done yet.  Most photovoltaic cells still need silver to be built, though this may change by 2028.

SpaceX: All these satellites have 1 solar panel, and likely use silver for internal electrical components + electrical shielding.

Tesla:
https://goldsilver.com/blog/why-elon-musk-secretly-loves-silver/#:~:text=Electric%20cars%20and%20trucks%20require,management%20system%20all%20require%20silver. &lt;-- Claiming EVs use more silver than combustion cars.

https://banyanhill.com/silver-rally-tesla-cybertruck/ &lt;-- Same as above.

https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-01-13/The-surprising-driver-of-future-silver-demand.html &lt;Same as above.

**So what?**
If the price of silver skyrockets, so does the cost of manufacturing solar panels (for Earth and Space) and EVs, all of which eats into $TSLA's margins, as it owns SolarCity and uses silver for electrical components (also SpaceX's). 

So Musk, in my opinion, is understandably trying to get as many impressionable retail traders over to another safe haven ASAP **so that they DONT go into silver.**  And that's why he's pressing it so hard.
  

And I love the guy, but he does have a history of tweeting things and then prices swinging around them (#TSLA420YOLO). Silver has a lot of strong pressures to buy right now, short and long term, and **Musk knows this**, and he would prefer to avoid a major spike if possible, since his companies will need to buy silver no matter what: you can't just sub in another metal right away.


**TL;DR**: If silver goes through the roof, solar panels, satellites (panels + internal components), and  EVs become more expensive to make, all bad news for $TSLA.  Theorizing Musk is pushing another safe haven on his twitter as a distraction, hoping to divert retail funds and thus dodging a silver price retail surge from hell. 


Disclosures: I am long and currently hold positions in $PSLV, $AG, and silver mining company ETFs, $TSLA via ARKK, and 4 silver dollars my great uncle gave me when I was a kid. I also hold a small position in what Elon's pushing. 


This is not financial advice or DD, please do your own research.  5 year club, not a bot yet.

Title: CORSAIR TO THE MOON?!
So my last post simply talked about my play on Corsair and there seemed to be a lot of disagreement so here's my actual DD behind it. Also before we get into this, for all the Logitech nerds on my last post, nobody cares that your mom bought you a $10 Logitech keyboard and you like the noises it makes, it doesn't change the fact that Corsair have better quality products for pretty much everything besides mice(my opinion).

&amp;#x200B;

Ok so first things first, we all know that the gaming industry as a whole had boomed due to COVID and has had an increasing TAM for quite some time now and is projected to continue its growth. For that reason alone I'm bullish on a lot of gaming companies other than a few that I believe have way too high of a valuation.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets start with marketing. If any of you have as poor of a social life as I since COVID started then you'd know that Corsair has been very active in social media marketing/sponsorships on Twitch. It feels like I keep seeing more and more streamers show sponsor slides of Corsair gear. This is amazing because in my personal opinion, I believe Twitch and YouTube sponsorships is easily one of the best ways to promote your products(referring to gaming products only). Just look at recent games that have all blown up, Fortnite, Apex Legends, Warzone, and Rust have all blown up due to their large presence on Twitch. Apex Legends and Rust quite literally paid streamers to play the game and look at how well that worked out for them.

&amp;#x200B;

Next up we'll take a look at financials, don't worry I'm not going to sit here and tell you to do your full in depth fundamental analysis reasoning report but I do think we should at least pay attention to it. Even before COVID and still during COVID Corsair has increased revenues, net income, and cash flow. This just adds extra proof that its not like Corsair was a failing company before they got the boost from COVID. Another major positive would be that Corsair has increased focus around R&amp;D which has only proven to significantly help tech companies move ahead of their competitors and acquire more market share. Just a couple companies that also focused R&amp;D would be Tesla(all praise father Elon) and AMD. There's obviously more to the financial aspect however I'd rather not sit here and type out their entire 10-K in a reddit post.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, I think with all DD you must point out the negatives as you go along. As I stated before, Logitech definitely beats Corsair when it comes to mice. However, I typed this entire post without using a mouse so who really cares about mice. Secondly, Corsair's CEO is Andy Paul. How can you put a billion dollar company in the hands of a man with two first names and to be honest, I don't know how they do it. Although that is definitely a big negative, their logo is extremely cool which I think makes up for it.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your time, now lets preheat this oven and start baking some tendies!

&amp;#x200B;

Note: Logitech fanboys please don't attack me in the comments, I don't care about your mice, just leave me alone and go play pong or something with your amazing mouse.

Title: Some more DD for your BB (part 2)
Good 'whatever time of day it is for you' Autists,

As a follow-up to my post yesterday about BB, I wanted to attempt to place some of your worries at ease as many of you may be having second thoughts about your investments.  A link to my post yesterday will be provided at the end.

Yes, BB is dipping . However, please keep in mind that it is not dipping as hard as GME or AMC. There are reasons for this. BB had growth potential based on recent changes and it was never meant to be part of the current madness because the short interest just wasn't there compared to others.

It is apparent that of the BANG gang, AMC and GME got more media coverage than the rest despite having \*relatively\* less news than BB.  Referring to the premise of my DD yesterday, BB is a value play and NOT a get rich quick or anything play of the sort. This is a company that is reinventing their place in the corporate world, moving from phones to software development.  My smooth brain is holding on, even if it goes back to $7 because I believe in this company to reach new highs within the next year. 

If you invested yesterday after reading about how great I said BB is, I am sorry you can't buy a new Rolex today and you will need to go to Popeyes for your chicken tendies. However, that post was not meant to imply you would be posting gains porn by the end of the week. 

What we are seeing is likely a combination of paper hands getting scared of the pullback, and a correction in the stock after an unsustainable momentous gain based on the present value of the company. As they grow into their new position and make more and more deals to get their technology in everything, the stock will likely raise with it. When will this happen? Impossible to say, but the future looks bright. 

Before the recent momentum, BB was trading around $7.43. Even after the last few red days, BB is still holding over $11.50. Sure, this isn't as great as &gt;$25, but like other stocks that go parabolic, there is an inevitable pull back. 

TL;DR - Stop being mad at your BB losses. Paper hands are for the weak. 

(Not financial advice, I am just a regular dude)

Prior BB post -  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lacbau/some\_dd\_for\_your\_bb/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lacbau/some_dd_for_your_bb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Good luck and may tendies rain down

Title: Finally, some good news!
As we all know, the short ladder attacks have been consistent since last week.

The Hedge funds don't want us to win.

But today I discovered something whilst my wife was fucking her boyfriend,

If you look here on [NYSE website](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse-arca/notices)

click the 'short sale restriction list' you will see a bunch of spreadsheets with stocks including GME.

Because I have a brain as smooth as an F1 car, this means that as of the 3rd of February 2021 (tomorrow),  **~~GME will no longer be under the threat of a short ladder attack~~****.**

EDIT-         **Shorts will have to close positions tomorrow.**

A direct link to the spreadsheet which includes GME is linked [here](ftp://ftp.nyxdata.com/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers_2021/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers_202102/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers20210201.xls)

**But why?**

**There is a naughty list for stocks that have been fucked due to shorts**

Directly quoting [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/thresholdlist.asp),

A threshold list, also known as a Regulation SHO Threshold Security List, is a list of securities whose transactions failed to clear during the previous trading days.Threshold lists are published in accordance with regulations set out by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Regulators review this information as part of their efforts to detect **market manipulation**.

* A threshold list is a list of securities that failed to settle in the previous five trading days.
* They are published by various exchanges in accordance with SEC regulations.
* These settlement failures may be indicative of naked short selling, although they may also be caused by benign factors, such as administrative errors."

Also, if you read on the official [SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#:~:text=Rule%20204%20%E2%80%93%20Close%2Dout%20Requirement,of%20like%20kind%20and%20quantity), 

" 

* *Rule 204  Close-out Requirement*. Rule 204 requires brokers and dealers that are participants of a registered clearing agency[\[8\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn8) to take action to close out failure to deliver positions. Closing out requires the broker or dealer to purchase or borrow securities of like kind and quantity. The participant must close out a failure to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+4. If a participant has a failure to deliver that the participant can demonstrate on its books and records resulted from a long sale, or that is attributable to bona fide market making activities, the participant must close out the failure to deliver by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+6. If the position is not closed out, the broker or dealer and any broker or dealer for which it clears transactions (for example, an introducing broker)[\[9\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn9) may not effect further short sales in that security without borrowing or entering into a bona fide agreement to borrow the security (known as the pre-borrowing requirement) until the broker or dealer purchases shares to close out the position and the purchase clears and settles. In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out failures to deliver in securities with large and persistent failures to deliver, referred to as threshold securities, if the failures to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.[\[10\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn10) Threshold securities are equity securities[\[11\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn11) that have an aggregate fail to deliver position for five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency (e.g., National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC)); totaling 10,000 shares or more; and equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer's total shares outstanding. As provided in Rule 203 of Regulation SHO, threshold securities are included on a list disseminated by a self-regulatory organization (SRO). Although as a result of compliance with Rule 204, generally a participants fail to deliver positions will not remain for 13 consecutive settlement days, if, for whatever reason, a participant of a registered clearing agency has a fail to deliver position at a registered clearing agency in a threshold security for 13 consecutive settlement days, the requirement to close-out such position under Rule 203(b)(3) remains in effect.

Title: Excellent academic paper on clearing and how naked short sellers can fail to deliver with little consequence !
I found this paper incredibly informative on how the system is totally rigged so that naked short sellers don't have to actually deliver the shares when called upon to! They can simply fail to deliver for a long time and get away with it.

Title: Part 3- $BB DD no Meems  FUCK THE MEMES
If I have to see another fucking message about todays drop Im going steal some $ROPE from all the $GME bagholders so Im going to address some questions here. FYI [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/) and [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamill/bb_dd_no_meems_part_2/) of this autistic $BB diatribe [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamill/bb_dd_no_meems_part_2/), not going to keep answering the same questions.

As many in the #BANG GANG have always known, $BB becoming a meme stock has been a **mixed** blessing, to say the least. to say the most, it's fucking sucked.

Look at this chart. Look at this fucking chart. I dont need to run a regression, lets be just as retarded as all the candle-stick reading dipshits with a Bloomberg terminal (*#Ben Graham GANG# FOREVER AND ALWAYS)* \- Look at the lines, and how theyre moving together. Try to wrinkle that smooth brain of yours for a second.

**Why THE FUCK would an (a) Endpoint / digital security company, a vidya retailer (yeah, sure they sell funko pops too now great ), a movie chain (half of you morons have 3 streaming subscriptions and last I checked youre not allowed to watch in your underwear while getting tendie crumbs everywhere @ AMC), and some Fininsh 5(g) provider (I dont know a fucking thing about NOK) move in tandem other than just being meme stocks on this fucking board?**

By the way - There's been a ton of great technical analysis posted on the others in $BANG. the short squeeze on GME was real and a once-in-a-lifetime catch and i respect the hell out of it (and am also a sad bagholder of a few shares). It's just that the reasons for liking each of the stocks is different.

For better or worse - There was a post, I cant find it but somebody else can, that showed the Robinhood dashboard that basically said the three most commonly held shares in any given account was, you guessed it $BB, $AMC, and $GGME.

As you know, Mark Cuban took a break from his busy calendar of being the least retarded Sharktank (No offense Daymond John, I have a soft spot for FUBU but my wifes boyfriend no longer lets me rock it) and touching tips with Luka Doncic to [answer some questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/hey_everyone_its_mark_cuban_jumping_on_to_do_an/). Somebody asked why $GME was taking a nose dive off of Mt. Everest. Per Cuban -

*Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand. They created a RobinHood Dive. No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers. Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.*

*Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls. When that margin call happens, its brutal. They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.*

So. Two things re: $BBs volatility.

# #1 Stopping buys (but allowing sales) tanked $BB, just like it tanked the other meme stocks. The tin foil apes can keep hawking about citadel etc. but the truth is likely that RObinhood is a tech-focused firm with shitty financial controls and even shittier risk management (GUH). Never ascribe to malice what is usually (and always with that shitshow of an excuse of a company) incompetence. Those dumbasses had a liquidity problem and solved it in the worst way possible. I hope their IPO fails and Vlad steps on a lego.

# #2. The current free fall of $GME / $AMC is still dragging $BB down. Why? What happens when people get margin called? Their entire account sells off some or all of a portion to satisfy the account. For those of you more discerning retards you know that the same thing happened to the hedge funds last week.

**Its called** [**degrossing**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-30/a-reddit-army-descends-on-hedge-funds-chained-by-risk-models?sref=NJllTNWZ)**,** and is what caused the broader market to perform **inversely** to $BANG.

*BTW - It was really fantastic for me to watch my MSFT calls get fucked because of the morons of this sub. Satya Nadella daddy dicked earnings and the stock (along with the whole fucking market) was downLive by the retard, die by the retard. But look at the bounceback this this week, when all the hedge funds looked around and said  Wait, J. Powell is still printing money like Zimbabwe and stocks only go up.*

***What do you think will happen once things calm down, the stimulus checks hit, and retail investors start looking around again for stocks they might like?***

So now what? Well, I REPEAT, **wrinkle that smooth brain of yours. What does #1 and #2 have to do with the** [actual reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4ehan/blackberry_dd/) **that #BANG GANG likes $BB?**

If you said  "Huh, not much" then congrats youve evolved slightly beyond a retarded monkey playing at a slot machine and shitting out sub-par memes.

**TLDR - $BB WENT DOWN TODAY BECAUSE OF FACTORS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO ITS STATUS AS A MEME STOCK. $BB $BANG GANG EATs WILD DAILY PRICE SWINGS FOR BREAKFAST. THE BIGGEST LESSON OF GME / AMC IS THAT RETARDS TOGETHER STRONG. ON THE OFF CHANCE THAT ENOUGH RETARDS BELIEVE, IT EVEN HAS A CHANCE TO ROCKET AGAIN IN THE SHORT TERM.**

**TLDR the TLDR - $BB #BANG GANG IS IN FOR THE LONG HAUL. WERE TERRAFORMING MARS, AND TAKING MATT DAMON WITH US.**

POS  balls deep in $BB shares, planning to buy more today

Title: GEVO will be a winner in 2021
\*not a financial advisor - just my personal opinion\*

Mad about what happened today and trying to recoup losses into and then some throughout the rest of the year? I might have a play for you that could 4x your current investment. I consider myself in a lot of ways to be an investor that spends a lot of time research high-growth stocks that have a clear market fit/product that will grow into the future. I was actually an early investor in NIO at $12 a share and sold around the $55 dollar mark with 4x profits. I like NIO, but I feel that the general EV market is in a bubble considering we are still years and years away from EV adoption in all cars. If you asked the EV manufacturers to supply the entire American public with EV cars and infrastructure - it would be impossible as they cannot scale and produce that rapidly. With NIO in particular - I mainly sold because I see the renewable energy stocks to have a more promising future in 2021 than EV cars since it's going to take them time to scale, and I don't expect them to repeat the same success in 2021.

Where did I put that profit? I put it right into GEVO as I believe BioFuels are the most sensible short-medium term solution for the world we live in. I am not crazy how GEVOs revenue numbers have been in the last few years, but I'm going to let that slide because of environmental/political factors that will sure to make it a major player in the future. On top of that, Biden elected the former co-founder of GEVO into his science cabinet which only increases my confidence. Right now, GEVO has $500M+ in cash on hand, zero debt, and over a billion dollars worth in potential contract value.

If you've been following the news - you would see how the big oil companies are growing concerned regarding regulations on the new administration - as even they see the writing on the wall. What I predict is, GEVO has the renewable patent technology they could license to these oil companies. Big Oil will partner with proven technologies before trying to re-invent the wheel (look at what happened with FCEL and Exxon). Big Oils conversion to clean energy is going to need to happen - and I'm expecting GEVO to land some partners soon.

I am currently holding 1600 shares at a cost average in the high 9s and feel that GEVO on the low end is $30 by end of year, and $60-70 on the high end. I think a lot of partnerships will start popping up soon and new adoptions in the green energy space by the Biden administration will cause this to really pop.

Title: This subreddit contains the majority of the board of directors with being high quantity shareholders of $GME.
Yes, we like the stock but this is also a side effect of having people like u/deepfuckingvalue and u/potato_in_my_ass who hold tens of thousands of shares.

$GME has to connect with all who own a large enough position within the company, even if they bought the stock just because they like the stock. That shows that the shareholders are more likely to want to help $GME to grow and grow the companys profits. 

To those waiting on the GME board making some sort of statement, this is likely why its not happened yet. 

I am not a financial advisor, just a recent college grad with two bachelors in Business Admin.

Edit: I remember u/potato_in_my_ass being one of the big guys with DFV at the beginning. I mayve wrote the username incorrectly. It was mentioned in an article I read a week ago or so.

Edit 2: fixed dfvs name as I had an s at the end, and check comment about why I said potato in my ass cuz I was under impression it was a quiet version of DFV

Edit 3: this was a response to someones comment about me posting this as a DD and having a simple name misspelling and being under impression that the other user I mentioned being a big time diamond hand:

         This due diligence is a response to the posts and comments Ive been reading on here in relation to people wanting to see a statement of sorts from GMEs board of directors while also those users bringing up the possibility of a stock offering by GME.

Once you become a stockholder and are able to vote on things, that info gained from such meetings and votes is what is considered to be insider information and if a stockholder sells due to such information being given to them legally, is an illegal action as it is not the true reason behind why one should buy a stock.

What is that one true reason behind buying a stock? Its that you LIKE the stock. You LIKE the company. You LIKE that industry, and specifically that company within it.

People who buy a stock to just profit off of it in a short term, or to just profit off of the companys bankruptcy, is a poor excuse of a human as they are wanting others to lose their jobs. Buying a piece of a company is/should only be for those who want to see the company do well, or enjoy the products and services offered by such company.

Title: This says the short interest of GME is 36%, as of 2pm. If thats true, whats the actual play if youre holding?
https://finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/gamestop-extends-pullback-short-interest-083934905.html

Im not a bot. 

I like the stock. 

Im holding my measly handful of shares of GME to be a part of the movement. 

I tuned into Mark Cubans AMA and got wood at him saying hold if you can afford to. 

That all being, if the short interest truly is 36%, what is left of the original play toward a gamma squeeze. The only reason this play was ever a play to begin with was because of the 120%+ short interest GME originally had. 

Some say the squeeze is yet to come, some say it happened last Thursday. 

To those truly holding, how truly confident are you that this will still rise? And, if its not about the short interest, then what is your play for holding?

Title: WSB POTENTIAL FOR ACTIVISM IN GME?
As I write this GME is trading at \~$103/sh with a $7.2B market cap.

I'm writing this to talk about GME objectively, not that "to the moon"  or "10k isn't a meme" bullshit or some stupid misplaced crusade against wall street. I'm here to make money.

Right now GME has $586M in CACE ($140M of which is restricted so really $446M to do whatever they want with). Their assets have shrunk most notably from writing down almost $2 BILLION in goodwill over the last couple years. Right now the company has ZERO in goodwill, basically saying it's brand is worthless. I disagree with this after the hype WSB has created for this company. On the liability side, as of Q320, they have $224M and $216M in s-t and l-t debt, respectively, for total debt of $450M.

**GME PLEASE ISSUE STOCK.**

I know it will dilute the shit out of SHs and drop the price but I think it would be a huge buying opportunity. The fact that they haven't already is incomprehensible and arguably negligent. They could've issued 4-5M shares when this thing was over $300 at $200-250/sh and brought in $1B cash. But that's irrelevant now. What they could do is still issue stock, I'm not sure what price they could get for it but I'd be a buyer. Let's say they issue 5M shares at $100/sh, that's $500M cash... $500M would be HUGE in transforming the business. Up that to 10M shares and they bring in $1B. I think $1B is &gt; than $500M but I'm wetahded.

So I titled this "WSB POTENTIAL FOR ACTIVISM IN GME?" because collectively we own a shitload of shares. Could we not push for the company to issue stock here? Could we not send a letter to GME like HFs do but with ****.

They could use $250M to pay down debt and the other half to really catalyze the transformation.

Video gaming is a growth industry and yes, brick and mortar is slowing dying, but as DFV said in his original thesis, that's a long way off.

GME needs to use the hype that WSB CULTIVATED for its brand and capitalize on it. The company couldn't have asked for a better xmas present than what's happening now. People are buying fucking billboards for GME. The company could be to gaming, what Chewy (a &gt;$40B market cap) is to the pet industry. And clearly Ryan Cohen feels this way, too. GME needs to entrench itself into the gamer lifestyle and I really think raising funds now would accelerate this.

**Financials**

Right now I'm estimating GME will make $5B in revenues in 2020, so we're trading at 1.4x depressed revenues. For comparison CHWY trades at \~6x revenue, per yahoo finance. This is a company that made &gt;$8B in 2018 and 2017.

They recently reported holiday sales (Nov and Dec) of $1.7B, down 1.9% yoy with 11% less stores open. SSS comps +4.8% yoy. But here's the most positive, digital sales were +309% yoy, and $1.35B ytd. As digital sales grow, this should help alleviate SG&amp;A expenses which have historically crushed profitability. In 2017, 2018, and 2019 SG&amp;A was $2B, and for 2020 it's looking like it'll be \~$1.4-1.5B.

**Valuation**

This is a very basic back-of-envelope calculation. But if GME can return to \~$8B in revenues (which is entirely possible and reasonable IF they can execute). And maintains historic GM's of \~30%, we get $2.4B in gross profit. And if digital sales continue to make up a larger chunks of revenues and they close redundant stores, they should be able to keep that SG&amp;A expense under $2B. Let's say they can get it to $1.6B, which is about $100-150M above what SG&amp;A will probably be this year (accounting for store reopenings).

So $8B revenues, 30% GM, $2.4B gross profit, $1.6B SG&amp;A = $800M in operating income.

Assuming \~30% tax rate =&gt; $560M in net income.

If this plays out, we're currently trading at \~12.9x ($7.2B/$560M) what could be a reasonable net income # in the next couple years. My point is that GME might not be as overvalued as people think...

Anyways, please call me out on any bullshit in my thinking/logic.

Title: Each $GME share is basically a blank check
The billionaires and hedge funds screwed up big time and they know they're fucked. The autists of wallstreetbets here are battle hardened vets that have been through wars. A lot of us have lost 99% before. These dips are when we buy more. We're in a historic moment here. The hedge funds know they're fucked.

Theoretically each share could be worth an infinite amount of dollars. If no one sells, that's the price they'll have to pay. I think it's time these hedge funds billionaires lost their yachts and mansions and have to live in a normal house like the rest us. This is a moment where we're taking back what they took.

Realistically we can probably get $35,000 a share on average. This would put GameStop roughly around the same market cap as Apple. It could go up to $50,000 a share. Anything is possible.

This is not investment advice and is for entertainment purposes only.

Title: Reverse gamma squeeze incoming
Hello fellow bag holders

Here's my shitty DD, take it with a ton of salt cause I actually, truly have no idea what I'm talking about

&amp;#x200B;

**Thesis:** 

This Friday and next Monday/Tues is going to experience the drop of all drops for GME due to expiring options being HEAVILY skewed towards puts

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at the yahoo options chain ([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME&amp;straddle=true](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME&amp;straddle=true)) and we end the week around the current price (say, $107):

&amp;#x200B;

Total calls expiring ITM (strike price &lt;= 105) : 16,337

Total puts expiring ITM (strike price &gt;= 110) : 25,797

Net difference : 9460 more put contracts expire ITM, leading to an added **946,000 shares worth of selling pressure** 

On top of this selling pressure, similar to the gamma squeeze we saw on the way up with MMs buying shares as prices increase to cover the calls they wrote, **they will be selling shares as prices drop** to cover/hedge puts they wrote which are now ITM

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea if this makes sense

**Position:** GME 19Feb21 110 P 

Lost money on the way up, lets see if I can lose money on the way down also

Title: A simpleton's case for why EXPI can go up 100%+ in the near future.
# *This is not financial advice. I eat yellow snow. Proceed at your own risk. 

***Of course hold GME*** but it's always a good idea to stay aware of other things that are going on.\*

I am a simple man. I will make a simple case for EXPI. 

1- If any industry is primed for disruption it is real estate brokerages. Information is becoming more and more available. Who the fuck wants to keep paying 6% commission so some college drop out can unlock a door and read some info off of a sheet? Nobody. Real estate agents can go get in the go fuck yourself line right behind the investment firms. We don't need them anymore. It's not 1985 anymore. 

2- Lets look at EXPI and how it's financials compare to two of its peers. Redfin and Zillow.

# Market Caps

Expi- 8.4b

RDFN- 8.2b

Z- 34b

# Net income

Expi- Profitable

RDFN- Not profitable

Z- Not profitable

# Revenue

RDFN's has half the revenue of EXPI

Z has slightly less then double the revenue of expi

# Simpleton's Math

Redfin has half the revenue and is not profitable and yet it has the same market cap as expi.

Z has 4x expi's market cap but only 2x the revenue. And its not profitable.

Even a dumbass like me can see that expi is trading way below the value of it's peers. A fair market cap would be around 16b which would put the stock price around $240. It's currently trading at $120

Title: The Journey To Green TENDIES Through Green Energy (ICLN) - Jan 2021
Alright, attention fellow autists. After a year of lurking in this sub, I've decided that it is finally my time to start a YOLO journey. Now, to make tendies in the future what do we need? That's right, fucking clean energy to cook my tendies of course. I don't want no tendies from fucking dirty oil and pollution, that shit's disgusting. Only boomers eat that tendies. May the power of fresh wind, sunlight, water and energy cook up the finest of tendies for me.

My positions in ICLN:

&amp;#x200B;

[My position](https://preview.redd.it/apn4b9fe14f61.jpg?width=946&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67cc6a5415a451605e089ce77e8983d5e818eaa0)

I don't know what the fuck I'm doing but here's my Ding Dong:

* ICLN debuted in 2008 with the highest price of 60$/share during the time of oil fear but quickly got dumped back down over several years. The stock is currently trading at around 30$, only half from the peak.

[ICLN Timeline](https://preview.redd.it/5g9sw9hf14f61.png?width=1224&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ec7ca2c10425c1a5de851872324fa0fe898c8e6)

* **But here's the catch**. Back in 2008, the renewable energy industry was literal trash. The technologies at the time were expensive and inefficient. Miniscule progress was made even with huge subsidies from many countries. Fast forward 12+ years and with improvement in technologies, prices for renewable energy have been significantly reduced -&gt; more adoptions from the average households.

[Prices for various renewable energies](https://preview.redd.it/0um3rmoj14f61.jpg?width=959&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08b89572ee4e2530ab5bbd396175a73d1eab8d26)

* Many companies in the industry are quickly growing in size and turning profitable. Amongst ICLN's holdings, there are: Enphase Energy $ENPH (which doubled in size from 2018-2019), Verbund AG (largest hydropower provider in Austria), big solar players like First Solar $FSLR, SolarEdge $SEDG, Sunrun $RUN, and some other foreign companies.

* Biden's Green Energy policies include plans to move the United States to 100% clean energy by 2050, boost jobs in the renewable energy industry, and up to $5 TRILLION incentives over the next 10 years. [https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/](https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/)
* Search results for 'clean energy' on the rise worldwide according to Google Trend.

* Premiums still cheap as fuck with 2023 call options only around $500-800$.

I will be holding this position for at least a year and will be adding more on major dips. I will also update this position monthly to the sub. Join me on this crusade for a brighter, greener, and richer future. This shit literally can't go tits up.

TLDR and positions:

Buy $ICLN and HOLD to GREEN TENDIES . ICLN $45 Call Jan 20, 2023

Title: $MACE - Mace Security International DD
My first DD post. Sources in comments.

tl;dr: Given current situation and positive changes implemented by the management team I see $*MACE* having a great future (personal safety and security industry is projected to reach USD 5,5kkk by the end of 2025, registering annual CAGR of 11.00%. Growth is fueled by political changes, worsening climate situation and changes in human behavior). This is one is to hold for long time. Im not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice.

Longer Version

My investment strategy is finding a stock that will perform well in medium/long term. I usually try to take profits or cut losses within one year, so look for companies that should benefit from what is happening around the world (be it Covid, civil unrests, green revolution, semiconductors scarcity). Today Ill share my opinion about personal safety and security industry in light of current events.

Guns in USA  Democrats have control, RNA went bankrupt, society at large agrees on stricter gun laws. In near future this might result in policy changes that makes it more difficult for people to get lethal weapons as means of self defense. However, a need for self defense is not going away any time soon and heres why:

 We have seen that during the recent civil unrest weapons and ammunitions sales skyrocketed. I think that fundamental issues which fueled these events are not going away anytime soon. Portland still rumbling in protests and Q is searching for space lasers People will want to protect themselves  pepper spray or stun gun is better than nothing if gun laws change.

 Covid lockdowns and restrictions pushed people to spend more alone in the nature. You know who else is in the nature? Bears! Demand in animal deterrent sprays should increase.

 All the talks about defunding and rebuilding police. Sounds like there is a room to expand use of non-lethal weapons in most situations.

 Dating world. Online dating accounts for most dates out there and that introduces risk of meeting some creepy person. Demand for personal safety alarms should increase. Good LinkedIn post on this: **Source 1**

 Climate change creates a lot of wealth disparity that fuels societal disorder. Throw on top of that explosive mix of economical, Covid, political issues and in my opinion what we are seeing now around the world is just the beginning of new normal. Critical mass of anger is achieved and this wont go down so smoothly. When theres anger on the streets people look to defend themselves.

In my opinion all of these are external catalysts for personal safety industry. Now about $*MACE*, one of the old timers in this industry.

**Company**: Mace Security International, Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells personal defense and security products to retailers, distributors, and individual consumers worldwide. Brands: Mace, Tornado, Vigilant and Take Down. The company distributes and supports its branded products and services through mass market retailers, wholesale distributors, independent dealers, e-commerce channels, and installation service providers. Headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. [https://www.mace.com/](https://www.mace.com/)

**History:** Founded in 1965, but it looks like company has lost its way at some point  $*MACE* had carwashes as their line of business up till 2013 (**Source 2**). Old management team neglected companys online presence, so brand and sales suffered. Not much else to say here.

**Now**: new management team since 2019. Has been working on changes and got struck with Covid shenanigans, but is adapting quickly to a current environment. Recognizes missed online opportunities and now is focusing on online sales. Q3 increase in online sales compared to Q2 is in triple digits (meaning 100%+) (**Source 3**, **Source 4**)

Check out their amazon shop  has lots of positive reviews.

When searching for best pepper spray, best animal deterrent I find articles, posts with Mace products. That leads me to think that online exposure has improved a lot and there will be large number of people getting same results when looking for self-defense products.

**Latest Financial Results**: Q3 2020

Net sales increased $2,310,000 or 94% versus prior year, primarily driven by organic growth, addition of new customers both in retail and e-commerce segments and new product line extensions at retailers.  
Gross profit for the third quarter increased by $1,016,000 or 108% over the same period in the prior year, driven primarily by increased sales volume, labor efficiencies, and higher margin digital sales.  
SG&amp;A expenses increased by $177,000 to $1,183,000 for the quarter, or 25% of net sales, driven primarily by higher variable sales commissions and performance-related incentives. Net income increased by $843,000.  
Cash and cash equivalents increased to $549,000 as of September 30, 2020, an increase of $242,000 over the $307,000 on hand on December 31, 2019. Working capital increased by $1,860,000 compared to December 31, 2019. The company paid off its loan in the amount of $600,000 on September 30, 2020.  
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $889,000 (1.4 cents per share on an undiluted basis for the quarter).  
From earnings call transcript: **Source 5** (I recommend to go through it  gives nice outlook on new management team results and their future plans)

**Recent Catalyst**: Protest in US and increased demand in personal defense products, 94% revenue increase in Q3 vs last year, 2021 OTCQX Best 50 award (**Source 6**), one-year $2.0 million Revolving Credit Agreement with Fifth Third Bank (meaning cash on tap: **Source 7**)

**Upcoming $*****MACE*** **Catalysts**: New product launch in Q1 2021 (mentioned in call transcript above), FY 2020 results (which due to all recent political tensions should show even better results than those reported for Q2 and Q3)

**Upcoming Industry Catalysts**: Personal safety and security industry is projected to reach USD 5,5kkk by the end of 2025, registering annual CAGR of 11.00%:

$*MACE* just touched 5 months bottom resistance point. In January after Capitol riots stock soared due to the whole industry (guns, ammo, self-defense) gains. I think that end of the month drop-off is due to people taking gains from speculation on January events.

Summary: I dont expect here SPAC or pharma level returns, but steady growth instead. Would like to see $*MACE* trade in $1.5-$2 by Q3 and consolidate there by the end of year. It also used to pay dividends, but that has stopped in 2011. Who know maybe good results will reward investors with some dividends? :)

My position: 3.3k shares at $0.412

Title: [GME] - Past Week in Review
Guys, I was a firm believer in the squeeze until I finished my DD last night. I hate to say it, but I think the jig is up and I'll show you my reasoning. In this document:

1. Melvin was telling the truth about covering their entire short position last week (.
2. Why the GME chart doesn't match the VW chart
3. If all the shorts have covered, then why are there no shares available to short?

# 1. Melvin Capital DID close their shorts last Monday

[Melvin Capital announced last Tuesday they closed their short positions](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/hedge-fund-targeted-by-reddit-board-melvin-capital-closed-out-of-gamestop-short-position-tuesday.html). There is more than enough evidence they accomplished this last Monday.

First, check out GME price action and volume last Monday (1/25). I want you to pay close attention to the period between 10am and 11am.

[GME price action and volume on 1\/25](https://preview.redd.it/vn98pna6p3f61.png?width=947&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73b9000a233bd0a522fa6d25c68ea4025bbecc92)

Now take a [Look at Melvin Capital's last reported holdings](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link). From what I can tell, it looks like Melvin liquidated a percentage of their positions across the board. I chose to sort this chart by % Ownership with the thinking that selling a stock for which you have high ownership is sort of a reverse squeeze (you create a large amount of float in comparison).

For their top owned holding (8.7% of shares owned)  **L Brands** (ticker LB), notice the price action on 1/25. They liquidated their holdings from \~10am-11am, which coincides directly with the jump in GME price.

[LB Brands price and volume action on 1\/25](https://preview.redd.it/e99gwq6io3f61.png?width=946&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e3b9f78b6892dfadf936a087398917f9d1865e0)

Furthermore, we can get a very rough estimate at how much Melvin raised to cover their GME shorts. From [Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/LB:NYSE) we can see LB volume on 1/25 was 17M shares. If we look across the previous 4 Mondays, the average volume on a Monday is &lt;3M shares. It's likely that when Melvin offloaded their shares, they caused stop losses to trigger and unintentionally caused others to sell their shares, but if we assume Melvin raised the cash from all the sales, they made \~$200M from LB sales alone.

Here's another holding (7.2% Ownership) American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) with the same price and volume action. The volume on 1/25 was 13M vs 3-5M for previous Mondays. Using the same napkin math as above, we get \~$200M netted above average volume.

Extrapolating this across their 119 holdings they could easily have raised the capital required to close at least most of their GME position. Although there is no data on their short position, assuming it was 10x their reported position in GME puts (50M), they could have easily covered the position in trading volume that day (178M)

[American Eagle Outfitters price and volume action for 1\/25](https://preview.redd.it/h75olhmgr3f61.png?width=944&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0390813919218e2cd528b6737df9bf576f00a22f)

Although I checked for quite a few of their holdings and saw the same pattern, I'm a retard when it comes to making these graphs and I'll leave it as an exercise to further validate.

# 2. Why isn't GME going to rebound like VW?

Most of you have likely seen the below graph used to describe the VW squeeze in 2008. One of the most notable parts about the graph is the massive drop in VW price right before the squeeze - why did that happen?

[Volkswagen AG share price during 2008 short squeeze](https://preview.redd.it/kgnshh3os3f61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdfcad33bff94490b2b0301e13befa602b854673)

[This is a great article I found gives a mostly objective view on the VW short squeeze](https://www.ft.com/content/0a58b63a-4294-3e07-8390-c3aabef39a26) and I think /u/notasabretooth gives a good explanation [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l624yc/why_did_vw_dip_before_the_big_squeeze_in_08/gkxu360?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) The great financial crisis crashed markets globally and VW followed suite - in fact, when VW stock began to fall, short sellers doubled down on their bets as VW was not in great financial shape which caused the very noticeable down spike in the graph above. Porsche had other plans, however, and announced to the world that it had stealthily accumulated shares and now \~90% of VW stock was out of circulation. This caused the sharp uptick and I would point out that there are no further rebounds following the initial squeeze.

Although GME still has many shorts, many of these shorts are likely not the ones that started before the squeeze and instead sold near the top with a much better cost basis. In fact, one of my subscribed newsletters sent out the below sage advice 4 days ago - and if I was smarter I would have listened :)

&gt;"GME is one of the greatest shorts of all time. If you can get the borrow short it he told me. "

# 3. If all the major shorts have covered, then why are there no shares available to short?

This was another thing that had not been sitting well with me. If there are no shares available to short sell, then how has the number of shorts decreased? 

First, touching on above - the current short sellers likely have a much higher cost basis and are unlikely to be squeezed like those caught in the initial squeeze. 

Second, it's not clear how shares are made available for borrowing. I found [this very informative article](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investor-education/can-my-broker-lend-out-my-shares-to-short-sellers-without-asking/article32393872/) which gives the meaningful lines of text

&gt;If you want to short sell a stock, your broker needs to call his or her firm's loan desk to see if the shares are available for lending... If the firm does not own it in their own portfolio they have to attempt to borrow the stock from other firms.  As a client of a firm, **your shares cannot be lent out to someone who is looking to short sell**. Shares are held in trust for each client and are kept on separate books. 

If this is true, then the GME squeeze was likely a victim of its own success. By retail investors buying all the stocks, we prevented a continuous short squeeze by evaporating the supply of shortable shares.

Title: TTCF Long and Potential Earnings Play
I came across an article about BYND where the author suggested that TTCF (Tattooed Chef)  is a competitor to BYND. Now I may be a smooth-brained autist but it seems that TTCF is actually quite different from BYND and has a niche in that it offers other popular food shit like stuff with cauliflower flour substitutes as well as plant-based meat. Also, in case you didnt know, Beyond Meats ingredients lists are longer than your wifes boyfriends dick, and health-conscious people dont like that. TTCF pushes a more farm to table notion that makes its products seem closer to the source, so it also differentiates itself from BYND that way. 

Last quarter's net income was shitty compared to previous quarters (loss of 3.1M for Sept 2020 compared to 916K and 4.88M for June and March 2020 respectively). They said that the major loss last quarter was due to a non-recurring expense, which is not unexpected considering these plant-based companies have a lot of innovative shit to deal with in order to scale and preserve food made from natural ingredients that naturally go bad. 

Another major thing to consider is their revenue last quarter compared to BYND: DESPITE THE FACT THAT TTCF HAS NEARLY 1/10 THE MARKET CAP OF BYND (1.65B compared to \~11B ), ITS REVENUE LAST QUARTER WAS ONLY  THAT OF BYND (41M compared to 94.44M). 

Also, given that unlike BYND the big institutions havent jumped on board for this one yet, there is solid room for growth. Their earnings will be at the end of the month or at the very beginning of March. The last earnings report moved the price up big time despite net loss and this upcoming one likely will too. 

I have a long position as well as 3/19 $30c and  3/19 $25c.

Title: CRSR Earnings Next Week, Could Mean 
First things first, I'm not a Melvin or Citadel bot trying to divert your attention from the squeeze play. I've posted on here a couple times before, I'm just interested in continuing to exchange quality plays to keep our tendies flowing. If you have any doubts, check out my last DD on $SRNE from a few weeks ago:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky63a8/srne\_to\_the\_moon\_again/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky63a8/srne_to_the_moon_again/)

Now, I know everyone is kinda busy right now with GME, AMC, BB, and the rest. However, if you do happen to be out of those names (or missed the ride and never got in), I have another stock that I would like to bring to your collective attention. Corsair Gaming (CRSR).

I've seen DD about this stock on here before, but it's been a little while and I feel like it deserves some more hype. For those who are not familiar, Corsair makes keyboards, headsets, and other peripherals for use in PC gaming and livestreaming, which is a rapidly growing market, especially in the wake of COVID-19 lockdowns.

Corsair IPO'd back in September, and they crushed their Q3 earnings report. Their quarterly revenue increased 60% year-over-year, and their net income was up **384%.**  They also released full-year guidance, and they expect to finish the year with $1.6B in revenue and $187M in EBITDA. These are huge numbers when you consider their market cap is only $3.4B! At this revenue level, they would only be trading 2X sales, which is not high at all considering the current market and the high-growth industry they operate in. It's also possible that they see a revenue boost due to the recent console cycle. This brought increased attention to gaming equipment, and generated a demand that other major players couldn't keep up with. If you wanted to buy the new PS5 at any point since it was released in November, odds are that you couldn't. I don't really have any data to back this point up, but in my personal opinion, that factor could have lead more people to invest in computer gaming in order to play the new next-gen games that were released with the new consoles.

Holiday shopping season + console cycle + low supply of competing hardware could equal a blowout quarterly report.

After the recent events with GameStop, I am surprised that this stock isn't getting more hype because its situation should be right up this sub's alley. Corsair has about 90 million shares outstanding, but most of those are owned by company insiders until the lockup period expires at the end of this month. Right now, the float is only 25 million shares, and half of that float is owned by institutions and another 2 million of those shares are sold short.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crsr/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crsr/institutional-holdings)

In other words, there are only about 10-15M shares available to freely trade on a daily basis. This low float means that this stock can be easily manipulated by the big players, but this scarcity also means that in the event of good news, this stock could fly. Even if enough people try to pile in before earnings, the price could jump $5-$10 like it did last Wednesday. 

Corsair is going to report their Q4 earnings on February 9th, and I think that leading into that report, they could move back into the $40 range. After their last earnings they ran from $21-$51, so another move over $50 is not out of the question. I still haven't figured out options, so I have no idea what strike price or expiration date you should be looking at, if any. I'm playing this the only way I know how, accumulating some shares while it's under $40 and holding 'till next week.

TLDR: High-growth gaming stock could crush earnings next Tuesday. Low float = high volatility, so any good news could shoot it up.

This is **NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**, please do your own research before entering into a trade. Simply presenting a trade that Im excited about, and Id love some feedback.

Positions: I don't understand options, 250 shares @ 38.60

Obligatory  for good luck

Title: Addressing GME FUD &amp; current situation
Fellow Mashed Potato Brains,

First  Monke Diamond Hands Banana Rocket Rocket Rocket Rocket Moon

**This is not financial advice. This is speculation based on my limited understanding of SEC rules and documents. Sources linked. Please read edits.**

**TLDR**: **My opinion** is that Shorts will continue to drive the price down with ladders and try to break the chain of consecutive days where GME is listed as a threshold security. ~~They need at least 1 non-Failure To Deliver day before EoD Thursday.~~ **If** ~~they~~ **an individual short gets even 1 day without** **~~aggregate~~** **Failure To Deliver then the entire 13 consecutive day count restarts \*for that short.** ~~They~~ **The shorts as a whole need 5 consecutive days without aggregate Failure To Deliver to have GME fully removed as a threshold security. Selling is good for them and bad for diamond hands. Ape strong together. Diamond Hands get the Rocket Ship.** **No idea if achieving 13 consecutive days will force the squeeze or not.**

&amp;#x200B;

**My opinion** is that Shorts dont plan to cover their position by Tuesday. They dont have to. Instead, they will drive the price down for as many days as possible and attempt to break the chain of consecutive settlement (read: business) days where they fail to deliver. GME has been listed as a **threshold security** (see below) for ~~10~~   \*37 consecutive business days (please check my math. I had to count on my fingers). \*Individual Shorts (not the short collective as a whole) need to break their chain of failure to deliver on that threshold security before it reaches **13 consecutive business days**. Participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in threshold securities if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days. \[SEC Rule 204\] (link below)

**If diamond handed monke can HOLD strong and reach 13 consecutive days \*of failure to deliver\* as a threshold security, then the shorts** ~~will~~ **(in theory) should have to cover the positions by buying GME shares or equivalent shares of like kind and quantity.** ~~If maths good, that puts Thursday Feb 4th as day #13.~~ **Ape hold strong.**

**\*\*Edit 5: Math not good. Jan 18th was holiday. We are at 37 consecutive days. Edit 3 &amp; 6 at bottom for more details.**

&amp;#x200B;

We've seen confusion, fear, uncertainty, and doubt surrounding what happened Monday Feb 1st. Remember that FUD is one of their greatest weapons against retail investors right now. They want to use it to divide retail and to convince people to sell based on emotion. IM NOT FUCKING SELLING!

**Warning: I am not a financial professional or a financial advisor. I read at a grade-3 level. This is not financial advice.**

\- Read below here if you can or care.

1. Why no squeeze Monday after $320+ close on Friday?

Shorts werent required to cover their positions on Monday. I think that they have T+2 (time of close + 2 business days) to cover their position. If true, this means they have until EoD Tuesday to cover. After that, they will have failed to deliver on the security. That isnt good for them, but it isnt as bad as it sounds. Failure to deliver is like a steppingstone in the process. After 5 consecutive business days with \*aggregate Failure To Deliver, the stock is listed as a threshold security. NYSE Threshold Securities can be checked here [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

It takes 13 consecutive days being listed as a threshold security before the positions must be closed **(If the rules still apply to them)**. \*I believe this is individual short positions that must be closed not all the shorts as a whole.\*

So, instead of covering, shorts spent the day driving the price down to a more favorable position for them. They may have scared away some paper hands along the way too.

2. How does that help the shorts?

Lower price means it costs less to cover and the Shorts have more room to negotiate with other funds. A cheaper darkpool buyout is good for them. If they can lower it enough, covering becomes a non-issue compared to a full on squeeze.

Shorts want to avoid days where GME fails to deliver and they want to create non-Failure To Deliver days to break the chain of consecutive failures to deliver. This is easier for them if the price is lower.

3. So squeeze on Tuesday/Wednesday right?

I dont think the squeeze happens Tuesday or Wednesday. I think the shorts are setting up the next part of their plan. I think if the squeeze happens this week, it happens because the shorts reach 13 consecutive days where they fail to deliver. This means diamond hands and limiting the number of cheap shares that shorts can buy after ladder attacks aka diamond hands.

4. Weve heard this before. So what?

I agree with the idea that adding RC &amp; friends to the board had a positive influence on the stock price. I dont think that was the only thing happening when we saw price rise during mid-January. Going back to the idea of 13 consecutive days as a threshold security, we can refer to our NYSE tracker [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

~~Starting at the beginning of the year, we see that Jan 4th is the first day GME is marked as a threshold security~~.&lt;- True but it was already listed as a threshold security starting Dec. 8th. It stays listed as a threshold security through Jan 15th. Remember we dont count weekends so the count resumes  January 19th (18th was a holiday) ~~January 18th. On the 18th, it falls off the list for the day and comes back on January 19th.~~ ~~Without this single day drop-off, the 13-day countdown would have ended at EoD Wednesday Jan 20th.~~ I believe that the price jump we saw can be partially attributed to the fact that \*some of\* the shorts NEEDED to avoid another Failure To Deliver or they would risk being uncovered. That was pre-spike. Now ~~they~~ some shorts are in a similar position closing in on \*their own\* 13th consecutive day. They will do whatever they can to avoid that 13th consecutive day because that means they will avoid having their record books searched through by someone outside their firm/fund.se

**Threshold Securities**

Def: Threshold Securities are equity securities that have an aggregate fail to deliver position for

 Five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency; and

 Totaling 10,000 shares or more; and

 Equal to at least 0.5% of the issuers total shares outstanding.

Edit 2: It has been brought to my attention that I didn't count Jan. 18th as a holiday when checking the threshold securities list. Going back to check my work now and will mark any edits that are made. Information will not be removed, but I will do my best to address any mistakes I have made. Thank you for your help.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 3: Dec. 25th, Jan. 1st, and Jan 18th were all holidays and NYSE was closed. Going back we see Dec. 8th has GME listed as a threshold security. It was correctly pointed out ( u/AlexGu812 ) that this brings us to 37 consecutive days. I don't know enough about this stuff to confidently say what that means. I think it may have to do with the close-out requirements or it could be a sign of bad faith actions.   "The requirement to close out fail to deliver positions in threshold securities that remain for thirteen consecutive settlement days does not apply to any positions that were established prior to the security becoming a threshold security" &lt;-- This may explain why we haven't seen mass closeouts despite passing the 13 day threshold.

Edit 6:  The 37 consecutive days are the shit splatters on an otherwise decent toilet. Let's try to clean it up without automatically assuming foul play. This is a thought exercise, **but I do not know if it holds true in the real world.**

In the post, I refer to "The Shorts" as a collective, but that's incorrect to assume. Not all shorts are making the same decisions or acting at the same day/time. We know that Failure to Deliver is measured as an aggregate, which is a net balance. If delivered are (+) and failed are (-) then we can figure out if a security failed to deliver by seeing if the net total is positive or negative (my understanding is that as retail we get the data as it becomes available rather than being able to measure it ourselves in real time). Within that net total, some actors will deliver their shares and some will fail to deliver. **Just because a security fails to deliver on the day doesn't mean every actor has failed to deliver. It just means the aggregate is net negative (for this example).** If this line of thinking is correct, it is possible that no individual actor has failed to deliver a threshold security for 13 consecutive days.

**Again, edit 6 is a thought exercise. Additional input, comments, criticism, and other lines of thinking are welcome.**

Title: Aphria/Tilray Merger Arbitrage Opportunity, Plus APHA vs. CGC
Well my fellow degens, I have an interesting one for you. Aphria (**$APHA**) and Tilray (**$TLRY**) are merging to create the worlds biggest cannabis company. Close to 1B (874M to be exact) in annualized revenues which will only grow.

Anyways the merger states:

Under the terms of the Arrangement, the shareholders of Aphria (the Aphria Shareholders) **will receive 0.8381 shares (the Exchange Ratio) of Tilray for each Aphria common share** (each, an Aphria Share), while holders of Tilray shares (the Tilray Stockholders) will continue to hold their Tilray shares (the Tilray Shares) with no adjustment to their holdings. Upon the completion of the Arrangement, Aphria Shareholders will own approximately 62 percent of the outstanding Tilray Shares. [Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201216005519/en/Aphria-and-Tilray-Combine-to-Create-Largest-Global-Cannabis-Company-With-Pro-Forma-Revenue-of-C874-Million-US685-Million)

This means Aphria should be trading at **.8381** of Tilrays share price. Tilray is at $22.50 x .8381 = **$18.86**. Aphria should be trading at **$18.86**, yet its only at **$13.95.** Thats a whopping **34%** difference.

Considering Aphria is the stronger company and controls 62% of the combined company, its very rare for it to be trading so far away from the merger ratio. Ive never seen a merger discrepancy like this before. If anything, Aphria should have the premium. Also, Tilray has high short interest so I doubt it will dip as shorts have to cover, it's most likely Aphria should catch up to Tilray's level.

**Aphria/Tilray vs. CGC**

Now lets compare Aphria/Tilray to Canopy Growth. Canopy did 135M revenue last quarter which is approximately 540M annualized revenue along with a 96M net loss and a whopping adj. EBITDA loss of negative 85M. Furthermore, Canopy has -190M free cash flow, ([Source](https://www.canopygrowth.com/investors/news-releases/canopy-growth-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-2021-financial-results/))

Aphria did 160.5M revenue with Adj EBITDA of 12.6M. This will only increase as their next financials will have SweetWater Brewing on them. [Source](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/aphria-inc-announces-record-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2021-results-890905217.html)

Aphria expected to potentially be cash flow positive either this Q or next. And we continue to work to be free cash flow positive in Q3, all subject to the intensity of COVID-19 restrictions in the markets where we operate. 

Canopy is valued at **15.8B USD**. Aphria/Tilray will be close to 1B annualized revenue, is EBITDA positive, and is valued at only 4.4 and 2.9B respectively. Not necessarily hating on CGC, the backing from Constellation is definitely solid, but when comparing the two Aphria should be valued higher.

Aphria leads Canada in market share ahead of CGC:  [Source](https://twitter.com/itsdgc/status/1356604397267124235)

Aphria also has a solid presence in the United States thanks to their EBITDA positive craft beer company, SweetWater who sells [cannabis-inspired beer](https://www.sweetwaterbrew.com/brews/420-strain-g13-ipa/).

Lastly, the U.S gov could act on some sort of cannabis legislature soon:

**TL;DR:** Aphria should be trading 34**% higher** than its current SP due to the .8381 merger ratio with Tilray.

If you are interested in cannabis, I believe there is much better value in Aphria/Tilray compared to CGC.

Title: Weedmaps, is the future Shopify of cannabis and potential multibagger
[DD](https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/investors-sign-weed-maps-cannabis-164032943.html)

(Read the article for more, I'm too lazy)
With the Democratic sweep, impending national cannabis legalization turbocharges this already sexy investment. More legal states = more cannabis retailers to list on Weedmaps = more revenue. Even better? I see a future where consumers buy their cannabis from local retailers in their state online via Weedmaps. The company is already profitable and has high brand equity with those who smoke the ganja. I posted about this SPAC around two months ago at $14 and it has since reached a peak of $26. At $20 where it currently stands, this a great time to jump in before the merge/ticker switches to $WEED. I see this stock reaching $50 before this Summer. Can't buy options, so I'm long 2,000 shares or you can buy the warrants.

Title: IFF - Update - Great short Squeeze opportunity.
Hey you guys - Sloth

Just wanted to give you an update on the IFF Short and gamma squeeze opportunity I brought to WSB yesterday.

It is great news! The cost to borrow shares continues  rocket upwards (44.7%), and they continue to use borrowed shares to try and keep down the price.

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/IFF

There is a good options ladder this week (at $135 and $150), and there is a monstrous option gamma squeeze at $150 for Feb 19.

This is also a very valuable company, which will see significant growth in their price to sales multiple, now that their acquisition of DuPont Nutrition &amp; Biosciences is complete.

Here is the Ortex data, showing the current number of borrowed (short) shares is at 61m:

Title: Understanding Short Interest: The most important post you will downvote all day.
# Short-interest ratio is:

* the number of shares sold short (short interest) divided by average daily volume.
* This is often called the "days-to-cover ratio" because it determines, based on the stock's average trading volume, how many days it will take short sellers to cover their positions **IF THE PRICE GOES UP**

# EILI5

* a stock has a short interest of 4 shares
* average daily volume of shares traded is 20
* 20/4 = 5 this would mean 5 days to cover

&amp;#x200B;

# What is Short Selling?

&amp;#x200B;

* Short selling is the opposite of buying stocks.
* It's the selling of a security that the seller does not own, done in the hope that the price will fall.
* You can borrow the stock from your broker-dealer, sell it and get the proceeds from the sale.
* **If the stock price declines, you can close out the position by buying the stock on the open market at the lower price and returning the stock to your broker. Since you paid less for the stock you returned to the broker than you received selling the originally borrowed stock, yourealize a gain.**

# ^ Bingo

What was the price of $GME last week? It was over $200, over $300, over $400 even...What is the price of $GME now ? $117 and as low as $74.

# If I opened a short position at $300, and closed it out at $74.22 the very bottom of the day.....maybe the price goes up a bit because lots of shorts closed for a profit....and sold to all of you who thought you were "buying the dip"

Based on Reddit Logic, it's impossible for any other person or company to have shorted the stock after it went above $200. Of course they did, that is an absolutely ridiculous price. Everyone knows what happens AFTER a short squeeze...look at the VW chart. It's easy to understand that a $300 price of GME wouldn't last that long, so if you short it at $300...why would you close your positions now when it will continue to drop? More it drops more you make.   


You all keep going back to the thought that Melvin who shorted at 4, 5, 10 dollars a share...has not covered. What do you think happened when the stock went up 400% last week????

Title: Checkmate wall street! 
**TLDR; Checkmate to the hedge funds**

Alright retards, listen up. Move your shares from your broker to direct registration. This puts the stock in YOUR name and not your brokerage (this is the electronic equivalent of a physical stock certificate).  
Meaning it will FORCE them to secure a REAL share. If our theories about the ladder attacks and naked shorts are true (significant counterfeit shares), the 
hedge funds will have a DEFINITE date that they will no longer be able to cover (3-21 days depending on how / when enough shares get moved over), even with the bullshit tricks up their sleeve. And when that happens.... fuck the moon, we're going to a new fucking dimension!

Someone tell me I'm wrong. Until then, fucking **HOLD**. 


**How to move your shares:**

It should be as simple as phoning up your brokerage and having them move the shares to DRS. They will have all the info needed as long as your account is up to date.

After that, you simply need to sign up with the registered transfer agent for GME, which is found here: https://news.gamestop.com/shareholder-services/investor-faqs

I contacted both Fidelity and the transfer agent (https://www-us.computershare.com/Investor/#Contact/Enquiry) and verified all of this. The transfer agent will offer the same trading services as a brokerage,
except they aren't pooling our shares together and you have COMPLETE control over how your share is used. This account would be only for GME. 


In reality once the % of float was moved over we'd start seeing the effects. I'm sure someone better at math than me could figure out the exact % needed.

Am retard. Not fin adviser. Additional DD on this subject in my profile.

Edit: 

More info on DRS "DRS provides investors with an alternative to holding their securities in certificate or street form. Under DRS, investors can elect to have their securities registered directly on the issuers records in book-entry form. With DRS, the investor does not receive a physical certificate, instead receiving periodic account statements (at least yearly) from the transfer agent or issuer evidencing holdings. Dividend/interest payments, proxy materials, annual reports, etc., are mailed from the issuer or its transfer agent directly to the investor."


Edit 2:

Big sad my fellow retards. While this plan would technically work (even somewhat validated by the fidelity equity rep I spoke with, he said they'd have to "locate the shares" first), I no longer think it is cost effective. The fidelity website page I saw for DRS transfers had them listed as free, but upon talking in more specific details with fidelity it would cost $100 PER SHARE to transfer. You literally cannot convince me that the system is not entirely rigged against the retail investor - we can't even truly own our fucking shares. I expect other brokerages are probably similar. I suppose one could do a free ACAT transfer to a cheaper broker, then DFS transfer from there but to do that in enough volume seems impossible.

Title: ICLN: Whats behind the $10M options play
[deleted]

Title: Dont buy Silver. Stay with GME.
Alright fellow Monkeys listen here. I found a great quote on [nasdaq.com](https://nasdaq.com) that summarizes how fucked the shorts are going to be.

"Heres An Example Of How To Short A Stock

For example, lets say ABC stock is currently trading at $10. After doing your research and due diligence (DD) you think that ABC stock could fall to $5 a share. You will then contact your broker, and your broker will lend you shares of ABC stock that you will then sell in the open market. In this example, lets say you short 10 shares of stock.

So, after selling those 10 borrowed shares of stock, you now have net positive $100 cash in your account. Next, ABC stock drops to $5 a share the following week. You will then do whats called cover your short position by buying the stock back. In this case, you buy back at $5. Lastly, you will pay your lender back the shares you borrowed and profit the difference. So with 10 shares as the example, you, as the investor, would profit $50 shorting ABC stock from $10 to $5 a share.

Its crucial to note that, despite some investors having made their fortunes by short selling, its considered a high-risk investment strategy. The reason being is because short selling has infinite risk. In simpler terms, the amount you can lose by shorting a stock is unlimited."

What we are seeing today is the HFs trying lower the price of GME in order to scare retail investors. They squeeze has not been squoze.

(insert a lot of rocket emojis, diamond hands and all that.)

I am a degenerate and this is no investment advice. Do your own DD and don't spam me. I increased my GME position today at 80$. But what do I know? I just buy GME and today it was cheeper than yesterday.

EDIT 1: If you want to check my source feel free! According to [nasdaq.com](https://nasdaq.com) the two most shorted stocks to watch are #1 GME and #2 AMC.

EDIT #1: just bought 50 more shares cause you retards got me fucking juiced 

Title: All "WSB stocks" are being treated the same by the media. They're not the same.
The media has been covering WSB absolutely atrociously. WSB stocks have been rising and falling together for days now, even though they are very different stocks that people are in for very different reasons. This has the potential to create some bargains. I wanted to do a quick rundown for those who are unclear on why. The stocks I'm going to cover are GME, AMC, BB, NOK, and I'll touch on SLV (and why it's not a WSB stock)

**GME: The squeezening**

GME was trading at $4 a share 6 months ago. People on Wall Street were treating it like it would be the next Blockbuster. The fear was the people would buy their video games online and make the company obsolete. Hedge funds started heavily shorting it, expecting it to go bankrupt within a few years. Even if it was, 138% short interest is insane. They were asking for a squeeze. 

Also Gamestop is not that much worse positioned than any other brick and mortar retailer. The pandemic cost them in the short term, but they can survive. Is Macy's going out of business because of online shopping? Maybe eventually, but for now they're trudging along. Gamestop even has some advantages over other retailers, in that they can buy used games for pennies on the dollar and resell them for dimes on the dollar. If you do that with clothes you're a goodwill. In other words: **we like the stock**

There was really good news concerning vaccination, so the pandemic sell-off started reversing. As the stock price came back to pre-pandemic levels, Ryan Cohen joined the board (previous CEO of Chewy) there was hope for the future trajectory of the company. This absolutely screwed the short sellers, leading to the short squeeze. Gamestop has become a short squeeze play. It's speculative right now. It won't be worth $500 a year from now, and no one believes that. But it also won't be worth $4 a year from now. 

**AMC: GME's little brother**

AMC has a similar story to GME, except less hope. The cinema industry has been decimated by the pandemic, but that doesn't mean that the company is closing imminently. The company became undervalued, and with hope that the pandemic was coming to a close, the price started coming back to pre-pandemic levels. Short sellers got caught with their pants down. They got squoze, and lost a ton of money.

AMC is different that GME in that cinema's were having huge problems even before the pandemic. Also unlike GME, there is no e-business guru joining AMC's board. I think GME has hope long term, whereas I am much more skeptical for AMC. The short squeeze means that the stock will have crazy volatility in the short term, but long term I'm not sure where it ends up.

**BB: Not GME**

Blackberry is known for making cell phones for boomers, but they have shifted dramatically. At this point, Blackberry is a cybersecurity company:

https://marker.medium.com/how-blackberry-yes-that-blackberry-became-a-cybersecurity-company-efae02912751

BB is also interesting because they are really involved in the cybersecurity of self driving car technology:

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackberry-software/blackberry-launches-cybersecurity-software-for-self-driving-cars-idUSKBN1F42LX

And with the solar winds hack, they were listed as a possible beneficiary. 

Blackberry has a partnership with Amazon, and has partnerships in China as well. BB is nothing like GME or AMC. It's a medium risk high reward stock that could hit $100 within 5 years or could do nothing. 

**NOK: Definitely not GME**

NOK is similar to BB in that people think of them for their phones, but they... don't do that anymore. NOK is a 5G company now. They have 2 major competitors in Europe, Ericsson and Huawei. Yes, that Huawei. The one that no one trusts because they are probably selling your data to China. It is likely that Huawei gets regulated out of Europe, which is a gift to Nokia. The company has partnerships with T-Mobile and Google:

https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/nokia-nok-secures-key-deals-145002461.html

Nokia is a low risk medium reward type of stock. It's trading at around $4.50 right now. I would be surprised if it didn't hit $5.50 by EOY. But I would be just as surprised if it hit $9. They look to be giving out a consistent dividend, which might bring some big pension accounts on board. 

**SLV: Not a WSB stock**

I think I saw 1 post on SLV here, and suddenly it is a WSB stock in the media. Someone posts here about SLV every once in a while, talking about silver to gold ratios or some shit. SLV is a scam. SLV does not create value. It's a commodity. Institutional investors are all over it. There's no law that says it has to have some ratio to gold. Literally the first law of the stock market is that past performance does not determine future results. 

Notice how SLV is the only stock out of all the "WSB stocks" that is not trending together. GME, BB, NOK, and AMC are wedded to each other even though they are obviously very different. SLV does it's own shit. I really think this SLV thing was just a way for some hedge fund to cover some sneaking shit they were pulling.

**ALL THAT SAID**

If GME or AMC crashes after the squeeze and that leads all the other "WSB stocks" to crash, BB and NOK present huge opportunities. I personally am going all in on NOK if it goes under $4 a share. 

**TL;DR**: GME and AMC are short term, high risk, high reward short squeeze plays. BB is a longer term, medium risk, high reward play. NOK is a longer term, low risk, medium reward play. FUCK SLV.

Title: GME valuation
This is not financial advice (maybe we need to change some laws if we have to always write these disclosures)

Im a former financial adviser that left the business back in 2012 because I was tired of the manipulation by large institutions. The game is rigged but understand the game if you are going to play.

What is GME worth- for all of you that like the stock. I think what you are saying is that you like video games, and the culture around gaming, and you want to support is a company that promotes those ideas. I can fully get behind that. And I can hope the GME management took the run up in stock price as an opportunity to bring some of your new capital in, and continue to restructure and develop a really amazing company around the future of gaming.

At some point though the price of GME stopped being about GME fundamentals or even a restructured growth story and started to be about a short squeeze. A very valid reason to buy the stock. Watching this all play out I noticed there was a point that short interest stopped going down. Institutions are sharks and will sell their grandmothers for a few dollars but many belong to larger entities that are not about to let a small trading arm take down their whole company. When the shorts stopped covering it wasnt because they were continuing to hold onto their losing bet. But it was because they had already lost. The legal entities and their clearing houses holding these short positions were already theoretically bankrupt. It did not matter what the overnight borrowing costs to short the stock were and it didnt matter what the price went to if the entity was bankrupt at $300, it is not More bankrupt at $400. You can be right about bankrupting some Wall Street institutions but still lose money if you are paying more for your trade than you will ever get back. My theory on the trading range over the past week is that some long side institutions said it wasnt worth owning over a certain amount and were willing to buy at maybe $150 but wanted to sell at $300 (these numbers are theoretical). Bankruptcy payouts take a long time, and if your money is tied up waiting for a bankruptcy judge to approve who gets what money... well that can take years. Not ideal for portfolio returns.    Summed up there is some value that can be extracted from the shorts but that dollar amount is not infinite. There is an upper bound on the short squeeze price.
Also, and this is more speculation, but the longer this goes on, the better Wall Street will be at extracting value out of the bankrupt institutions, and shifting more risk to the bankrupt entities- unwinding risk off of the other entities. If you are bankrupt, you dont borrow your last dollars from your credit card to put it on black at the roulette table, you put it on fucking 17 and hope the payout bails you out. And if you and your friend are both in financial trouble, you talk your friend who is already bankrupt into borrowing a few more dollars (because no one can save him anyway) and giving you that money so you can get out debt.

I bought some GME this morning because it felt like a good gamble and my guess is that there are still some value in the short entities

Edit - grammar

Title: How GME IS going to the moon(Yes, it's still possible) (Crucial pls read)
Obligatory:
First, non of this is financial advise&amp;I'm not a financial advisor
Secondly, I'm not sure if this fits in DD since this is more psychology so mods please correct the flair if I'm using the wrong one.

That being said:
I know y'all retarded apes don't want to read, but bear with me here. 
The current fact we all first need to acknowledge is that the price of GME has dropped significantly, and that the volume, albeit still low, is higher than yesterday to say the least. People have started to sell, and other where on Reddit people are starting to belief this thing is all over and we're a bunch of cultists.
Now the question I know y'all want to know: Is it over yet?
Short answer:Likely not, but it depends on us.
The very basis of the reason many of us believe GME with go to the moon in the first place, that it is HEAVILY shorted, *still holds true*. According to the volumes for the last few days, the restrictions still going on, and the media fake-silver hype, the HFs likely haven't covered their positions yet. Many of them likely even added new ones, as they believe the price is going to fall. The potential for going to the moon is always there, it never changed. What has changed, and can potentially truly wreck this spaceship, is our mentality. Due to the price drop, which, started with the HFs with their dirty tricks, people are starting to panic, and this panic, which is caused by a false manipulation, CAN wreck GME. People are less likely to buy in as they're afraid this is not ending well, and people are more inclined to sell due to the dropping and seeing all the other people selling.
*Spamming  will NOT stop people from selling or panicking. It only serves to make them think we're a cult*

*What to do*
What is important as of now, whether you're still in, already sold, or has been speculating the whole time thinking this is over and all these poor cultists are going to end up in shit. Is to understand, and not just blindly belief, that *the stock is still heavily shorted, and this fact NEVER changed*. If we all understand this fact we *win*. The only potential source of this failing is our doubt amongst ourselves. I urge everyone to take a deep breath, and ask yourself: *Do you really belief that the HFs are truly out?* If the answer is no, than the best thing we can do is to recollect ourselves, regain the faith(which should not be blind faith but faith backed by reason) we had in each other and in this stonk, and HOLD AND BUY. 

TLDR
*Our whole reason of doubt is our own doubt. The entire thing is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If we all believe we win we win, if we all believe we lose we lose.(Yes this includes you bystander, we are all in this together) The fundamental reason the we believed GME is going to the moon has NEVER changed. HAVE FAITH that is BASED ON REASON. Blind belief is NOT solid, and can only get you so far*.
The stock is at a low, and this is a great opportunity if you sold earlier to get back in again. If we come together and have faith in reason, we have a greater chance than EVER to send this to the moon, wreck Wall Street, whatever you're in this for at the beginning.
*Unity and belief in reason, not fear, makes us strong*
*GME TO THE MOON BUY AND HOLD*

To rebuild faith in reason: 
-Welcome discourse, don't call everyone a bot
-Actively engage in discussions and focus on the fact that the stock is still heavily shorted as ever
-Spam less emojis, more rational discourse, appear more collected so people don't think we're a bunch of crazy cults sinking with the ship

Title: Bullish signs on a seemingly tragic day, we're still in the game: price action DD
EDIT: forgot to add GME in the title. This is for the GME boyz

Just like last week, we are under a low-volume short ladder. And just like last week, bulls are hindered by brokerages' restrictions.

However, a remarkable thing happened today: GME tested a previous ATH/resistance ($76.76). GME first pulled back from that price point on Jan 21st, when the price opened at $42 and closed in the $60s. It was the first day ever trading was halted intraday, and our first massive win against hedge funds. $76.76 slapped us in the face and called us his bitch.

**So, why is today's price action bullish?**

Because when a stock tests previous ATHs and it **BOUNCES OFF OF THEM**, thus turning a resistance into a support, it's a sign that the stock is still healthy and has potential for an even more powerful run. **PLTR did that, NIO did that too in the past.** They went sky high (not as GME duh), tested previous ATHs, then kept flying to their own moon trips.

Now look at GME recovery.

And imagine how high it's going to fly again once brokerages let us monkeys out of our cages by lifting restrictions. Yes, GME could test the $500 resistance again after testing the $76.76 resistance now turned into support.

Guys, I don't have the vocabulary to explain how bullish this is in my opinion. I am blessed I can buy GME on my broker, looking forward for an amazing run through Q4.

**To GME newbies: this has always been a Q4 play. I was expecting the squeeze to happen after Q4 ER revealed what a powerhouse GME is, and I still do. Accumulate, hold, squeeze, cheer.**

DISCLAIMER: not financial advice. First bought GME in October, paper handed in late January, back in the game after seeing today's price action.

Title: WE SHALL RISE ONCE AGAIN. phoenix in fire, the stars shall be reaching for us.
 

Hey retards, I know confidence is down, with GameStop reaching all the way down to the $80s, and AMC hitting a dip. But it doesn't stop here. It will not stop. IT NEVER STOPS. The stock may fall, but again the stock can rise from the ashes like a bright red **phoenix** blazing with fire. We've come so far, must we give up our **hope**, our **dignity**, our **power** we so slowly but rightfully finally began to gain? Before reddit was just a social media platform; a joke platform where people could come to for a laugh. Now look at us. Making the big moneies cry, news outlets despiratly spreading rummors to test our strenght and try to rip us appart. They try to make us collapse, try to make us crash with fallen out teeth and broken bones. BUT WE DO NOT BREAK. WE DO NOT FALL. We are one, and together, we shall rise higher than a man could dream. Higher than the stars can reach. The stars, the stars shall reach for us.

Now take advantage of these dips while you still can, because prices are rising, and strength is gaining. We shall sore higher than any bird will ever fly. We are wallstreet.

The sun is beginning to rise over the battlefield and the hedgies will soon have to collect their dead and wounded and retreat back to their hidey holes from which they came. For those of you still holding stay strong! Even if they win a battle or two they will not win the war. 

    

Title: The hedgies are currently extremly fucked - here is why
Just ignoring that:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Tons of bots promoting anything other than GME.

\- Tons of news saying WSB was responsible for a surge in SLV and an apparent squeeze which will NEVER happen. Citadel holdst the 6th most shares in SLV.

\- Tons of TV-news reporting the same

\- The stock being sold way undervalue between hedge funds that have shorted the stock by over 110%.

\- Portraying us as lazy, greedy, irrational and Alt-right people promoting GME

&amp;#x200B;

**The price of all Citadel held stocks including GME and AMC are appearing as lower because much lower since the stocks are are getting pingponged between the hedgies for lower prices for the algorithm to make the stocks appear lower. a few hundred thousand stocks are being ping ponged for lower and lower prices between the firms**. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every day we hold and buy the dip the hedgies are getting even more fucked. They are extremly fucked. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The price you are seeing means absolutely nothing. Buy and hold - do not sell to buy in again low since we are getting restricted. Just hold**

211 bought just now at 97. and 200 spread out over 100 to 330.

Title: GME Pep Talk and Facts

36mil in volume is not a lot! These guys shorted around $5 so unless the stock hits $5 you're fine. Even then, you're fine if we don't sell. Don't be paper handed. Most retailers are still holding.

This is a once in a lifetime chance. Red is just a color, it will change if you hold and buy the dip. I plan on buying more near end of day myself!

**The short itself will probably happen after Thursday Feb. 4th.** This is because that would be the 13th consecutive day of Failure to Deliver on a threshold security. But this only happens if the shorts can't deliver the shares they owe. They're trying to illegally drive the price down so when they buy back they can avoid a squeeze. I'm a literal retard, but I have a feeling the price is gonna start going back up on Thursday or next week. Maybe someone can explain more

**Retail investors own over 100% of the actual shares. This means the price goes as high as we want it to go. It will keep climbing until we sell. They are using every trick in the book because they know they're f*cked! This is literally free money if we all hold. There is nothing they can do but try to scare you.**

I sold my meager 40 shares like a paper handed bitch a few days ago, but have seen the error of my ways and I've been buying back in. I'm going to buy over 40 shares this time to make up for it. HOOOOOLD.

Lastly, remember to remove your stop losses so you don't sell!

For SEC interns, this is not financial advice. Idk what I'm talking about. I like the stock. Ryan Cohen is great.

**EDIT:** [More on the whole 13 consecutive days bit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/layb2c/cutting_through_fud/)

**EDIT 2:** I am speculating on when the short squeeze will happen but I'm a retard. You hold this stock even if Feb 4th comes and goes. Truthfully, it could be weeks before the squeeze happens.

Title: SNM Analysis &amp; Predictions
I felt it was time for me to gather some thoughts about ShaMaran. Sometimes it feels like you are all alone with owning this stock. And it would be nice to have some discussion about the company, and to hear other investors' views on the stock and the company. Which, in my opinion, is not necessarily the same thing. The company is doing very well, but what about the share? Nothing!! Why?

It is very difficult for me to understand that we are still at these low levels!
When the oil price has recovered to over $50 and stands at $57/brent at the time of writing. We should get up to the levels we had at the end of 2019 and start in 2020!! To begin with

So only there is a nice rise for the stock!

Certainly the oil price was higher then between 60-65$ barrel. 
But then there was also uncertainty surrounding krg's payments, which were not paid between Nov-19 and Feb-20 of $41.7 million. Which we will probably soon see start being paid back. At least if we are to believe in Genel, GKP and Dana Gas who have notified the market of this.

Below I have gathered a few things that make me look bright on the future and that the stock feels interesting to own.


Refund from KGR

That we see  KRG begins repayment of the debt for delivered oil between Nov-19 and Feb-20 of 41.7 million dollars. If we get this money into the bank, it looks very good for the valuation and cash flow!

https://genelenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Genel-Resumption-of-override-payments-FINAL-11.12.20.pdf 

https://www.danagas.com/media/press-releases#sec-5986 

https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/gulf_keystone_petroleum/news/rns/story/w6qe47r  

Why doesn't SNM do the same? And why don't they answer the question of refunds and give feedback to the market when I ask them? Is this in Taqa or what is it that is taking so long? Here I see the closest trigger for the stock! So it's very frustrating that they don't communicate this course-driven information to the market! 

I think they can be much better at communicating to the market, what the stock needs are new buyers and higher turnover to attract interest from larger investors. Which is an absolute prerequisite for an higher valuation of the company. Here, the company management needs to become much more active in its actions regarding marketing the company. Why don't they do more to be seen?






Increase in Company Gross 2P Reserves

We should expect an update before February is over. There can certainly be positive surprises here. What is interesting is our reserves in relation to our production and what has been communicated around development plans for the field. I can't make up the math here. www.shamaranpetroleum.com/site/assets/files/5222/corporate_presentation_-_dec_2020.pdfPage 2 108.5 million barrels 2P/C It produces today according to page 4. An average of 46,300 barrels per day with an ambition to raise these significantly. To 80000-100000 a day!108 500 000 / 46300 = 2344 / 365 = 6.5 So in about 6.5 years, you're out of oil? No, I don't think so. More oil will be transferred to 2P/C but the question is how much and when it will happen? 

How much oil is there in Atrush? I believe in a lot of oil...



KRG and Baghdad
Will we finally see a solution between KRG and Baghdad on the budget? And what will it mean for IOCs operating in KRG if SOMO receives 250 bpd, will Baghdad see the contracts as legal? And how will investors view the companies operating in Kurdistan? Does some of the risk disappear? And the companies get a completely different valuation?

Sarsang and Total

Very exciting things are happening in the neighboring block, Sarsang, where Total is possibly on its way to sell its share of 18%. According to Bloomberg, Total believes it can get up to $ 500 million for its part. And if they get close to that price, that would be very positive, for the valuation of nearby Atrush! And who could be the buyer? I think that the Russian companies in particular is strengthening its presence in the area. But time will tell.

Plan for expansion

It will be very interesting to see if there are any decisions, about expanding the field to 80-100bopd. This was to be decided on, in 2020 but was put on hold when Covid-19 became a fact and the oil price crashed. But now it's time I think to make a decision on the issue regarding the future expansion of the field. 

Page 3. www.shamaranpetroleum.com/site/assets/files/5158/2019-12-snm-cp.pdf 

Here I see the greatest potential for an upgrade of the company. Here, future company value and future belief regarding Atrush's ability to be the company's basis for stability and sole asset are determined. I would like to see the use of cash flow to acquire new assets. And that the company can grow further with higher share prices as a result! 





Installation of Second Trainat Early Production Facility"

I think it is very interesting to look back at information that the company has given before. To create an image of where they are today or in the near future. If you look at the presentation from August. 

Page 8 www.shamaranpetroleum.com/site/assets/files/5196/corporate_presentation-shamaran-rev10.pdf 

So it will be very interesting regarding the opportunity to see an increase of production in the very near future. Wonder how far the company has come?

Installation of Second Trainat Early Production Facility. Second productiontrain (EPF.T2) brings current Atrush processing capacity in line with well capacity circa 58Mbopd. 

Is it already installed and they can easily screw up prod 10,000 barrels / day? There is a lot that justifies this, among other things, if you get the debt back from Nov-Feb faster. That calculation becomes much more appealing if you count on 55$ barrels/brent, which we are a bit over now at the time of writing, and a production of 58,000 barrels / day. I do not see it as completely unlikely that in the foreseeable future we will hear from the company that they will increase production to these levels. This is, after all, information from August and it is quite reasonable that we are there today.


Conditions for earning. As everyone knows, the price of oil is very important. And here I think we will see a surprisingly large re-inhibition of the prize in 2021. What happens to the oil price is always uncertain as it can change overnight both up and down. But there is much to suggest a strong recovery in demand. And this, at the same time as investment in the sector has been declining for several years. This could be a perfect storm for oil prices if supply cannot meet demand. Shamaran produces at a very low cost and here there is an incredible leverage with a higher oil price.
www.macrovoices.com/guest-content/list-guest-publications/4009-art-berman-macrovoices-jan-7-2021/file
And for every dollar that the oil price increases by, the higher the earnings for snm. Here I think the market will change attitudes towards oil stocks overall in line with a higher oil price.



The bond 

https://www.shamaranpetroleum.com/news/shamaran-proposal-to-bondholders-approved-122758/ 


We'll see what happens there. But I think we'll be surprised. With Lundin you can never know. "expect the unexpected" When i add up everything. ShaMaran has never looked more interesting. And had so many triggers for the stock lined up in the near future. Now there is only one direction for the stock and it is up.

Title: They're dumping shares onto the market, CONTINUE TO HOLD
While looking at the bids and asks on Gamestop I noticed that at the start a lot of ask's with a lot of shares were placed, those are probably by institutional investors. My theory is that they were dumping a lot of stocks onto the market to make it seem like the stock is plummeting. Just look at this bid with 30k shares:

&amp;#x200B;

[a lot of ask's with a \(relatively\) big volume at once ](https://preview.redd.it/8rrkvhr133f61.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21f0ed5ea7661f596f47ec077aaa851114c46611)

The good news is that it seems like they can't keep up with the volume since most of us are holding the stock, and because most retail investors already bought GME, it seems like the demand is going down.

&amp;#x200B;

[Here you can clearly see that the volume of stocks being dumped on the market is going down.](https://preview.redd.it/16dezk0l33f61.png?width=1450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a070b8551318b19742b7514028b569e50eeb5a4d)

So what does that mean for us? As long as we're not able to match the dumping of shares onto the market with enough demand the price will probably continue to go down, but that doesn't matter as long as we keep holding with our FUCKING DIAMOND HANDS !!

99% of you retards don't know what the fuck is going on. Buy this, no buy that,  no it dipped, sell, oh no it went up, I'm a retard. This is what I'm constantly seeing from all the new faces

A certain 5G stock #knockknock has been getting hype for a few weeks now and it has REASONABLY been ignored because we support our brothers fighting the good GME fight.

NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT

everyone keeps complaining about how high of a float this stock is. 

I GUARANTEE you that is not an issue. The publicity that this got this week was unprecedented. We bought so much that these fucks are restricting us from buying a leading 5g stock that has been around since 1865. My broker told me I had to cancel my sell order because it was stuck in citadels order book. What the FUCK does that mean? We are being suppressed for a reason. HEDGE FUNDS LIKE THE STOCK

And guess what motherfuckers!? I LIKE THE GOD DAMN STOCK TOO!

Price target $50+:

1. Most essential 5G patents in the world
2. Fastest 5G speeds recorded
3. Controls over 27% of the 4/5G market
4. First company contracted to set up internet on the moon (NASA)
5. Will receive MULTI-BILLION dollar settlements from ongoing litigations with Mercedes Benz and Lenovo
6. Technology provider and main collaborator of the National Security Center of Excellence 5G Cybersecurity Project (Federal 5G project)
7. Selected to be the main collaborator of the Hexa 6G European Union Project
8. Has pending Department of Defense contracts yet to awarded
9. Just sealed a contract with TMOBILE for US 5G roll out.
10. Has and will take market share from Huawei, already has secured multi-year deals with important Chinese companies
11. Blackrock increased their position to 333,000,000 shares during 2020, an increase of 21 million shares held from the year before (7% increase)
12. May also be getting back into the phone business as they are manufacturing phones in India
13. Vanguard Capital owns 160,000,000 shares and is continuously buying
14. Google Cloud announced a partnership with $NOK to Accelerate Cloud-Native 5G Readiness for Communications Providers

TLDR: 
$50+ price target
Buy #knockknock 
6k shares and growing


Title: Why GME and AMC holders need to be looking at on balance volume to have an idea of what's going on with these volume and price movements. A little helpful DD
**Newbies**, skip this paragraph. **Non-newbies** (and people who actually bothered to do 5 minutes of research about volume price movements), the **tl;dr** is that the gradient for OBV is not proportional to the gradient of the price decrease, indicating a bullish divergence. 

I got a few PMs about my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laww2w/legit_proud_of_all_of_you_for_not_selling_this/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) and what that little blue line called on balance volume, or OBV means. OBV basically gets a positive or negative value based on if the prices are going up, or going down at that time. So in theory, when price rises, OBV should rise at the same rate to that increase, and vice versa. 

However, the useful thing about OBV is in the name - it's weighted by volume. This means the more shares that are bought/sold, the steeper the OBV line (or gradient). So in this gamestop selling run, we would expect such a crazy price decrease to be followed by a similarly crazy decrease in on balance volume, since a lot of shares would not be in the hands of retail investors, theoretically. However, the OBV line has barely moved. What this means is that the price has decreased far below what most people are holding it for, comparing it to the first OBV rise last week when everyone bought into GME. This in turn means that the price is being changed by barely anything, and it really hangs in the balance of a few trades right now.

**But what are the statistics???**

In today's price drop we saw 5 million shares negatively impact OBV against a total balance of 1.1 billion, that's a factor of 0.5% and is microscopic compared to a daily increasing rate of 25% last week. That's why everyone here is going on about volume - there isn't any. If you're still confused, go on tradingview and bring up the on balance volume indicator, and look at the past 7 trading days.

Just trying to prevent y'all from panicking so much.

Title: Some Motivation for GME Spoken by WBS very own Mark Cuban. "If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do." - Mark Cuban
\*\*This keeps getting removed... hopefully it will stick.\*\*\*\*

From Today's AMA with Mark Cuban, READ THIS.

"If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.

Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.

I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.

I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street."

I see some WSB posts that are totally panicked. We need to remember why we are here in the first place. Do you want to see the Hedge funds win? NO! then HOLD THE LINE AND DON'T SELL!!!!  

 Spoken by a fellow autist, this is not financial advice, I just like this stock

Title: Volume chart patterns
Hello fellow apes. First post here. 

Listen up, I want to talk about the volume charts on GME along with everything were seeing right now to help you make the decision to be a  chad or paper handed b***. 

My thesis: GME to the moon, and the negative price movement were seeing right now is a non-fucking-issue. 

Some facts:
-RH restricted trading for GME past few days pushing price down synthetically 
-silver bots spamming WSB
-simultaneous coordinated media attacks to control the narrative telling us that retail has pivoted to silver
-Melvin down &gt;50% in JANUARY (oops)
-S3 data looks fishy 

So back to the volume charts. Oh shit GME is down whatever, it doesnt matter. Heres why Im confident that this is purposeful, possibly short ladder attacks. 

At open 1/28, 2/1 and 2/2 MASSIVE volume for those days both at open pushing the price down, which was followed by low volume. 

My interpretation: HFs trying to dispel hype and our faith by large volume selling at open (look at counterfeit stocks, cant find link) to depress price and kill momentum. 

Not financial advice, just my interpretation and why Im down 50% but dont fucking care. 

EDIT: Volume is WAY up since I originally posted, interpret that as you will.

Title: GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next
Hello all,

(written Monday so "tomorrow" = Tuesday 2nd")

If you don't recognize my name then perhaps you haven't seen my posts at the start of all this. You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

Things looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.

Now, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.

But what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.

Melvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.

One of two things can happen to these people:

1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able
2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.

This logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.

So what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.

Now, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**

If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?

Normally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.

If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.

Another question to consider:

If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.

The final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.

Now, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.

Now, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:

1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.
2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.

**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.

I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.

Copied off a greaT DD

**EDIT:** For people claiming the liquidity defense, please tell me why trading on TSLA was not blocked during its insane short squeeze. If that sounds aggressive I'm sorry, I'm truly trying to find an answer to this question.

**EDIT2:** This all speculation, no one knows what comes next, no one. We just do our best to guess.

Title: Some thoughts on SILVER, GME and game changing events with dragons and stuff
# Disclaimer:

I   am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I barely   understand how the stock market works. Professionally I'm a   computational researcher -- my job is to simulate complex systems that   my smooth brain barely understands.

Okay fellow retards,

loooong time lurker and europoor autist. So excuse my spelling. Lets brake some things down:

SILVER:

Its   a real well played scheme on this. You have to remember there is a   dragon in the east, where people have a historically deep bonding to   silver. And the dragon looooves to take a gamble. So, number one   priority for Melvin and hedge fund friends is to distract the dragon   from GME with shiny silver. Imagine HFs did not throatfuck GME on   Thursday and the dragon banged into the marked, heavy. This uprising of   the dragon is exactly what this autist observed by comments on wsb late   Wednesday, early Thursday. If HFs didnt screw the market exactly this   moment and pulled some silver shiny stuff out of their pockets, they   would have already been toast.

Besides   that, try to find silver shorts/put options for a reasonable   spread/price which are also available to buy. I tried the whole day   yesterday but at least at my europoor broker I couldnt find a single   one. What tells you that? Looks like **smart money is not buying the silver rush**.

&amp;#x200B;

ANTI GME  BOTS:

These guys are getting their **bots more and more angry and aggressive**   over the last 24h. But why would they still take the effort, if they  already hit their targets? All this shows to my retarded autist smooth   brain is that they are in deep fear! Hey, bot guys I just want to quote   one of your clients: What's your beef with me. I'm just trying to make  a  living just like you ...I hope you guys got payed in advance,  because  your clients will likely go out of business!

Anyways... just to repeat **the obvious: They try to create fear among you retards** and make your diamond hands become weak ass toilet paper!

To   close this part I just want to quote some famous investor from Omaha:   (Be) fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are   fearful. Im an autist, I dont feel fearful at all. I simply cant   But for some reason the bot guys are. They seem fearful as fuck to me.

&amp;#x200B;

SHORT INTEREST RATIOS:

So I hope most of you guys realized, they simply changed the formula to calculate **SI rates**. Its basically **still \~120%**.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read\_this\_they\_are\_screwed\_numbers\_dont\_lie/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/)

In science you would say they normalized the standardization:

You   take your observed value also into account and add it to your base   value. Eventually your maximum number can only be &lt;=1 or in other   terms &lt;=100%, In this specific case you take your number of shorted   stocks and add them to the float as a base value. Then you divide your   number of shorted stocks by the base value (including shorted stocks)   which can only be smaller then 1 or 100% in respective. ...inflate the   base to make things look completely different Anyways my smooth brain   is able to convert the equation to the old standard (shorts/float) which   is based on S3s latest 55% short interest rate (Just to make it easy  for your autist brains):

shorts/(shorts   + float) = 0.55  0.45/0.55 shorts = float  -&gt; 0.81 shorts = float     shorts = 1/0.81 float = 1.23 float or 123% of float.

[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448)

...in   addition you have to keep in mind, big players always have taken fines   and trials into consideration as costs. I dont know what the fines  for  misinformation regarding number of shorted stocks are, but if you  are  scared to death you should:

First   of all, not show it to your retarded smooth brained enemies by   recruiting bot armies, obviously lying, silver bullshit, other FUD,   ...you name it.

AND you are   willing to take any risk to survive. ...or fines   ...in this kind of   situation probably any kind of fines no matter what.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But  why would they do this? Whats their business with the Hfs? You ask  yourself? You guys are threatening soooo many business models in   finance. And this is the real **game changer**!

Keep   in mind: On stock markets you mainly trade the future. You have to  make  scenarios for the upcoming future. And there is a horrifying  scenario  for boomer financial services arising at the horizon. But  first lets  bring it to the crucial point first:

Look for **information asymmetries**,   google it or whatever Thats what its all about in the end. Thats   the main reason why big players make shit tons of money from small   players. Its all about information sovereignty. Or the information   monopoly however you call it. The one who is (quicker) capable to   gather more accurate information and hide it from others, wins. Like   buying your investment decisions and order limits from RobinHood.   Sometimes its even enough to convince your enemy that you are in   possession of better information. (By the way, this fight about   information sovereignty is exactly what you can observe right now. HFs   try to convince you retards that they have better and more accurate   information about the whole situation.)

So, lets come back to the bullet point:

Imagine   a huge crowd of people on social platforms gathering more and more   accurate information and take investment decisions on that. Because of   declining information asymmetries constantly draining money out of it.   This will drastically change the current state of the market in means of   clients to financial service provider relations. Making it a more   liberated, fairer market in some kind. ...the whole industry would lose   trillions in the future. So yeah, you guys did it. You scared a big   chunk of the whole financial sector.  Not with GME in particular but with this way of investing.   Therefore from the financial industries point of view this transition  process MUST be stopped and delayed at any cost. This is literally the  clusterfuck for boomer financial services! And the worldwide media and   wsb are the battlegrounds right now.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But   hey, Im just a short minded, stock loving retard, having a lot of fun  on this! GME to the moon! Planing to buy some dips today because Im  way  to autistic to feel anxious about ridiculous 100 stocks short  ladder  ping pong.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: GME, trillions, to the moon!

Title: FDA Approval Imminent for $BLUE
Hey All,

Following up with a 3rd DD after posting these gems last year: [$OZK](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j52m4n/bank_ozk_the_new_century_financial_of_the_current/) &amp;  [$FIT](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j9zayy/why_fitbit_will_trade_higher_than_735_acquisition/). Both were excellent disasters, so sorry to the degens who followed me down those holes. Nonetheless, I doubled down on my $OZK play because I still think they're shit. 

Moving on, I believe $BLUE is on the verge of FDA approval for one or both of it's key gene therapy drugs. The company currently has a beta thalassemia drug conditionally approved in the EU (Zynteglo), and has a sickle cell drug that's awaiting approval. Last year was rough for the company as it struggled to get approvals, while it continued to burn through cash on its cancer drug research.

The company will be splitting off the cancer division later this year into a separate company, so it can enable both new companies to focus better on their respective applications. As a result, $BLUE is trading below 50% of where it was a year ago, despite having two fully developed drugs in the pipeline.

On to the DD: $BLUE has just posted a role on its website for a VP of US Sales for Zynteglo and the Stem Cell drug [Career Site Link](https://boards.greenhouse.io/bluebirdbioinc/jobs/2291768). These roles are expensive and hard to fill in Boston, indicating that $BLUE feels like they'll need a US sales team soon.  

The Play: Jan 21 2022 Call, $85 strike. It's currently trading at $3.90 per contract. The option will pay out a 100% gain if $BLUE increases to $90 by December '21. Considering this stock reached a high of $230/share on successful trial news, an FDA approval will send this stock soaring. Obviously there's huge risk here, but $BLUE seems to think things are looking up based on their hiring.

TLDR: $BLUE is a pharma stock trading at a discount considering FDA approval may be imminent; they just posted job openings for a US sales VP.

Title: NOK Announces 10G rollout at 9AM. Its gonna be a hell of a ride today.

&amp;#x200B;

So we all know that NOK is a value play. This further puts NOK as leader in the tech right now. They already have a ton of contracts dealing with 5G. They are talking about 1T, but today announced 10G rollout as well. If that doesnt mean anything I dont know what does. The down play in the market today is because of its link in the BANG gang. Most of the other 3 have dropped, pulling it down as well. But dont let that fool you. Its a long play. IT IS IN NO WAY A SHORT PLAY... We really have to drill that into peoples heads. .... and for sake of my self.... I'm not a financial advisor... LOOK AT THE NEWS....

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Clarification- 10G is a fiber rollout. Its an infrastructure update. 1T is the [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/27/2164807/0/en/Nokia-and-Elisa-push-network-boundaries-with-world-s-first-1T-deployment.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/27/2164807/0/en/Nokia-and-Elisa-push-network-boundaries-with-world-s-first-1T-deployment.html) Network aspect.

Title: If you want to hurt the shorts, GME is no longer the best target
The key to hurting short sellers, and triggering a squeeze, is to turn their positions into the red. Only then will they maybe get margin called or trigger their risk protocols.

This depends crucially on the price they started shorting. For example, if a HF shorts 1000 shares of GME at $4, and it is now $100, they have $4000 cash and a short interest of $100,000, with a loss of $96,000. Meanwhile a hedge fund that shorted at $300 and the stock is now $100, is sitting on $300,000 cash, a $200,000 gain, and $100,000 short interest.

Unfortunately, according to Ihor/S3's data (giving him the benefit of the doubt), the current GME short interest is 8.8 billion on 27 million shares shorted. This means tens of millions of short sellers covered during the dips, and the new shorts probably came in in the 300s. For us to meaningfully hurt their books we would have to drive the share price to like $400-$600 \*without\* a short squeeze before a short squeeze happens. That takes a lot, specifically 10s of billions of dollars, so I don't see that happening soon, even with whales etc. on our side. Sadly, the broker shenanigans seem to have given them a chance to slip out.

(GME data: [https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356261806612885509](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356261806612885509) )

So now what? The best we can do is hold and wait for material events to happen related to the turnaround. As Ryan Cohen succeeds, we will have the winds behind our back to try this again in a few months.

In the meantime, consider these stocks instead: FUBO and BBBY. Both have decent businesses and high short interest at a reasonable price.

(short data: [https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1354847896173240322/photo/1](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1354847896173240322/photo/1) )

FUBO is a growing streaming platform that is great for live sports. It is growing and has a lot of wall street analyst support. It is heavily shorted at 67% of float, with the shorts in at at most $60. Wall street analysts have also recently set 50 price target, and the stock is at 50. FUBO is thus a great candidate to paint some HF books red.

BBBY is not as good of a target, but has a credible turnaround story like GME, and is currently sitting at $26 dollars, with the shorts in at at most $52. This could move with an order of magnitude less capital than GME before the shorts start seeing losses.

&amp;#x200B;

Happy hunting.

Title: About GME, I hope a Decent DD.
Fellows, greetings.

Right now this sub has become a fucking hell with all the shitpost hanging around. Didn't we have a Flair for that ? You lost 5 dollars ? Fuck off, stop crying, its WSB not your mommy's skirt. You want to sell when others are telling you to ? Fuck off, do your own research, its WSB not advising. You want to bring down other autists with you because you paper handed and you feel bad ? Fuck off, keep it to yourself and take whatever you got (either win of loss) like a fcking man already.

Now to your crayon eaters, here we go. I'll adress the major bullshits we see on here : Is the squeeze squoze ? And Why is it going down ?

# SQUEEZE SQUOZE NO NO

Actually it's pretty easy on this one. The short squeeze can happen because of the tremendous amount of shares being shorted, and to those of you saying "But ... but ... s3 said 50%, they covered and...." **FUCK YOU ALREADY. DO YOU EVEN RESEARCH?.** Here's a link with ACTUAL bloomberg terminal data : [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labst6/gme\_and\_amc\_short\_data\_taken\_from\_bloomberg/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labst6/gme_and_amc_short_data_taken_from_bloomberg/)See that 31.01.2021 with "Short" = 61M on GME ? Yeah ... exactly, not squoze yet. Oh and by the way, for the most retarded of you all, "**float% = 122%**" should ring a bell. The second they buy back the shares we see two things : 1/ Huge trading volume and 2/ Spike on share's price.

With low volume, the price also went DOWN significantly... so neither 1/ or 2/ have been done at the moment.

# But then what does it mean ?

Ok you saw it everywhere, **shord ladder attack** : [This comment here explains it quite quickly](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l72r36/what_is_a_short_ladder_attack/gl4dxee?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) so click on it and read the whole thread, or google it man... If you can't do research this is why the sub is going south.Why would they do this ? Shord ladder drives down the price, so HF can enter lower, make money on the way on top, then short on the top to make money on the way down, (If you think they are not playing both ways, you have nothing to look for here), scaring the paperhands of yours to sell on the way down, helping them get their head out of the water a little bit.

With the new arrival on this sub (Hello 5+ milions people), it has become really a hard moment finding decent answers to our questions and it has become WAY EASIER to concede to FUD because of all the shitposts going on. I'd like to ask this from you now  : Stop shitposting, post with up-to-date data and source (as much as you can), and if you can't, don't post. If you lost 100$, dont post, it's not loss porn and the sub is wallstreet B.E.T.S! If you come to cry for all losses, at least make them a million dollar one, or else stfu. I'm getting tired of the crybabies.

Title: Serious $TR DD: This Still Has Room to Run
Some people who missed out on the broader non-GME squeeze play might be hesitant to get involved with another one of the high short-interest names now that theyve run up 3-4x. But could you imagine that one of these short squeeze names not only has A LOT more room to squeeze (and hasnt been restricted by many brokerages), but is still a **value** play even after the massive run on shorts?

Thats what we have with TR.

Its been pointed out that TR is heavily shorted with 45% of its float short. But if youre looking for squeeze potential, you should be paying at least just as much attention to days short: if a name has limited liquidity, the shorts will have a hard time exiting their positions regardless of the nominal short interest.

Days short on GME was just 2 as of mid-January, and even at its peak reached no higher than 25 days way back in July. AMC is just 1 day short, and reached no higher than 7 in October.

TR? Its STILL 45 days short as of the same date.

**GME: 2 days. AMC: 1 day. TR: 45 days.** Thats higher squeeze risk by an order of magnitude going by that metric.

The shorts are 7.3m shares deep in their short positions on TR, but the stock typically trades only 125k shares per day, and it didnt pick up nearly as much volume as the other squeeze candidates like AMC and EXPR last week. **While AMC, EXPR, etc. are up 3-4x on the squeeze trade, TR is up only 33%. But if TR even begins to make a move similar to theirs, the shorts will have a very hard time exiting due to the tight float and limited liquidity, and the stock could squeeze very, very hard.**

What makes this so potent is the mechanics of the float: just 25% of TRs shares trade freely. Compare this to 40% for GME and AMC, and as high as 85% for BB and EXPR. There are only so many shares out there that the shorts could possibly cover.

Where are the rest of these shares? Theyre with CEO Ellen Gordon, who owns 50% of the common and 85% of Class B shares. Another insider owns another 5% of the common and 15% of the Class B. Gordon has been on the board for 50 years (!) and there is no record of her selling a single share going back to 2000 at least. In fact, no insider has sold a share since 2013, and before that 2008. These are the ultimate diamond hands.

This is effectively a closely-held business that just happens to trade publicly. Worried that we might get burned by insiders like we did on AMC with Silver Lake executing the massive convert and making it easier for shorts to cover? Not here. The insiders dont sell and the shorts will be stuck covering on the tiny float.

And compare the risk in TR to the other squeeze plays at this stage of the trade. EXPR, AMC, etc. are all up 3-4x over the past week, but are all companies that were and are under legitimate fundamental pressure (as they were even before COVID) and facing real liquidity issues, which is of course why they were so heavily shorted. TR is up just 33% on the squeeze but is absolutely fine financially. Sales have been steady and remarkably consistent at $520-550m for years, and are down just ~10% due to COVID. It has over $100m of cash on its balance sheet and no debt. It generates consistent free cash flow, which was as high as $80m last year. This is a brand that everyone knows with no real lasting fundamental pressures, and is not going away anytime soon.

The kicker? This thing probably has UPSIDE on the fundamentals. Its very likely that company gets bought out by a strategic buyer once the long-time CEO (now 90 years old) passes away. For how much? TR did $197m of gross profit in 2019. Lets say it gets bought out by Hersheys, which probably shares all of TRs distribution channels and could wipe out just about all of its (extremely bloated) sales, marketing, and administrative spend in a buyout. Tax-affect TRs gross profit at HSYs effective tax rate of 17%, apply HSYs forward P/E of 22-24x, divide by 66m shares outstanding

**and you see that TR could easily end up getting bought out for upwards of $60 per share. And that may not be too far off.**

**So why is it still trading at $40 per share even after the run on heavily-shorted names? Beats me. But Im buying at these levels (as is whoever made those large bullish option purchases late last Friday).**

**TLDR: This is not just another lottery ticket short squeeze play thats already been carried into the stratosphere. This is an early-stage squeeze that never got picked up by WSB quite as much as some of the others  and even after the once-in-a-generation broad-based squeeze, this one hasnt reached nearly its potential given the low float and limited liquidity, which makes its days short ratio 22-45x HIGHER than the other squeeze candidates, and which will make it very, very hard for shorts to cover. TR is up just 33% while the others are up 3-4x, and its not even trading where it should be on the fundamentals. If youre looking for another squeeze candidate (and one which the brokers havent restricted as heavily) but are antsy about how extended the high-short-interest basket might be  this is your value squeeze play.**

And, honestly, why didnt this one get picked up as much by WSB? What stock could be more memable than Tootsie Roll? Everyone knows it, everyone loves itwho wouldnt be tweeting about Tootsie if this got some play?

By the way, unlike AMC, whose theaters are closed across much of the country, TR is a company that we could support **directly** - go out and buy some Tootsie Rolls. Think about the power of the crowd that WSB showed in bringing GME stock to light and apply it to TR: **If we get just 30% of us WSB retards buying the 36-count boxes on their website for our imaginary girlfriends for Valentines Day, thats over $100m in sales, more than 20% of TTM revenue.** Heres an opportunity not just to buy the stock but to justify it on the fundamentals  by creating the fundamentals.

Title: Corsair Earnings Play
Hi smooth brains,

Posting some info on Corsair and for the new members about what we call an 'earnings play'. Corsair manufactures and sells parts for computers, especially gaming computers, as well as the peripherals used in streaming and gaming. Covid has understandably provided a large uptick in sales and we are coming up on Q4 earnings in 8 days, which will include holiday sales. The stock traded as high as $51.37, and has traded between $35 and $45 for some weeks.

What you need to know:

\-Relatively small market cap (3.43 Billion)

\- Q4 Earning's release: Feb 9th.

\- Recently announced a new product (solid state drives) Jan 28th

\- Expected earnings were recently adjusted, higher:

Net revenue: $1,651 million to $1,666 million.

* Operating income: $186 million to $192 million.
* EBITDA: $194 million to $200 million.

\- Tied for first place in the 'computer hardware' category, alongside Logitech

\- Last quarter Corsair reported a 100% earnings suprise (0.52 vs 0.26 earnings per share)

\- Lockup period for sale of insider shares expires Late March, though the recent announcement to sell non-diluted shares direct to institutions at $35 is promising.

Christmas sales will likely be focused around peripherals, like head phones and streaming gear.

A number of Corsair execs announced they will be selling shares direct, ie. will not dilute common shares, direct to institutional investors at $35 per share. This will, hopefully, reduce volatility in the stock, as there is relatively little available for trade, most of it being locked up with execs and institutional owners. It should also set a floor on near term pricing.

Analyst currently give the company a 'Buy' and 'Strong Buy' rating.

TLDR: buy CRSR.

Earnings date: February 9th.

All time high: $52.37

Current: $38.13

Edit: For people asking about the dip a few weeks ago and for those concerned about the announcement of non-diluted share offering at $35, here is my two cents: There are a lot of reasons for a company to issue shares: to raise money, to decrease volatility, to enrich themselves. That Corsair's execs have decided to sell some of their own shares at $35, is in my mind, a better alternative as it will not necessarily dilute the value of existing stock and it puts it out 'on the market', even if these institutional investors are unlikely to trade these often. This sale could mean the execs think it's not going to $50, but its just as likely they see $35 as a good price, attractive to both them and institutional investors, and they want to both take some money off the table , while simultaneously decreasing the volatility of the stock. The fact that the stock was $38 when they announced this, and that most investors bought in at $12 when CRSR IPO'd 6 months ago, is actually fairly bullish, to my mind. It basically indicates that institutional investors think CRSR is worth more than twice what they paid for it. My 2 cents.

Title: Behavioral Finance applied on Gamestop [Psychological decision-making] [How not to be a paperhand)
Dear fellow retards,

Yes I know it has been quite a harsh week. Manipulation, Counterfeit stock, lazy SEC, fake news, and major loss porn. However, retards strong together.

Please mods, do not just delete this post. I am trying to make a quality post here to show Yahoo Finance we not completely retarded and Gamestop is going to the moon soon.

\---

For years people have thought that investors and market participants are rational. We make choices based on probability and outcome. But here I will give you an example of why we have paper hand bitches in this sub.

Let's say you have to make two decisions.

**Decision 1:**

**A = Sure gain of $240**

**B = 25% probability of a gain of $1000 and 75% probability of a gain of 0$.**

**Decision 2:**

**C = Sure loss of $750**

**D = 75% probability of a loss of $1000 and 25% probability of a loss of 0$.**

&amp;#x200B;

Think about it for a moment before I give the correct answer.

Yes you will take choice A and C. Or B and D if you like to gamble.

But what if we calculate the gains and losses.

&amp;#x200B;

**A &amp; D:**

25% prob. of a gain of $240.75% prob. of a loss of $760 (240-1000).

**B &amp; C:**

25% prob. of gain of $250.75% prob of loss of $750.

So why do you retards pick other choices than B &amp; C, while B&amp;C is the best combi. Because you are subject to **loss aversion.**

What is loss aversion? You facking hate red more than you love green. This is what is happening in the retarded brains of paper hands. You see red, you hate it so much that you don't want to hold for the green at the end of the war.

We tend to accept a sure amount which is less than the maximum amount because you are a fucking paper hand. 

Next to this, you tend to solve the problem in isolation because you are subject to **narrow framing**. You  are so retarded that you only think of green. But do not forget, DFV hold on for over a year. However, he did his math, his DD, his fucking 8-ball game, to know that in the end we will win.

So in short. Switch off you emotions and think about the Gamestop situation as a case. Be aware of the biases and the mind games hedge funds are playing with you right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm no financial advisor nor is this post investment advice. However, I am an economist and even I hold shares of GME.

Also: #delivertheshares, SEC do your fucking job and stop jerking off Citadel.

Title: Why GME squeeze will start on Feb 17
Channeling my inner retard senses I started thinking, if I had placed a bet that GME would go bankrupt last summer and I had billions to invest in the process, I would have done the following 3 things;

1- short the stock cause I wouldn't know how long this would take
2- place a large portion of my bets in put options near zero, cause I would make way more $ that way then just shorting the stock.
3- returned all my used games to GME local strip mall location, cause who else will give me $1 for my old games once GME is no longer?

Focussing on point 2, it's not like you would put billions in a single expriation date. I would probably have splitted this across a couple. Since that trade would have been place 6-12 months prior, probably stick to monthly expriation dates and avoid weekly due to volume needed to be moved.

So Feb 19th is a standard expiration date, so I would expect the short will try to get out 2 days before that day. Probably not successfully do it, and therefore rest will play out at expiration on the 19th. Another chunk will follow the week of March 19th. 

Why not unwind now, it's a losing position and greed will make them want to use as much as the time they can. Because they got burned last time, they won't wait for the 19th, they'll try 2 days before.

Looking at the option calendar, the prior non-weekly expiration was Jan 15th. First expiration of 2021, which would have been a logical date for a first put option taken a year prior. So let's look 2 days before (that's Jan 13th for you artists)... This is when everything really kicked in high gears.

On the 12th GME closed at $19.95, volume of 7M shares (anything prior was also consistently low volume.

But on Jan 13th, volume blew up to 144M shares, GME rose 193% to a high of $38.65 intraday. Looks insignificant today, but that day if was a major change in volume pattern that kicked off what we've seen since.

TLDR: HOLD GME, squeezes happens on monthly expriation calendar, not weeklies. Upcoming one is Feb 19th. So HOLD and buy the dip.

We like the stock is not a financial advice, just a retard making a prediction. 

EDIT1: Position 950 GME at ~138, 16April21 115c, 20Jan23 115c
APE HOLD GME = APE GOES ON ROCKET TO BANANA MOON

Title: 150 - 250 for GME is the sweet spot for hedges. Lowering the price risks VOLUME jumps. THEY KNOW THIS.
Right now the Hedges are in a bit of a bind. I'm not going to repeat all the excellent DD you can already read on the front page. I however will bring up some important thoughts about the publics' spending habits. Buying shares above $150 a share is very expensive for Joe America, average citizen who doesn't do a lot of investments. I have been floored by the number of people willing to spend their real hard-earned money on this movement so far. Congrats to you for keeping all of us afloat. 

We have all seen that VOLUME is very important for keeping GME share price up but volume is not necessary for the ladder attacks to drop the price down. So why haven't they run the price into the ground yet? Because they risk volume jumps. The moment this stock drops below $100/share dramatically increases its affordability. The cheaper it gets the more people will be able to justify adding more to their portfolios. This is exactly what the hedges don't want. They are already in a share shortage. The last thing they want to do is drop the price of GME so low that it causes a massive buying spree. 

So how do they fix this? They do it with FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt). They want the world to think the money train has left the station and all that is left is free fall. They want to crush everyone's spirit so that when it comes time to ground that price, no one will want to buy it. WE CANNOT LET THIS HAPPEN. We need to keep our heads high and TRUST that the short positions have not been resolved. We need to TRUST that the Hedges still have a ton of debt obligations that need to be rectified. Any time we see the share price dip below $100 I suggest buying every share you can get your hands on. I know I will. They will be testing the waters over the next few weeks just to see how much enthusiasm is left for this stock. The rollercoaster will get worse. and seeing red for days/weeks is a test of our collective willpower. 

DO NOT SELL WHEN IT JUMPS TO 800. Do not think this is some lucky fluke and to get out while the getting is good. This is WHAT THEY WANT. They want to crush you so that when they give you crumbs you jump on the chance to show some return. 

TLDR: HOLD, BUY LOW, HOLD until 10k 

GME 600 @ 41

Edit: this is not investment advice. Do not listen to some random guy on the internet for financial decisions.

Edit2: 

Edit3: Mark Cuban on his AMA just confirmed this: So what to do ?
If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.
Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.
I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.
I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.

Title: Buy the dip at open and hold. Hedgies are currently fucked.
We have the hedgies by the nuts currently even though the price doesnt directly express that as a result of the short laddering, very low volume and the hedgies forcing the price to appear lower by ping ponting lower priced stocks between them.

Market will open at a severe fall because of this which just means GME-rocketships at a discount. Thwy. Want. You. To. Paperhand. Do not sell they are desperate as fuck currently. Hence the faje silver stories and the constant ping pong. There is nothing they can do it is all about the holders. Check the buy sell ratio it is currently a joke.

Buy the fucking dip and hold.

Really proud of you diamond hands. Really ahowing this time.

Not a advisor just a donut. I like this stonk.

Over 200 shares now at 130,150,240,330.

Edit: let me be real clear. The price you are now seeing does not matter at all it is a total fugazi.

Edit 2: Volume is currently high, yes. That is a direct correlation with the tons of 100 bulk sale orders created to pressure the stock down in the short lader attack between the firms buying up lower valued stock

Title: A collection of Reddit's best research and DD into where GME will go from here
I've been seeing some amazing pieces of DD on GME's situation on Reddit today, but many of them are quickly getting drowned in new posts. So I figured it might be a good moment to collect some of the best DD in a single mega-thread.

I hightly suggest reading these:

* [GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next ](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/laln2m/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next/)
* [I suspect the hedgies are illegally covering their short positions](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lalucf/i_suspect_the_hedgies_are_illegally_covering/)
* [Follow the crumbs. $GME exposed the meta.](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/)

Does it guarantee anything? No. Does it mean it's still incredibly likely that the squeeze will still happen and have insane repurcussions for lots of people/company's bank accounts and the global economy as long as retailers are willing to hold until the end of February? Yes.

Please let me know if you have any links you think should be added to this list, or if you have any information that debunks any of the links above that I may have missed, because I'm a retard.

Title: AMC stock probably would have been worth it even if all of this wasn't happening
okay take all of this with a grain of salt cause it has tons of speculation and I'm also completely clueless and too ignorant to know whether or not anyone's said anything about this

If any of you cutie pies weren't busy eating crayons and looking at your bedroom wall whilst trying to comprehend the deeper meanings of life, you'd probably have an actual job. The irony here is that I'm going to go about my career in movie production(I know it's not an actual job don't mock me) and what's been going on there for the past few years after Netflix started their expansion. [This](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bOTyoAE6VrRCAZ5GEOg3J?si=Vw4NHRN_TFSsXnCVcleURg) is a really good podcast episode , which I'll TLDR for you cause you retards can't keep your peanut-sized brains concentrated for more than 3 minutes:

Netflix and Amazon have only been gaining profits since covid came to the west and their counterparts - the movie theaters have only been suffering losses. As with any business this creates enormous leverage for both of these companies to  buy off an entire franchise in order to completely monopolize the market.( I don't mean to judge, this is just natural). I guess you could argue that streaming is way more convenient, but if you were to actually read up on that Google Scholar research you'd realize this is not the case for the community and  just want to look at big screens. The platforms just need more places to display their prepaid Hollywood star-packed productions so that they can earn that sweet sweet money, because you'll all go watch that movie, because of that hot actor/actress (that's right I don't discriminate). And even if that isn't the case(highly doubt it), you'd still watch it because it's Netflix. It's only but natural for them to want to want to buy stocks of movie theaters at a discounted price. Does this remind you of something you should be doing right now? 

All in all this is just some industry insight argumentation that only supports not selling anything be it GME(which hasn't shifted to online only because chairmen didn't want to have to fight with Mr. Bald Headed Smeagle Jeff Bezos(we wouldn't have been in the position we were today if it had)) or AMC, but don't follow it as financial advice, because I, like you, am retarded too.

Title: Why GME is still a value investment
I work in marketing, and I can tell you the amount of marketing GME have received through this is probably worth more than their current market cap. As long as GME make the most of their new brand image they can easily see Tesla speed growth. They have their work cut out for them but they have the #1 most important thing (brand image). Think how well Elon Musk does with his brand of being the people's champion/saving the world. (whether you believe Elon Musk really is people's champion doesn't matter, the fact is his brand is super effective). People will fear shorting GME in the future (just like they fear shorting Tesla - just look at billions lost by shorters on tesla). For this reason after the short squeeze I will spend about 50% of gains buying back into GME with a target price of $100-$200. 

tldr:

* GME is now a legitimate value investment due to the value of the free marketing/brand image they are receiving.
* Reddit do not forget.
* People will fear shorting GME like they fear shorting Tesla
* Epstein didn't kill himself
* It is just a matter of time until GME start releasing exciting news about how they are using this exposure/branding/money to grow their business.

This is not investing advice. This is not any kind of advice. This doesn't even exist. I hit keys randomly. Use your own brain. Mass media is corrupt. Maybe I am corrupt. Everybody has biases. I like this stock.

Title: Aphria/Tilray - LEAPs on European Cannabis
Aphria &amp; Tilray Merger 

Aphria and Tilray Combine to Create Largest Global Cannabis Company With Pro Forma Revenue of C$874 Million 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201216005519/en/

&gt;Under the terms of the Arrangement, the shareholders of Aphria will receive 0.8381 shares of Tilray for each Aphria common share, while holders of Tilray shares will continue to hold their Tilray shares with no adjustment to their holdings. Upon the completion of the Arrangement, Aphria Shareholders will own approximately 62 percent of the outstanding Tilray Shares on a fully diluted basis, resulting in a reverse acquisition of Tilray, representing a premium of 23 percent based on the share price at market close on December 15, 2020 to Tilray shareholders. On a pro forma basis for the last twelve months reported by each company, the Combined Company would have had revenue of C$874 million (US$685 million).

The cannabis industry as a whole has extreme growth potential.

We have entered the ~~roaring~~ rolling 20s, where cannabis regulations will ease dramatically.

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Aphria &amp; Tilray are slowly taking over Europe. 

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of Aphria, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face to create desired synergies.

&gt;More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through CC Pharma, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilrays operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**What is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is a leading German Pharmaceutical and Medical Cannabis Distributor that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

Last week, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group.

&gt;AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, "information events" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, "We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

**Tilray &amp; France**

The same day Aphria &amp; CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

&gt;it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

&gt;In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening &amp; Aphria/Tilray will be first in line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised to be the best.

Title: S3 is INTENTIONALLY using MISLEADING numbers to convince you the short squeeze is not happening
[deleted]

Title: A simple note about the calculation of "Short Interest %"
Suppose you're a (not very sophisticated) hedge fund, that wants to manipulate the numbers. A friend of yours from some rating agency could *in theory* **redefine how "Short Interest %" is calculated (!)**. For example, instead of the normal calculation:

THE COMMONLY ACCEPTED CALCULATION: 120 shorted / 100 float = **120% Short Interest**.

He could suggest the following "new calculation", *that includes the "shorted" amount in the denominator as well!!*

TWISTED VERSION: 120 shorted / (120 shorted + 100 float) = **54.5% "adapted Short Interest"**

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know what you think: who would have the audacity to go on such an alleged manipulation and blatant scam?... well... I am not accusing anyone of anything, but you may want to look at that tweet: [https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448) and even see his "justification" for it here: [https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355969693841051650](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355969693841051650)

Oh, and also note that in the "new calculation" version, **the "adapted Short Interest" %** **can** **never** **go above 100%**...

Title: We fail GME if we sell and give the HF's unexpected billions and here is why ....
So here is what is going to happen ...

If  we sell and the HF's drive the stock back down to lets just say $50 ...  That means all the hedges that spent millions upon millions shorting  the stock in the 2-3-400's have made and absolute killing!! This could  be upwards of a 20-30X gain depending on where they originally shorted  GME and mostly likely it was in the 10-15 range. Even if they shorted it  at its peak in the 40's that is still most likely a 8-10x gain.

We brought it this far, and relenting would be doing a massive disservice to GME for any future plans they have! Since they have not released any news, one can assume they did not take advantage of the 3-400 price range and sell some stock to fill their company's bank. So now with it around $150 and going lower, unless this takes the rocket to Mars, we put them in an even tougher position than before.

Can we trust the #'s every guru seems to be posting on Short % and all that? Who knows! The people dont play fair and there is no telling how many people they paid off to spread fake news!

Soooo  in summation, if you sell, you just bought all the hedge funds we have  been fighting new yachts and a 6th house due to the massive bonus they  will pick up off this and their new extremely high short position that  will take another small army to beat down. Just ask Tesla ...

Title: Passfolioapp uses Drivewealth as Clearing broker - GME now sell only!
Recieved email from Passfolioapp team this morning:

Unfortunately our clearing broker DriveWealth let us know that DTCC is now enforcing the NSCC Excess Capital Premium (Procedure XV I.(B)(2)) dramatically increased by buy orders in AMC and GME. This raises their capital requirement by more than 250% and unfortunately they cannot meet the requirement at this time. Because of this unfortunately AMC and GME are now sell only. All pending orders from overnight February 1, 2021 will be canceled at 9:00 a.m. EST on February 2, 2021. DriveWealth continues to explore options to enable buying in AMC and GME and we are advocating for a solution ASAP.

Title: About the GME "Failures to Deliver" numbers.
Please mods let this post go through, I didn't see many ones talking about this, it is a conversation I think we should have.

First we know they are usually underestimated (in an order of 10 to 40 times), we know that when the seller does not provide of the stock after T+2 (settlement date) it is then when the transaction is categorised as failed and enters in the "Failed to delivery" list.

After T+28 days (or T+30 after the trade date) the share enters the "Aged failed to deliver" list if still is not settled.

At this point, the broker was not able to deliver the actual share to the buyer, this results in the broker having to account for the actual share (adjusting its books accordingly).

This could be the reason of why the NSCC asked RH for 3B (a really big number, an order of magnitude bigger from what they are used to). Because they priced the shares actually not existing.

After RH stopped the buying action of shares (which he was not going to be able to deliver), the NSCC lowered the collateral (liquidity) to 700M.

Also not restricting the selling action was benefitial for them because they had to no longer deliver those shares.

RH is still rising as much money as it can (maybe because they are also pricing a necessity to deliver by themselves the actual shares).

As the GME "failed to deliver" data spiked as the stock price was rising, the failed to deliver shares are entering the "Aged fails" list later this month.

This is not investment advice, but I think this is a discussion we should have.

From a comment of [r/DustinEwan/](https://www.reddit.com/user/DustinEwan/):

I was actually just looking at this data last night and [compiled a graph and a bit of information correlating the ftds to the price](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9jbc5/listen_to_me_we_cannot_trust_the_short_interest/gljxh9z/).

I've since included the January data released today. [Here's what the updated graph looks like.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT-zGW9XnxrTZIwm5cYOGbu8p9Xn7b9CzoXhl7_BqpkKLHYQmgFt03_OGkbFNXzhCwqqNKNX5brjlK6/pubchart?oid=1460942882&amp;format=image)

And here's a spreadsheet of the source data. This is straight from the SEC link the OP provided:

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT-zGW9XnxrTZIwm5cYOGbu8p9Xn7b9CzoXhl7\_BqpkKLHYQmgFt03\_OGkbFNXzhCwqqNKNX5brjlK6/pubhtml](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT-zGW9XnxrTZIwm5cYOGbu8p9Xn7b9CzoXhl7_BqpkKLHYQmgFt03_OGkbFNXzhCwqqNKNX5brjlK6/pubhtml)

To put things in perspective, there are \~69.75m shares of GameStop issued by the company. From January 1, 2020 to January 15, 2021 there have been **81,789,932** failures to deliver.

If all of those FtD's are resulting in IOU's in the market that are never fulfilled (that is, a counterfeit share was created through illegal naked short selling), then GameStop's price would have been diluted by **53.9%**.

Put another way, those participating in naked short selling would have *stole* 53.9% of the market cap from GameStop shareholders. In dollars and cents, that would be a theft of roughly $228,886,696 (assuming a share price of $6.08, which it was on January 1, 2020).

Edit:

Furthermore, if we assume that these hedge funds are continuing to short at the same rate, then at a share price of $300, they would have stolen another **$1,522,481,100** just from January 15 - January 31.

If the price crashes, they get to just pocket all of that. This is why they're pulling out all the stops to kill this thing. They're hoping to catch a falling knife without getting hurt, and the higher they can drive the price without the whole thing exploding in their face, the more they can steal.

Title: Some reassuring (?) DD for those who cannot be bothered to read all other DD
Yes, this is my first post, and yes, my karma is low, but as you will see, I am not exactly a Melvin-bot.

&amp;#x200B;

As most of you, ive spent considerable amounts of time reading up on this very strange occurrance. As I see it, a dip today (or even red numbers this entire week) was to be expected. However, as I did my research, I happened to stumble upon "[CFR  242.204 - Close-out requirement](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2018-title17-vol4/pdf/CFR-2018-title17-vol4-sec242-204.pdf)". I am a swedish law student, so of course this was of huge interest to me, even though I dont know how to refer to it correctly (and also explains why this text is missing some characters). Now, what this text tells me, is that the shorters will **have to** cover their positions sometime this month. [I also read](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) that there is a chance that this is requirement to cover the shorts can be fulfilled by simply using fraudulent shares that do not really exist. However, as lawmakers seem to be looking into what is currently happening, I am not so sure this will be their chosen method, as it means they are basically exposing their fraud for the whole world to see. Of course, another option is for them to see this as perhaps the last time they can save themselves through this loophole before its eventually covered. In my mind, theres a 50/50 chance of either option, however I am certainly hoping for the first alternative.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, for some other thoughts. If the Robinhood-limit is actually set due to liquidity-issues, I believe they would ease up on it at some point during this week, assuming they can manage to locate the liquidity needed for this. IE. - assuming they are not as evil as we might have thought, the demand should rise and the price should go up. If they arent, well I guess we will have to wait and see what happens.

&amp;#x200B;

What however seems pretty clear, at least to me (who doesnt really know what the hell is going on more than what Ive been told and managed to read up on) - something is going on that they dont want the retail investors to know about. Sure, some short positions have been covered (about 37-80% remaining, depending on the source), but how can we know these are legitimately covered, or even have been covered at all, as we dont have the short statistics yet?

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR - There are laws in place that say the naked shorts have to be covered sometime soon. We dont actually know how many of these are still floating around, or if they even exist anymore (any hedgie with a brain should make sure to try and cover these first), but if there is a substantial amount floating around, we should see a peak when they have to cover. Again, as I am not an american law student, I am uncertain as to how this document should be understood, but this is my understanding.

&amp;#x200B;

Second, if RH is really prohibiting buying because of liquidity-issues, this could probably be resolved during the week, with trading reassumed and demand increasing. If not, well that is clearly beyond my comprehension.

&amp;#x200B;

Third, I dont know where this is going. I am currently holding seven shares bought at 235-289, so you bet I want to see the prices go back to where they were a few days ago. I am also not your financial advisor (obviously), and you should probably not take my word for anything, but the sources i refer to could be a good read.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont actually know if this was even worth reading, but hopefully it could tell you what to look for (and where to find it). Stonks only go up, and ape together strong 

Title: $PM is a great value play
Hello fellow retards!

First this is not a short squeeze or a this is going to make 100x post. However, $PM is a great value play in my opinion. Obviously not financial advice, I am just a retard. Also $PM may be deemed unmoral. This post is not based on morals, only on financials. I am a non smoker, with no intention of using any nicotine product and would urge every reader to not start using nicotine products, due to their addictiveness.

**TLDR:** PM owns the leading cigarette brand marlboro and have worldwide operation, excluding the USA and China. PM introduced iqos (I quit ordinary smoking) a few years ago. It heats the tobacco and does not burn it. It is supposedly as addictive, but less harmful. The iqos revenues already make up 25% of their revenue and the unit sales are growing at roughly 30%. The market is potentially bigger than cigarettes. $PM is underpriced at a PE of 16.

First, a bit of history. The cigarette business had explosive exponential growth starting in the early 1900s. The growth stopped when the public  got aware of the gigantic negative side effects of smoking (lung cancer). However, the revenues continued to grow, not because of unit sales, but because of price increases. It turns out that cigarettes are highly addictive and it is difficult to give up the habit. Still worldwide unit sales peaked in 2011 at 5700 billion sticks a year. In 2019 they were down to 5100 billion. In the US for example the unit sales peaked in 1997 and are down more than half.

To understand the reason why it is so difficult to quit one needs to understand how nicotine is delivered into the body. By breathing in the nicotine it gets absorbed by your lungs in gets directly into the blood stream. This results in a peak of nicotine. This peak is called nicotine hit. It is the main reason why cigarettes are so addictive. It is also likely that marlboro delivered a product that makes more addictive by changing the ph value of the smoke and therefore increasing the adoption (I think this is true, but I am unsure. Mostly I dont want to get sued by pm). So to make a nicotine product more addictive you have got to increase the speed of absorption. To my knowledge vapes are less addictive, because of a smaller nicotine spike.

$PM engineered iqos in a way that it is able to deliver the same nicotine spike as cigarettes do (they even put pictures of the pharmacokinetic in inverstor information). iqos heats the tobacco, but does not burn it. So instead of burning cigarette, they heat so called heet sticks. iqos has less harmful aerosols in its "smoke" since the tobacco  gets heated not burnt. There is no definitive answer to whether iqos is less harmful in the long run, but the indications are here that is less harmful in a significant way. This is underlined by the FDA categorization as a modified risk tobacco product. So to my mind there is a product that is as addictive as cigarettes, but less harmful.

iqos was first introduced in the east asia and australia region and it was a blazing success. The first year with major sales was 2016 with 7billion unit sales. It jumped to 33 billion unit sales in 2017 to 30 billion unit sales in 2019. In Japan (the first market in which iqos was introduced) their unit sales of heets amount to 20% of the entire cigarette market (after something like 5 years). This is a crazy amount of market share. PM itself has a worldwide market share of only 28%. There have already been many product iterations of the heater and I am confident that there are more and better products to come. It should be noted that the overall market in japan cigarette market contracted since the introduction of iqos.

Given the success in Japan PM started the roll out in other countries, currently they are increasing their sales in europe aggressively. I live in central europe and am seeing the increase in iqos users on the streets. So to my mind over the next years PM will be able to grow worldwide heet sales by a multitude. Their aspirational targets are to sell more than 250 billion smoke free sticks by 2025, while they sold 60 billion smoke free sticks in 2019. To my mind this target is achievable and may even be conservative. Further, I believe that they will continue their sales further after the year 2025. Btw. skimming through the iqos subreddit suggest that people how switch to iqos smoke more heets than they previously smoked cigarettes.

The cigarette business has incredible high margins. Based on their net revenue (excluding excise taxes) their operating margin is more than 40% and increasing. This increase is partly because of the increase in revenue of iqos. I think that the pricing power may even increase due to iqos. Since iqos needs a heating device a nespresso like system is created with switching costs. 

So how much should be a company like this be worth. Personally I value it at something like 130$ per share. (trades around 80$). However, when pricing it in comparison to something like $PEP I am shocked that $PM trades around a PE of 17, while $PEP trades at 27. 

Summary: To my mind the earnings are going to grow at a rate of something like 5% per year for the foreseeable future. The iqos segment is growing its units sales at around 30% with little cash expenditure. Their market share will probably increase over the next decade. However, the market size is uncertain. To my mind it is completely possible that the market size will grow over the next decades. Pricing a business like this with a $PE of 17 is insane to me in the current environment with $PEP at 27. To my mind it is an incredible save and stable business, that will have many more decades of profitability. Maybe we even enter some kind of nicotine renaissance of smoking (or heeting in this case). Maybe even the percentage of users cigarettes and heets user will go up and we enter a "golden age" of nicotine, like the 1910-1940s.

GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next

Hello all,

If you don't recognize my name then perhaps you haven't seen my posts at the start of all this. You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

Things looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.

Now, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.

But what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.

Melvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.

One of two things can happen to these people:

1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able
2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.

This logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.

So what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.

Now, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**

If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?

Normally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.

If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.

Another question to consider:

If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.

The final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.

Now, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.

Now, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:

1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.
2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.

**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.

I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.

**EDIT:** For people claiming the liquidity defense, please tell me why trading on TSLA was not blocked during its insane short squeeze. If that sounds aggressive I'm sorry, I'm truly trying to find an answer to this question.

Title: Something to keep you from paper handing

From u/Anttte

Before I head to bed I feel the need to leave behind three important pieces of information behind for tomorrow. The first one is this:

https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/interactive-chart

This link provides the information about todays volume. The volume represents the trades that are happening. And today the volume has been really low. This means people are not selling. We have been holding, which should drive the price up.

The second one is this:

https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml

This link provides the information about todays supply/demand considering buy and sell orders (on fidelity). The demand is WAY too high for the supply to meet, which should also drive the price up.

The third is this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la8ox3/at_these_levels_its_not_about_the_price_of_the/

Hedge funds are "fraudulently creating more shares" and retail are holding. They are using very ugly tactics in order to bring the price down to a number that satisfies them since even $225 is beyond the amount they are prepared to absolutely-have-to-fucking-pay.

Please stay educated. Do not trade emotionally. And lastly get some rest. We do not know when this shitshow will end. But hopefully we will have left a stain of hope in history behind us.

Title: Short Ladders Are Not Real
This past couple of weeks WSB has been the QAnon of finance. Much of what you are told here is wrong.

You can protect yourself to a degree by learning at least the very basics of how markets work. This post will explain to you how prices work on an exchange, and why "short ladders" are not even a coherent concept.

**How markets work**

Exchanges have [order books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_book) in which they track interest in a stock. Orders to buy and orders to sell stay in the order book until someone submits an order that matches their price.

The highest price present on buy orders is called the *bid price*.
The lowest price present on sell orders is called the *ask price*.
The difference between the two is called the *spread*.

When you submit an order to the exchange, it trades at the best price it can get. If you're selling, it will sell to the highest bidder even if you said you were willing to sell for zero.

It is possible for companies to trade off-exchange, but when you are looking at the price of a stock on Google or wherever, the price is based on trades that took place on the exchange. For this reason it is common if you're looking at a feed giving you prices in real time to see the price going up and down between two prices for a number of seconds as people sell at bid price and buy at ask price.

**Why short ladders are not possible**

Short ladders are described as two hedge funds selling back and forth to one another at an increasingly lower price.

This makes no sense for the following reasons.

* Off-exchange transactions do not result in ticks. Nobody sees them.
* You cannot target another participant on the exchange to sell to. You have to go through the order book.
* If the order book has $10000 of bids at $100, you cannot drive the price down to $99 except by selling $10000 of stock at $100.

This is a theory made up by someone who has no knowledge of how markets work - if they understood the basics they would at least try to make it believable.

If you google "short ladder attack" you will get a bunch of hits on Reddit, [a StackExchange question](https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/135807/closing-shorted-positions-via-short-ladder-attacks) debunking it, and pretty much nothing else of note. If you google "short attack" your top two hits are a description from CFO.com of companies releasing a report at the same time they short e.g. alleging financial irregularities, and a piece of frothing madness from SeekingAlpha where some nutter in 2014 makes up a bunch of nonsense involving "counterfeit shares".

This is not real.

Title: This guy just wrote the single most important piece of DD on GME you will read this week.
u/forzan wrote [this beauty](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lanf94/gme_is_a_time_bomb_and_its_highlighting_a_severe/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) and everyone needs to read it STAT.


TL;DR:


- Short interest seemingly falling despite no shares left to borrow (also caused by ticker dropping over 10% in a day which makes it unshortable), probably because it's masked by millions of new synthetic longs created on 28/01


- Synthetic longs likely defensively created by Market Makers who don't pay interest on them for 21 days, to buy time to protect themselves in the event HFs and brokers aren't enough to cover the squeeze;


- Simultaneously, DTCC recognized financial liability in this squeeze could eventually reach clearing houses if the market makers went bankrupt and on the same date increased collateral requirements to purchase GME to 100%;


- MMs can keep this going for a really long time if needed, but that does not mean forever.

Now u/forzan get in here so no one thinks I wrote this shit.

Also this is not financial advice, I am a professional window licker. Do your own DD and reach your own conclusions.

Title: Anybody things $CLDR can start a rally from here?
I have been holding $CDLR since it was at 9$. And I think it still can make a rally and break the ATH pretty soon. Here are my reasons to believe that. 

**Technicals**

It has broken the downtrend and is continuously making new higher highs. Next major resistance levels I see are only around 20$, 22$ and 23$

[CLDR Daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/padvj8ahh1f61.png?width=2998&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f79a43bf031ef5fde394d8877d1aa55dd2016258)

&amp;#x200B;

**Option Chain**

From option chain perspective it looks like it is doing pretty good too.

**Fundamentals**

From fundamentals perspective I think they are doing much better than where their stock price stands. I feel they are undervalued due to some crazy events last year after they merged with their competitor and their own CEO left the organisation. 

Since the change of the CEO there has been some uptick movement and probably it can pick up some pace soon. I think this can be another hidden gem. 

Open to suggestions/discussions on it to see if anybody would like to join me in the journey.

Title: We won't actually know how much GME is still shorted until the 9TH OF FEBRUARY
Short interest position is reported to FINRA twice per month and DOESN'T NECESSARILY CORRELATE with daily short volume. They are two different metrics that both have *short* in the name and I feel I've seen a few posts that are intentionally conflating the two to try and confuse people.

A decent explanation is here [OTC Markets BLOG](https://blog.otcmarkets.com/2018/11/13/understanding-short-sale-activity/)

FINRA Reporting schedule is [here](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest)

All these people saying that the squeeze has or hasn't happened are talking out their ass unless they're privy to some insider information, which newsflash they probably are fucking not. I'm holding until I know for sure. I'm confident I'll be dabbing billionaire tears with my  held handkerchief but I'm also prepared to make an exit strategy come February 9th if the Short Interest ratio has somehow dropped to nothing.

In other news, if you're wondering what a good common sense askance from ~~your corrupt as fuck federal agency~~ the SEC to keep something like this from happening again, require more regular reporting of short sale positions. BiWeekly is a joke intended to keep the process as opaque as possible.

30 GME @ 210, 35 GME @ 316

Title: A brief history of Melvin Capitals &amp; Point72s founding
**BE CAREFUL - LOTS OF WORDS**

I love the different forms of DD we had in the past couple of weeks. Most of them were very technical and I personally found a more and more increasing interest in the people we love to hate. 

I spend the past couple of hours trying to understand what happened in a time where most of us were busy getting to the new level cap of Lich King whilst boomers managed to fuck up the economy. Yes. Im talking about 2008.

You see, Melvin Capitals story begins under the wings of Steve Cohens S.A.C. Capital. US Attorney Preet Bharara described them as following in 2013: 

*  culture of corporate corruption
*  institutional indifference to unlawful conduct \[that\] resulted in insider trading that was substantial, pervasive, and on a scale without known precedent in the hedge-fund industry.
*  a veritable magnet of market cheaters

If that isn't off to a great start, right? To understand the story I'm about to tell you, here a short summary of how SAC was structured: 

SAC was structured like a bicycle wheel, with the spokes consisting of about 100 portfolio managers with their own teams of analysts and traders working in competition with the other teams. Camaraderie in SACs offices was low. At the center was Cohen, 57, the only connector between the different groups, who would take the best ideas from each and trade on them himself. Aside from losing money, there was nothing Cohen hated more than a portfolio manager who didnt communicate vigorously and often.

In 2008 two employees were charged with insider trading. One of them was Mather Martoma who was involved in insider trading with a new Alzheimer drug that first showed positive and then negative results which helped Cohen get out at a perfect time and thus avoided a $275million loss. 

The other was Jon Horvath, he claimed that his asshole boss Steinberg told him get insider information to get better trades or else he would be fired. So he did with DELL and also passed this information to Steinberg. With this insider information he found out DELL was going to have a bad quarter and built up a massive short position only to find out that his even BIGGER ASSHOLE BOSS COHEN was long DELL. And FUCK was he scared of Cohen, the ragey ass went on a rampage whenever he lost money so he mailed Steinberg to tell him about his concerns. Now it gets interesting. Steinberg told Cohen and Cohen told Steinberg to figure out who the fuck was right. Jon or the person suggesting him this trade  Gabriel fucking Plotkin. You may be asking Who dis? -it's **Melvin Capitals later fucking founder**. After some back and forth Plotkin realized Jon had the better source and confirmed to sell the long position. After its earnings announement DELL dropped 14%. Good job Jon. 

Later that evening, Cohen sent Steinberg a message that read: Nice job on dell. Steinbergs response was, Thanks this ole dog can still hunt.

This happened again. This time Steinberg/Jon being long, Cohen short. Here a chat: 

&gt;AIM:mike72ms \[Steinberg\] dell rpts thrusday  
AIM:cas \[Cohen\] y    
AIM:mike72ms **we like it**weve been good here if u remember  
AIM:cas call me its a shame-cause I can be helpful to you too but that;s life  
AIM:mike72ms steve I have an analyst that covers this stock he has industry contacts im not hiding anything from u

Cohen replied: I would prefer to talkon phone.

I decided to leave in the chat because both sound like fucking retards and Cohen like a salty 9 year old. Truely, no different to us

Martoma, the guy with the Alzheimer drug was convicted to a 9 year prison sentence. 

Jon decided to work with prosecutors to try help fuck over Steinberg but in 2015 the case was abandoned. 

In 2011 Plotkin was apparently investigated for trading Weight Watchers based on insider information. An SAC spokesperson denied this claim however by saying Gabe Plotkin has built a successful career on a commitment to sound fundamental research

In 2013 SAC pleaded guilty to an insider trading charge, paid an $1.8 billion penalty and changed its name to Point72 Asset Management. Cohen shrunk the companies size and said goodbye to many of his portfolio managers. 

In 2013 the SEC also charged Steve Cohen with a failing to supervise civil charge in regards to Martoma with the goal to give Cohen a lifetime ban from supervising funds that manage outside money. In the end they settled for a two year ban which I guess is almost the same thing. It is rumoured that Plotkin is the mysterious Portfolio Manager A in this charge

In 2014-2015 Cohen took steps to increase compliance and oversight at Point72. He hired former F.B.I agents and federal prosecutors. For example Kevin J. OConnor and Vincent Tortorella. Some saw this as an effort to gain the confidence of regulators and permit him to again manage money for outside investors.

In 2014 Gabriel Plotkin, one of Cohens most successful traders founded Melvin Capital. Cohen backed him with a small loan of 200 milion dollars.

In a memo sent to more than 800 employees of Point72, Mr. Cohen said that after SAC pleaded guilty, he vowed that what happened to SAC would never happen to Point72. The settlement is not and cannot  be a reason to become complacent, Mr. Cohen wrote, adding that the firm would become a leader in compliance.

Fact is, the SEC spent almost a decade trying to get dirt on Steve Cohen and failed. Plotkin got a slap on the wrist by being hinted at in the civil charge against Cohen and Steinbergs case was dropped. But hey, the **analyst** who forwarded insider information in 2008 about an alzheimer drug will be freed from prison soon after 9 years in jail. I know insider trading is irrelevant to the current situation however I found the story interesting because it shows by what rules they play and what type of people they are. 

TL;DR: The people behind Melvin and friends are frauds and cheaters. They never played by the rules, never will. SEC knows this but literally can't do anything.

everything is allegedly, i dont know anything, there are probably mistakes in this story, im no lawyer, no financial advice, no suicidal tendencies, have a rocket

They cannot cover their shorts until the price falls through the floor, and if they do it would push the price up if they did it in any meaningful volume.

Title: DDDD - Is GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold?
This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or "counterfeit" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.

Much of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.

One thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**Methodology**

I'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.
2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.
3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.

**The Code**

    from collections import defaultdict
    import time
    import requests
    POLYGON_API_KEY = '&lt;ADD YOUR API KEY HERE&gt;'
    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&amp;apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY
    
    data
    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))
    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm
    for line in f:
        parts = line.split('|');
        date = parts[0]
        ticker = parts[2]
        try:
            fails = int(parts[3])
            price = float(parts[5])
            value_of_fails = price * fails
            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)
        except ValueError:
            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')
            pass
    
    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():
        day = int(date[-2:])
        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))
        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])
        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] &gt; 10000000, sorted_stocks)
        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:
            val_of_fails = data[0]
            num_fails = data[1]
            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))
            res = req.json()
            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':
                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))
                continue
            else:
                try:
                    volume = res['volume']
                except KeyError:
                    print(res)
            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)
            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100
            print('{: &lt;6} ${: &lt;5} {: &lt;9} / {: &lt; 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))

Here's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.

If everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value &gt; 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.

EDIT - Someone pointed out a mistake in my script. Fixed, and added a bit more data

EDIT 2 - For those without enough brain wrinkles / attention span to interpret this - There may have been shady shit in the first few days of Jan, but doesn't look like anything went on in the second week. Will need to wait till Feb 15 to see data in the last few weeks of Jan. I'll probably do some more analysis when that time comes

Title: GME Daily Short Interest Data

Title: GME: Evidence of Short Seller Collusion (for Months) and an Explanation for Why Short Estimates are Probably Way Off!
MODS: THIS IS IMPORTANT, PLEASE DON'T REMOVE

So far, many of you have seen and heard about the ladder attacks that have been happening with GME recently. What if I tell you that "short interest is going down" is the result of shorts unwinding their previous ladder attacks?

Let me explain:

Today, I saw something very strange on Webull. I saw shares of GME being traded in L2 data for \~$14, \~20$, and around \~$30. I managed to take a screenshot from one of these sales and in order to make sure that something is very wrong, I made a limit buy order at $30 before it happened again. The order obviously didn't get filled:

&amp;#x200B;

[L2 Time &amp; Sales Data \/ removed my other limit orders](https://preview.redd.it/lmjh2m5bn0f61.png?width=2732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5745279c389cb4101b55f1b9771f776263a2138b)

At first, I thought this might be a glitch, but after thinking about it more, it clicked! I've been following GME for months, the key is within why these prices were chosen ($14, $20, $30)! Folks who've been following GME closely know that GME broke $14 for the first time after the Microsoft deal. Both $20 and $30 were also important breakthroughs for GME's price.

So why are we seeing these prices again today? I have a theory! Short sellers were having ladder attacks back then, but the way they probably did them was the following:

Let's say hedgefund A and hedgefund B are colluding to bring the price down. Since there are no shares available to borrow, A buys 1000 shares and lends them to B. B then shorts those shares but makes sure that A is the one buying them. A lends these shares to B again and B shorts them again. This continues until the price gets down to the desired level. This artificially increases the short interest of GME, but in reality, only 1000 shares have been changing hands. If you look carefully, you see these shares that are being traded in the above screenshot have slightly different prices.

Here is the thing: these short-sellers are probably unwinding the previous ladder attacks now to reduce the artificial short interest they have previously created! The fact that there are not many shares to borrow even though short interest "in theory" seems to be going down also proves this! I'm baffled by how dumb these short sellers are to actually use the prices that they used to create those ladder attacks! They are not even trying to hide their tracks at this point!

Now you might ask "what if all of the short interest is artificial?", the answer is an obvious no! Why do you ask? because if they didn't have massive short positions, they wouldn't have to do these ladder attacks, to begin with!

How do I know (or rather guess) that the actual short interest hasn't gone down by a lot? 2 reasons:

1. The stock is still hard to borrow in almost all brokerages (AFAIK)
2. The following screenshot shows that there are only %15.9 of all the outstanding shares have been bought at a higher price than today's closing price, which would be around  11.09m shares:

[Position Cost Distribution](https://preview.redd.it/n0okmsbug0f61.jpg?width=1493&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c8638cfede5177ba9e87107aa1f93dd8e20494c)

As you know, today's closing price was a lower price than the price of almost all trades that happened today and Friday, which means one thing: There are AT MOST 11.09m shares left in the float and all that is happening is that they are just changing hands! So the short interest AT MOST has gone down by (0.159\*69.75m=) 11.09m in the past two days (unless the folks who have lent these shares out have sold them immediately after they received them, which seems unlikely to me since I haven't seen any SEC filings from institutions)!

What I do not know is this: do these short-sellers report these artificial short interests in their official report of "short selling" or not! My guess is that they don't, because:

1. They are probably scared of getting caught!

2. Another reason why I think these artificial short sales are not included in the official short interest numbers is that short interest estimates for GME has always been off and this can explain why this has been the case (when they are using these type of ladder attack, the estimates are probably higher than reality, and when they are unwinding them the estimates are probably lower).

3. I think it is also very likely that they are unwinding these positions now to cover their tracks!

Also, note that shorts don't have to "borrow and sell" to each other to create a ladder, they can just "buy and sell" from each other. However, I think they've done this to intentionally mess with the short interest estimates!

Based on this evidence, I believe that the squeeze has not squoze! This also suggests that short-sellers have been committing crimes for a while now in my opinion since this type of collusion is obviously illegal!

**Disclaimer: I'm not a financial adviser and this is not financial advice. This is for entertainment purposes only and purely speculative even though it might look otherwise! I've been long GME and have a lot of GME shares.**

Hopefully, SEC will take a close look at what these short-sellers are doing, but given that it seems like this has been going on for a while, I doubt that anyone will do anything about this!

Title: PLTR lock-up expiration and S-1 filing
Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. I am just sharing what I have read all day today instead of working my day job. Please do your own research to confirm what I am going to say below.

Hey traders,

As Palantir's earnings is coming around the corner (2/16), their lock-up expiration will also come along at third trading session day after the ER, so 2/19. And people who have been watching PLTR should be aware that the lock-up exp may be a huge negative catalyst as several ANALysts have been talking shit on the stock for potential unloading of 80% shares, crashing the stock price.

As a techie who has deep conviction in the company and its tech (browse the sub for plenty of DDs on company's outlook), I was confused when I saw [webull's information on the stock's free float at 1.2b vs. shares outstading at 1.7b](https://imgur.com/a/o5YePOB). Does this mean the lock-up expiration will free up only &gt;400m shares (if yes, BULLISH)? It got confusing so I decided to look into the s-1 filing specifically for the shares structure and forth.

**NOTE**: This is my first time diving deep into a stock like this so **PLEASE** correct me if any part of this incorrect or too biased. I have tried my best to not skip any unclear terminology I faced along the way but in the end, I am not an analyst so I have limited knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

# [S-1 filing](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001321655/896d430c-206d-49a4-9ffb-b83d9bf6f758.pdf)

As of **September 1st, 2020**, this was the total number of shares:

https://preview.redd.it/wq5sqbv3t0f61.png?width=1133&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5ff5a477cb1567b43f9393cdff2aa712f734820

Ignoring/Including small figure RSUs, growth units, and exercisable options:

On first trading day back in September:

* 383,609,647 fully-diluted shares (including stock options) was available to trade
* Registered additional 257,135,415 shares to be available to trade
* Due to Investors Rights Agreement, they "expected" up to 656,018,583 shares registered additionally to be available to trade
* Total: Up to 1,296,763,645 fully-diluted shares (which seems accurate according to 1.2b free float)

On lock-up expiration day (2/19):

* 1,863,150,291 fully-diluted shares will be available to trade
   * From what I understand, registering shares allow them to be available to trade so we subtract 257,135,415 and 656,018,583 shares
   * Adjusted: 949,996,293 fully-diluted shares
* Result: Total of 2,246,759,938 fully-diluted shares.
   * The figure above shows 2,173,481,929 fully-diluted shares. The math lines up considering additional RSUs, options could have been issued since September.
* So the lock-up expiration doesn't free up **80%** of outstanding, but instead **42%**.

All as of Feb 1, 2021, they sold the following shares:

**Executives and directors:**

* Alexander Karp: **10,244,631 shares**
* Stephen Cohen: **5,133,000** shares

* Peter Thiel: **27,382,866** shares
* David Glazer: **2,261,507** shares
* Matthew Long: **848,811** shares
* Ryan Taylor: **1,075,892** shares
* TOTAL: **50,318,461** shares

Source: [nasdaq insider activity](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/pltr/insider-activity)

None of the large shareholders/VCs/institutions sold! Also notice how bitch Soros is not even in the list! 

The insider selling can be said to be pretty high in normal circumstances. But this can be explained in that since PLTR was a direct listing, they had to offload some shares, as well as register a lot of shares, so that the stock had liquidity (something Robinhood doesn't have ). Also, not to mention the company has been around since 2003 so this may have been the first time for the big time insiders to cash out. (Note that these arguments can be seen as biased so take it with a grain of salt).

&amp;#x200B;

# What will happen on lockup expiration day?

I think the following will happen:

*  will sell
* Some short sellers will come by for sure
* Insiders will obviously sell some. But it's not going to be anywhere near the impact that s are fearing.

**Some key rumors:**

* Some insiders are looking to buy up shares - [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kym23z/pltr_folks_listen_in_karp_and_cohen_to_make_188m/)
* Insiders already had chances to liquidate over the years - [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l49dut/pltr_vs_child_rapists_starvation_hurricanes/) (a good DD overall as well from ex-Palantir engineer)

I am personally planning to buy the dip if there is a big one, but I doubt the red will last long and the stock will go up onwards. I will be putting aside cash to buy the dip

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR; I think lock-up expiration won't mean shit to the stock and I am bullish**

Positions: 200 shares of PLTR, 84 LEAPS of Jan 2022 $40 calls

Obligatory PLTR TO THE MOON 

Edit 1: typo

Edit 2: included lock-up expiration date, which is third trading day from q4 2020 ER (estimated 2/11) so probably 2/14?

Edit 3: They announced q4 2020 er to be 2/16 so the expiration will be 2/19

Title: So you want to squeeze silver
Over the last several days there has been a mania regarding the decades old strategy that large institutions have inflicted on the price of silver. Finally, the little guy has gained awareness and has a chance to expose and potentially beat them at their own game. As a full time retail trader focusing in the metal markets I am familiar with the supply issues and the suppression of price of silver. The idea that if the demand for physical silver rose and caused a scarcity and therefore a forced demand of deliverables could in turn seriously crush the larger institutions that are net short is not new to me. I have been giving a lot of thought to the idea that many degens in this and other forums have expressed in attempting to squeeze the gay bears through heavy call flow on SLV and AG. I was incredulous to begin with as we all know how easily the hedgies can change the game on us smaller fish.

In a Eureka moment it dawned on me that instead of trying to take down the entirety of the Silver Shorters, there could be more of an affect if you concentrated on one specific area. This is where SLV comes into play......stay tuned to the end as the plot thickens with even more manipulation at foot.

By now we have all heard of call buying gamma effects. Well, in SLV we have many key components that could cause the same effect that we saw in GME. The list is as follows:

* $25 dominant options strike
* The 25 strike relates to an area where major hedging by dealers needs to take place in order for them to  
stay solvent in their SLV positions.
* Hedge wall, where dealers are likely to change the way that they hedge, is currently sitting at $25
* The key gamma strike, where most of the open interest that is related to gamma, is tied to $25
* This indicates that at the $25 is where most of the dealer hedging needs to kick in.
* The key delta strike, where most of the ITM strikes are, is....you guessed it $25
* On top of these greeks, the top PUT OI and top CALL OI are at, yet again $25

We want to see the key gamma strike or hedge wall shift up high as this implies that dealers are buying at higher prices. Dealers are carrying a negative net gamma which means that they will get hurt as price moves up which causes them to buy more shares to keep up with their hedges. We currently have a much higher call volume than put volume as the 8/19/2021 EXP is 4.1 mil calls to 770k puts.

  
If SLV breaks under $25 you will see dealers begin to unwind there positions causing in influx of VOL. Moving forward (above $25) VOL is relatively low. This is due to the volume being distributed over a wide range of strikes. If there were to be a concentration of call buying at the $25 this will in turn increase the VOL above the $25 level.

  
If you want to see a Squeeze type move, we need to see an addition of call options at strikes &gt;25 which would shift the momentum higher.

  
Here is where the plot thickens: As I was writing this I went to look at the AUG chain for SLV and noticed that it has disappeared across all platforms that I use. DO YOU THINK THAT THEY ARE FINALLY SCARED!!! Time will tell. The same effect could be accomplished by going one month out to the SEPT contracts or by buying shorter dated contracts and continuing to roll them until the dealers have drowned in that one position.

As with every disclaimer. This is not financial advice, and I wrote this as a research paper. Trade at your own risk and do your own research. Have fun and enjoy those tendies. 

My position: nothing currently, watching 25 carefully as I said.

Title: How To Avoid A FOMO Buy In 10 Steps
This checklist might save your day or at least save you some dollars. 

You might think that you would never FOMO into a stock or you might be wondering if this applies to you. Ask yourself these questions to find out if you need the checklist. 

- Have you ever thought of buying some super hyped shares at ATH?

- Have you thought about joining the team in the squeeze on stockthatshallnotbenamed? (Ps. there are no teams in retail investing its every man for himself)

- Do you use WallStreetBets? 

If you answered yes to any of the precursor questions below then you are in danger of a FOMO trade and need this checklist. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HOW NOT TO FOMO CHECKLIST 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Ask yourself why you want to buy the stock. Are you jealous of others gains? Do you want to be part of that weeks big thing? If yes to either then do not buy. Jealous trading is bad trading. 

2. Warren Buffet said be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy. Ask yourself if people are being greedy with the stock you want to buy, do not buy if they are. 

3. Ask yourself am I being a sheep? Sheep do not make money on the stock market, they dont even understand the stock market, they are sheep. Dont be a sheep. 

4. Where did you see the stock? If it was on the news dont buy it. If its trending on one of the subreddits then its probably too late. 

5. Is it often appearing on the subreddit and being regularly pushed by the same small crowd? Watch out cause without proof they are probably bag holders hoping to pass the bag to you. 

6. Can you explain to somebody what the company does and why it is a good idea to buy it? If not then you shouldnt buy it yourself. 

7. Is the market mostly red or mostly green that week? Sell on green weeks and buy on red weeks. It might feel like the other way around at the time but thats emotional trading. 
8. Is it a meme stock? If yes then be an early adopter or dont adopt at all. 

9. Have you got spare capital? If money is no issue to you or if you are making a small punt that wont harm your finances then go ahead. If you are making a big, late move into a meme stock then youll be seeing red.

Title: Madman Theory and $GME: The Biggest Game of Financial Chicken in History
Machiavelli once wrote that sometimes it is ["a very wise thing to simulate madness."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourses_on_Livy) 

With recent revelations of possible (if not likely) share counterfeiting, continued aggressive short ladder attacks, and increasing media distractions/disinfo, I have a theory I want WSB's input on.

# Short sellers are not just cheating at the game, they're scaring the referees into submission.

What we know:

1. Volume was incredibly low today, thanks to restrictions on platforms popular with retail investors (and good monkes holding).
2. Despite low volume, we saw ridiculous price drops as firms traded cash to ladder the price down.
3. Even with conservative/favorable estimates on short interest, HFs/MMs/Brokerages are still extremely exposed because...
4. There is a massive synthetic shares problem with no real way out, except continuously kicking the can down the road. As beautifully put by /u/forzan, ["their cure is a poison they can't stop taking."](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lanf94/gme_is_a_time_bomb_and_its_highlighting_a_severe/)

**This all points to textbook** [**Brinkmanship**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brinkmanship)**, or a form of** [**Madman Theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madman_theory)**.**

GME shorts have taken the financial system hostage, strapped it into the back seat, and are driving full-speed-ahead at retail investors in a massive game of chicken.  From what we've seen, hedgies are willfully doubling down on a terrible bet, to the point that it threatens to crash the market.

They know they lost the match, so their only option is to work the referees. My guess is that they're trying to fill the powder keg even more, and make the potential fallout so destructive, the SEC has no choice to step in and halt trading. Whatever fines or punishments are levied can't possibly be as bad as the alternative, which is an extinction event for multiple firms (HFs and brokerages).

# So how can the little   respond?

***You've got to convince them you're more irrational than they are.*** This shouldn't be difficult for this group of shit-throwing apes.

From the Wikipedia article on brinkmanship:

&gt;*For brinkmanship to be effective, the sides continuously escalate their threats and actions. However, a threat is ineffective unless credibleat some point, an aggressive party may have to prove its commitment to action.*

The hedge funds have already begun demonstrating the "credibility" of their threat as early as Wednesday last week. They're trying very hard to give the appearance that they are prepared to nuke everything if the refs don't cancel the match.

To win, retail investors have to show they're completely prepared to hold to $0.

TL;DR   MONKE CRAZIER THAN YOU ARE

Title: Aussie trading platform Stake has restricted trading and I think thats good news for us
So today Stake (the platform
I use) restricted trade on $GME $AMC and $NOK which got me thinking why they would do that? Every answer I could think of just reinforced the diamond hands mindset.

1. They dont give a fuck about the small guy and their losses. Loss porn is literally a thing and that only proves that they arent protecting us, but their own positions. The only reason to protect yourself is if you are about to get hurt.

If someone is a about to punch you in the face but they are 2 blocks away you dont do shit. If they are within striking distance you do everything you can to protect yourself.

2. The reputational costs of doing this are astronomical, take RH for example who possibly fucked their IPO. The cost/benefit of this means that these costs of removing shares is lower than the cost of doing nothing and getting smashed by us.

3. I could only think of two reasons before my autism kicked in and I started licking a pole. 

Not financial advice. Position .18 of a share. Poor AF.

Edit: from the few comments I can see, Im not knocking Stake. I like their platform. I also know that it was not Stakes decision to stop trading as they made clear on their email. This post was more of analysis of why Drivewealth would tell Stake to stop customers from buying the stocks.

Title: 250% clearing partner charge for GME, AMC, and NOK by DTC
Stake is no longer letting us buy GME, AMC, or NOK because the DTC is requiring 250% of the value of these stocks.

This is not their decision. Their broker-dealer cannot pay the 250% charge for trading these stocks.

Read here: [https://hellostake.com/au/stake-updates/understanding-trading-suspensions/](https://hellostake.com/au/stake-updates/understanding-trading-suspensions/)

Snippet from article:

&gt;The clearing house requires the broker to front cash or capital guarantees to ensure funds are available through the settlement process.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The required amount of capital guarantee is usually around 10-15% of the value of a securitys holdings on brokers books.** However, this percentage can vary based on stock volatility. In the case of the above symbols, **the DTC has enforced an increase of 250% upon DriveWealths clearing partners.**  
&gt;  
&gt;DriveWealth have decided not to take on the large capital risk that comes with this significant increase. Well update you if this changes.  
&gt;  
&gt;This percentage of capital required to be held against a stock is a variable level that is stock specific. It is calculated through a value at risk model (more detail on the formula is available from page 57 [here](https://dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/policy-and-compliance/NSCC_Disclosure_Framework.pdf)). Most simply, its a function of the riskiness of a security  being gap risk, historical market volatility and trading volumes in individual stocks.  
&gt;  
&gt;As you can see in highly volatile markets, capital requirements rise. When paired with increased trade volumes as has recently been the case, many brokers have understandably not had the balance sheet flexibility to cater to the new requirements. **Highly volatile stocks such as GME and AMC currently carry a 100% cash collateral requirement.**

Title: SQUEEZE HAS NOT YET SQUOZE
Just compare a current one month chart in GME to a chart of the VW squeeze in 2008. VW short interest was 12.8% at the most. THERE IS STILL 120% SHORT INTEREST IN GME. They are still not buying. They are doing everything they can to manipulate and induce panic selling, so they can buy in to cover shorts as low as possible. THE FRENZY OF BUYING THAT IS COVERING SHORTS STILL HAS NOT HAPPENED. Hold strong and buy the dip. They are trying to ride out this movement and squash it with disinformation. Also, this is not financial advice, I am dumber than a second coat of paint. I just really like the stock.

Was mostly trying to point out the large dip JUST before massive squeeze. Apologies because I realize the chart I pasted kind of sucks, but google it for yourself because fuck you. Hopefully you realize that short positions eventually have to buy back the shares they borrowed. That is the real squeeze. I know that VW and GME are not the same situation, because I recognize GME is much more volatile and much more potential to squeeze higher. Lower float, higher short interest, legion of millions of retards, etc.

Title: For those wondering why BB QNX is so good
Information from Pixelcarve:

QNX is generally regarded among engineers as the most advanced, stable and secure operating system in the world. As such it is trusted by the likes of NASA for mission critical operations, large nuclear power stations, factories, high-speed train control systems, and an endless array of embedded systems that require 0% downtime. QNX has earned its reputation and many in the computer industry believe that if QNX had chosen to compete with Microsoft and Apple and pursue a consumer sales route rather than an enterprise route, the world of computing would be generations ahead of where it is now. 

So what makes it so great? QNX is built on a micro-kernel, which means that the core component of the OS (the kernel) only contains the bare minimum amount of code that can provide the mechanisms required to run an operating system. The remaining functions in a typical kernel (Monolithic OS) such as the filesystem, device drivers, application IPC, etc. are instead run outside of the kernel in the user space. Essentially what this means is that the kernel is the only software executing at the most privileged hardware level and is therefore infinitely more secure and stable. Bad drivers, software or executions cant bring it down.

Micro-kernels also allow for RTOS, which simply means an operating system with guaranteed consistency for how long it takes to accept and complete a task. For a real-life scenario, think about the ABS brakes on a car  they require mission critical specifications to occur in real-time or someone can die, so the system running them has to be able to guarantee the delivery, receipt and execution of messages in X amount of time or it does not qualify at RT.

The benefits of this architecture are too numerous to get into here, but one of the main benefit to RIM is its ability to execute multiple platform runtimes at the same time with high efficiency  this is why you can write an application in C/C++, Adobe AIR, Webworks HTML5, and Java and have them all run natively on BlackBerry 10. The benefit to developers and consumers here cannot be understated. Basically ANYONE with any amount of programming experience can make an app, from high-level web based UIs to low-level 3D games.

QNX takes their design one step further by also offering POSIX support, which is a family of IEEE standards that helps maintain OS and software compatibility. Being a full POSIX system, and not partly POSIX, ensures its a lot easier to develop software for the QNX platform.

Title: New strategy: flood the options market when the price is at its lowest.
So I just saw the post about how the $800 call options have over 5k contracts open. It made me realize that what these dudes have done was to force the clearing houses to hedge against the contracts by BUYING 100 SHARES FOR EACH CONTRACT. I know 800 strike and the timeline is probably expensive. But if the dumbo hedgies try to "scare" us off with artificially low prices, we can respond by buying options contracts way out of the money, which inadvertently is probably not way out of the money at all. This could start a gamma squeeze and we can probably generate the catalyst we need to push back against the hedge funds. Buying shares is a grind, and buying 100 of them at $325 is waaaaay more expensive than buying a single call option contract. Maybe we can use this to our advantage.

Title: Why AMC won't squeeze and other disappointing facts
I'm just going to get straight into it because there are too much bullshit surrounding this stock already. AMC is a solid sell at these prices, and I'll cover just some of the reasons.

\- Hedgies dumped millions of NEW shares onto market last week, in exchange for the debt of AMC they held:

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-silver-lake/silver-lake-cashes-out-on-amc-for-713-million-after-reddit-fueled-rally-idUSKBN29Z00E](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-silver-lake/silver-lake-cashes-out-on-amc-for-713-million-after-reddit-fueled-rally-idUSKBN29Z00E)

And they are thinking of dumping even more NEW shares, CRUSHING any hopes of a short squeeze, just last week **more than 44m shares were sold by Silver Lake, this is the same amount as THE ENTIRE NUMBER OF SHARES SOLD SHORT according to Ortex data as of 15th of Jan ( the most recent release) :**

[https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-considers-selling-more-stock-134513894.html](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-considers-selling-more-stock-134513894.html)

&amp;#x200B;

And **shareholders have been diluted in their positions by around 75%!** :

[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amc-entertainment-stock-now-a-sell-at-mkm-as-price-target-drops-to-1-11612196602](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amc-entertainment-stock-now-a-sell-at-mkm-as-price-target-drops-to-1-11612196602)

And more than **100m shares have/will/are in the process of being issued**, they a issuing shares like the FED are printing money:

[https://www.thestreet.com/investing/amc-entertainment-capital-raise](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/amc-entertainment-capital-raise)

&amp;#x200B;

**And most of this occurred AFTER the short interest report for Jan 15, which only showed a ABSOLUTELY pitiful 15.92% Short Interest, and only 1.21 days to cover, and cost to borrow being incredibly low - see the Ortex panel. I'd post a pic here from my account but I can't upload it at the moment. This was never high enough for a squeeze, now with all these new shares on the market or about to hit it you HONESTLY STILL THINK THERE WILL BE A SQUEEZE? STILL?** 

**SILVER has about the same chance now of squeezing as AMC!**

\----------

This is getting beyond a joke. The current price was clearly a result of baseless hype and people assuming it is still going to short squeeze. This is clearly all but a lie at this point. The company will trend back to it's fundamental value of around 2$ -$3 ( the broker consensus on IB) very quickly, as soon as people realize it's not going to squeeze anymore. This was what the price targets were when the company was talking about the real possibility of bankruptcy only about two weeks ago ( see SEC filings ). They won't go bankrupt now, at least in the near term, because they issued a shit ton of shares during the short mania, but this still leaves around 5.1 Billion in debt, and a company losing more than 100 million a month thanks to Covid.

If you are looking for a afterparty to join after GME, AMC definitely isn't it.

\---------

**TLDR:**

**Don't suck others into this failing short squeeze just because got sucked in by the hypetrain and want to sell the stock you bought at 17-20$ to some other poor bastard who knows even less than you do about short squeezes.**

Poistions:

Put spreads, such as  OTM bearish butterflys, verticals, and diagonals. Basically however I can get some negative deltas on this thing without paying to much in IV.

Title: Final Outcome Clarification
Hello Dysfunctional Tarzans,

Ok, so I can barely read as much as the next shit throwing monkey that roams these autistic lands and with that being said I was able to do a significant amount of DD in the form of reading every single WSB post in the past few weeks since this GME stuff really started to take off. So I am basically the smartest helmet. 

MY QUESTION : If over 100% of the GME shares where shorted by the Hedge Funds, and shorted shares being that they are borrowed and never actually paid for (yet) and then we have a bunch of retail investors that flood the market and pay cash for the GME shares so that we own the shares. This being the case, does that mean that every single retail investor has the opportunity to tell the Hedge Fund what price to pay for their share at? I mean if the Hedge Funds told the SEC that they own over 100% of the GME shares when retail investors actually own their shares. Then why are we not all of us setting our sell limit to 100k and no less. Forcing the Hedge Funds to pay that share price for every single GME share for every single investor that is selling.  

Like if I go on my account right now and set my sell limit to 100k right now, will the hedge fund eventually be absolutely 100% forced to pay that price no matter what? Like, they NEED my shares. The people who bought .5 shares of GME they don't just WANT  your half a share, they are in desperate NEED for that .5 share because they lied when they told the SEC how many shares they have so you could sell that half a share for 50k if you wanted to.

I know people have been saying that retail investors have the power right now. And is this how? Because we can set the price. Like an actual fixed price that they 100% have to pay no matter what. 

THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE. I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR. THE OTHER DAY I BURNED MY HAND AND TO COOL IT OFF I PUT MY HAND UNDER HOT WATER.

Title: Lakeland Industries NASDAQ: LAKE
Alright retards. Lakeland Industries. 10-15% short interest &amp; constantly abused by wannabe hedge funds. 

It's a small cap manufacturer of protective equipment and accessories for the industrial and public protective clothing market worldwide. The company has a robust balance sheet, and current trades at a \~4x expected fiscal year ended 2021 EBITDA on a fully diluted basis (which is a complete joke).  The valuation is dumb for two reasons: 1) a general misunderstanding by the market that this is purely a COVID-19 play; 2) the company has traditionally been known as sleepy and a poor allocator of capital, which, contrary to its valuation, is no longer the case. 

Driven by a new management team and a newly implemented ERP system, the companys recent financial performance has been outstanding since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Q3 revenues for the fiscal year 2021 came in at $41.5M, representing growth of 18% from Q3, and 50% from the prior years Q3 of fiscal 2020. Increased demand for its products, and significant improvements in gross margins, Lakeland has enabled Lakeland to generate cash from operations of $34.5 million over the last twelve months. As a result of this success, the companys balance sheet now features a total cash balance of $40.2 million, and no debt. Lakeland is one of the few producers of protective equipment to own its manufacturing facilities, which has enabled it to service customers globally far quicker than its larger competitors, who rely on contractors. An effective supply chain is an important differentiator in todays environment. 

The capital structure is clean. Lakeland only has one class of shares, the total share count is fairly low, and directors and shareholders own roughly 2.9% of the company. Stock options outstanding also are very low (only about 24,900 as at October 31, 2020). The company does repurchase shares from time to time, but has not done so during the current fiscal year. 

Judging by the low trading multiples, the market has clearly branded this exclusively as a COVID-19 PPE stock. This appears to be far from the truth. Lakeland estimates that approximately 35% of its revenue is driven by COVID-19 PPE requirements, and the remainder of its revenue is related to product segments not related to the pandemic. Lakeland is therefore uniquely positioned to benefit not only from the newly emerging industrial cleaning industry, but also from the economic recovery. Management has been mindful to not pivot its core business entirely from protective equipment for various industries (O&amp;G, fire safety, chemical) to servicing COVID-19 demand, so that it can continue to excel as the pandemic subsides. 

The big question for investors right now is what will Lakeland do with its glut of cash? The current management team is demonstrating a strong understanding of its cost structure, driven by its recent implementation of an ERP system.  Low margin SKUs have been culled, which has led to improved gross margins. The facilities in Vietnam and India are being expanded to meet the increased, and sustainable, demand in developing markets. On an annualized basis for the current fiscal year, Lakeland is currently clipping at a ROIC of 30%. Therefore Im a proponent for reinvestment, and expect management to pursue scaling this business up. Complemented by a renewed societal focus on protective equipment, and buoyed by continuous PP&amp;E stockpiling which is likely to sustain well into 2022, Lakeland is in a prime position to scale up its success and accelerate its already impressive growth trajectory. 

**Catalyst**

 Significant re-rate by the market once Lakeland sustains its impressive results as the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. A targeted EV/EBITDA multiple of \~13.0x is implied by comparable companies. That implies a TARGET PRICE OF $57, which will be easy to achieve and is backed by results. 

 Basically this thing will have no choice to rocket as it keeps ringing in stellar quarters.

Last Monday the volume was 176M. Right now, the volume is 20% of what it was a week ago. Don't be fooled by the ladder down scheme and other illegal shit the Hedge Funds and whoever else is on it is pulling. Something really illegal is going on, and yes, the squeeze is still on. With volume this low that means we are witnessing massive price manipulation.

Title: Great info on TWNK. I did not write this!! Just copied..
Long Thesis on Hostess Brands (TWNK) (Owner of Twinkies)

I posted this TWNK long thesis in r/stocks, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lafmq2/long_thesis_on_hostess_brands_twnk_owner_of/), but think it has a home in r/options as well given the 15% short interest, low IV, cheap options, and potential for gamma squeeze. Appreciate any and all thoughts.

# TL;DR

**Hostess Brands (TWNK)** has high (\~15%) short interest (more than AMC or BB) setting the stage for a short squeeze, additional upside from a gamma squeeze, is an iconic brand, AND has a fundamentally sound business with strong cash flows and organic growth trading at a reasonable valuation. ***Not intended to distract from HOLDING THE LINE ON GME. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade.***

# Intro

Sup guys. So I know a bunch of us are now looking for the next big opportunity to pile into. Unfortunately we probably wont see a squeeze of GMEs magnitude for awhile since that kind of short interest is insanely rare, but I think we might have found an opportunity that is pretty low hanging fruit AND is significantly better relative value than the other names people are piling into. It has what the finance community call asymmetric upside (more upside potential than downside risk), for the reasons Ill describe below.

**So whats the target?** ***Hostess Brands (NASDAQ: TWNK)***. You probably know them as the company that makes Twinkies, but they also make Cupcakes, DingDongs, HoHos, Donettes and Zingers (cant make this up)

For some historical context, the company was private-equity owned for awhile and then went public in 2016. The previous owners have fully sold out now, so the entire shares outstanding are pretty much public float today and theres no more downward pressure on the stock price from their share sales.

The company also has warrants from the their IPO (effectively long-dated call options) that trade under TWNKW. They trade as half warrants, so need two warrants to form one share and are ITM at $11.50 per one full share and expire in November 2021.

**So whats the thesis?** We think theres an opportunity to wring out the short sellers in this name and potentially even further upside from a gamma squeeze if we can get enough call option volume. From a fundamental standpoint, the business is extremely stable (as it was a pretty ideal candidate for an LBO), and trades at a slight discount to its peers.

# Technical Thesis

1. **High short interest = squeeze opportunity**  Roughly 15% short interest today, higher than AMC which is last reported at 10-15% (see end of post for reference) and BB at 5-10%. This seems low in comparison to GME, but again this company has no structural problems that were aware of (cant really say the same for movie theaters or mall-based retailers right now) and has actually been performing pretty well. Also, anything above 20% short interest is considered pretty high in the normal world. This level of short interest on a solid business smells like opportunity to squeeze out a couple of greedy hedge funds.
2. **Limited liquidity and trading volume will make it difficult for shorts to cover**  Average 3-month daily trading volume of 1.4mm shares (roughly 1% of the float). It would take about *13+ DAYS* for the shorts to fully cover if they were to buy up all the average daily trading volume. Current $2bn market cap is also in the perfect sweet spot for the retail pool of capital. If youre looking for a bit of diversification, this is the name.
3. **The potential for a Gamma squeeze is all further upside**  Theres actually been option activity picking up on this company. ***On Friday, Nasdaq reported that call options for 2.6mm of underlying shares traded hands on TWNK. This is with limited mention of TWNK online thus far (based on my keyword search through reddit)****.* See [this report](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-friday-option-activity%3A-twnk-wdc-nvcr-2021-01-29). Most of those options were sold OTM at the $17.50 strike price. Things are moving quick here and we might not be the only ones that have sniffed out this opportunity. In order to create the biggest upside, buying the highest strike call option is ideal. As the price moves closer to ITM on those options, the market makers will have to buy more shares to hedge. The IV is still really low on this name.

# Fundamental Thesis

1. **Snacking continues to be king.** Large market, resilient, growing. 95% of U.S. adults snack daily, and the average American snacks 3x-5x per day. The snacking category generates \~$150bn in annual sales and is expected to continue growing mid-single-digits driven by the need for convenience as consumers (at least pre-COVID-19) are busier than ever. Lots of room for multiple winners in the industry, of which I think Hostess will continue to be one.
2. **Strong organic growth story**. Organic sales have grown \~6% per year on average over the last number of years. Hostess Brands is growing  and likely gaining share.
3. **Strong brand value and nostalgia factor with millennials.** Some of you might be old enough to remember this but during 2012, when the company filed for bankruptcy (due to the heavy debt burden from its buyout), consumers freaked out that the company would discontinue production of their beloved Twinkies, triggering a mad scramble to buy up all available supply of Twinkies. ***At the peak Twinkies sold on Ebay for $22,000 (see article*** [***here***](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/11/on-ebay-the-starting-bid-for-a-single-twinkie-is-now-5-000/265346/)***).***
4. **The acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 rides the healthy snack trend.** Voortman sells crme wafers and sugar free cookies (new product categories for Hostess), and markets as having no artificial colors, no artificial flavors, no high-fructose corn syrup, and no trans-fat (playing the better-for-you snack trend). Voortman is one of the fastest growing independent sweet snacking brands of scale in North America, and should be able to accelerate growth by leveraging Hostess existing distribution footprint.
5. **COVID-19 re-opening should drive a bounce-back in convenience store traffic, which is the companys primary sales channel and may also increase demand as consumers become busy again (and thus snack more).** Management plans to keep growing within the convenience store channel, which is a growing end-market and should rebound as the world re-opens. As consumers get back to their busy pre-COVID-19 lives, they may also go back to snacking more out of convenience.

# Potential Risks

1. **Changing consumer preferences, especially to healthy.** The recent acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 allows Hostess to further capitalize on the healthy trend.
2. **Pretty high leverage for a public company.** They have roughly $950mm of net debt, or \~4x leverage on Adj. EBITDA (Adj. EBITDA is a proxy for cash flow). This is pretty high leverage for a public company (but quite low in private equity land). Leverage increased to \~4.5x in the beginning of 2020 after the acquisition of Voortman Cookies (up from \~3.4x before the acquisition), but has steadily declined to \~4x today as Adj. EBITDA has grown. Given their cash flow profile, would not be surprised to see them continue to deleverage.
3. **Customer concentration.** The Companys largest customer is Walmart, which was \~24% of sales. Top ten customers accounted for \~62% of sales in 2019. Some risk with customer concentration, but Hostess Brands is such a well-known and entrenched brand that I dont think retail stores will do anything irrational.
4. **Rebound of COVID-19.** Risk that COVID-19 cases rise again, possibly hurting traffic and sales through retail stores, increasing costs, or causing supply chain disruptions. On the flip side, the snack category seems to have held steady from consumers staying at home and snacking more.

# Conclusion

If youre looking for a little diversification or finding the next oversold stock, look no further. This stacks up as a much better opportunity than AMC or BB given the higher short interest and more stable business fundamentals. Also, we can also potentially create even more upside with a gamma squeeze if we are able to buy more call options at the high strike prices.

***Again, this is not intended to distract from other holdings you may have. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade (and hopefully does not require much capital). Bringing this to your attention now before it starts to trade away from us or before the hedge funds exit their shorts. More than happy to hear any feedback from you guys.***

Title: BB - QNX Microkernel Cybersecurity Bull Case
Hello Friends,

TL;DR -  BB Blackberry has an architecturally secure embedded operating system compared to competitors, safety and security are important for electric vehicles, military use, and future IoT devices, I am holding 2000 shares of blackberry and suggest you buy to hold for longterm gains.  

I'm a cybersecurity sector employee. I have previously brought you detailed analysis surrounding the capabilities of [Palantir](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l07ly5/dd_pltr_foundry_explanation_from_reformed_data/), [FireEye](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laki1v/feye_playing_tomorrows_fireeye_q4_earnings_based/) (check comments), and other cybersecurity vendors here in WSB. I have also written a [guide to understanding how propaganda and misinformation campaigns are being used to manipulate retail investors](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l928lr/obfuscation_misinformation_propaganda_and_gme/) and what you can do to help yourself.

Anyway, moving past establishing credibility, here is my analysis on why I am bullish about the security posture surrounding the Blackberry QNX operating system in comparison to other competitors in the embedded RTOS environment.

# What is RTOS

RTOS is Real-Time Operating System. Most operating systems do not need to perform tasks within predictable computation timeframes, as we tend not to notice any performance difference. This is why it takes either 7 minutes or 11 lifetimes to download Winrar. With an RTOS, the primary applications are time-sensitive or mission-critical operating systems. These include power plants, water treatment facilities, dams, vehicles, drones, and further applications. If your system does not operate in a predictable fashion within set timeframes and capacities, you cannot rely on it for ensuring your dam doesn't overflow, your autonomous vehicles does not crash, or your drone can stay afloat in the air.

# Start with Monolithic OS

Most RTOS are monolithic as far as their OS architecture goes. Generally, systems are built into Kernel and User land. A monolith tends to control all system management within Kernel-land with user applications running in Userland. The issue with this approach is reliability. Any individual failure can potentially crash the OS, which is an unacceptable condition for many of the above applications.

In addition, trying to modify the monolithic OS is difficult to do without a complete shutdown. Shutting down a drone or train mid-journey is not feasible. For cybersecurity purposes, the attack surface is enormous as any individual part of the system (including applications) can affect the reliability of the OS.

Good news is that they're more performant though!

# MicroKernel

QNX is a MicroKernel architecture. The MicroKernel only does process isolation / memory management / task switching. All other standard OS operations (file system, drivers, networking, etc) are performed in UserLand instead.

This architecture is useful because it means that:

* Individual component failures will not compromise the entire OS. So for drones, a bug in a camera application or in the network traffic will not affect the flight of the drone. This is pertinent in the context of power plants, dams, military equipment, and autonomous/electric vehicles.
* When a component fails, it is easy to detect the point of failure. Monolithic kernels are difficult to trace faults in, especially as services get coupled together.
* Live restoration, if a component fails it can be restored without taking the system offline.
* Isolation, processes do not share memory or processing space, preventing many classes of memory manipulation bugs / security flaws such as buffer overflows, use after free, etc.
* Systems can be built to scale or share workload across multiple Userland apps, potentially preventing the crash entirely at the cost of degraded performance.

So look, the architecture of the QNX system puts it in a great position compared to other monolithic kernels in the embedded OS space.

# Key QNX benefits

Memory Protection - Typically, an OS assigns a block of memory to a process for it to store either data or instructions. QNX assigns a process a block of virtual memory, that is then mapped to physical memory with spatial separation between each block. This means that you cannot reliably change the operation of the program or read the data effectively when given physical access. Sure, ASLR, Canaries, and the Guard space do exist in modern OS's, but in embedded space memory is much tighter so this is a key benefit!

CPU Scheduling - CPU's use a variety of scheduling algorithms to give processes different weights for execution. This can become problematic when critical processes end up being stalled because low priority processes are hogging CPU time due to bugs or manipulation (such as regex backtracking for validation). QNX uses adaptive partioning which basically enforces that each application is partitioned to have a predetermined set of resources such as memory, filespace, or cpu time. This makes it difficult to starve any particular critical process of resources.

Safety &amp; Compliance - The OS has pre-configured designs ready for compliance with EC 61508 (industrial), IEC 61511, EN 50128 (rail), IEC 62304 (medical) or ISO 26262 (automotive) industry standards. These are rigorous engineering standards that are designed to enforce strict safety measures, monitoring for faults, and procedures for operating. Compliance with any of these is a long and arduous process, which BB has been working on for a long time. Other embedded system vendors have not met these standards yet, or have only chosen to focus on their key industries.

Security - Normal Standards like secure boot, integrity validation of all programs prior to execution, address space validation, application isolation and sandboxing, data and network and inter-process access control, and execution of everything from userland (no root) are all other benefits I don't have time to get too deep into.

This is a good blogpost that details how the microkernel is able to quickly identify deviations from the standard, apply logging, and pinpoint where to analyze further for performance or security remediation.

[https://devblog.blackberry.com/en/2020/04/securing-the-clipboard](https://devblog.blackberry.com/en/2020/04/securing-the-clipboard)

This was in response to an iOS update that showed when applications were accessing a users clipboard. Tiktok and facebook were accessing the clipboard p. much every second. Conspiracy theorists would say that Tiktok was harvesting user clipboard data hoping for PII or credentials. Regardless, BB was prepared for this attack vector already as demonstrated by this quick blog post as a response.

Building their own competitor to TLS, the standard for secure web communication. The web's based off of a Request/Response model, but BB allows for PubSub, Voice, and Video amongst other secure data transmission methods. Looking into their encryption algorithm support, Argon2 stands out as it is a relatively recent (with low uptake) hashing algorithm.

# Summary

Overall, hope this gives you some confidence that BB are market leaders in the embedded OS space, as the microkernel architecture does set them apart when compared to competitors in the business, and their existing big enterprise relationships and 100% certification and compliance to safety/security standards should get them into many new critical infrastructure, military, drone, and electric vehicle embedded systems.

2000 shares BB @ 12.00

Title: IMPORTANT MATH LESSON FOR THE PAPER HANDS - RETAIL OWNS THE $GME FLOAT
math time...

The float is only 50.65M shares.

There's 8.1M WSB degenerates.

Let's throw out some scenarios to show how we (just the WSB degenerates), not even counting the rest of retail, could in fact own 100% of the float -

1. Every degenerate owns GME (yes I know that's not at all realistic) -50.65M / 8.1M = 6.33 shares/degenerate
2. If only 50% of the degenerates own GME -50.65M / .50(8.1M) = 12.51 shares/each
3. If only 25% of the degenerates own GME -50.65M / .25(8.1M) = 25.01 shares/each
4. If only 10% of the degenerates own GME -50.65M / .10(8.1M) = 62.53 shares/each

Let that sink in. Yes I know a lot of you have much more than than 62.53 shares, and a lot have only 1 or 2 shares (or even a fraction of a share).

This doesn't take into account all of the retail that is not even on WSB that owns GME.

This doesn't take into account all of the shares Cohen and others have bought up.

Bottom line, we, retail, degenerates, autists, &amp; retards, likely own nearly ALL OF THE FLOAT.

Hedge funds bought up the rest, holding it to squeeze their fellow assholes along with us.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR SUMMARY : BUY + HOLD = TENDIES.   $GME

(and if my math is wrong, what did you expect?? I'm retarded)

Edit: I added to my $GME long position AH on the dip. Also, this is not advice (unless you like retarded advice.)

Title: Why the S3 Short Interest Data May Be Accurate (But is answering the wrong question)
Disclaimer: Do not listen to me, not a financial professional, I can't tell if I'm paranoid and retarded or have some brain wrinkles anymore. This is not financial advice, blah blah blah, suck my dick SEC.

&amp;#x200B;

Simply put, the S3 Short Interest data is probably fairly accurate. But it's not answering the relevant question.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone with any statistical background knows that asking the right question is as important as any analysis you do.

&amp;#x200B;

For short interest there are two relevant questions:

1. What is the net exposure to a short in a hedge fund's portfolio?
2. How many shares still have yet to be bought that must be bought in order to cover?

&amp;#x200B;

It is my belief that S3's data is answering the first question but not the second.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately there has been a significant increase in volume for super OTM puts and super OTM calls. Selling a put is a bullish position and buying a call is a bullish position. However, the shares associated with these positions ARE NOT NECESSARILY PURCHASED YET. This is particularly true for selling a naked put.

&amp;#x200B;

My thought is that hedge funds have begun selling a FUCK TON of otm naked puts. This creates some revenue for them and also, on paper, effectively closest their exposure to a short position. So, if you're short 100 shares and you sell a put (taking on the obligation to buy 100 shares at a certain, low, price, if the contract is exercised) you are effectively hedged. Thus as long as that contract is open, it may appear to S3's algorithms that the position is closed.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem arises because those 100 shares linked to the sold put ARE NOT purchased yet if the hedge funds are selling naked puts. They are just floating about. So while the net exposure to short positions is reduced, the need to buy shares has not been alleviated.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps the squeeze has been squoze. Perhaps not.

&amp;#x200B;

I would appreciate any feedback that people have. I'm trying to determine for myself how plausible this is. Maybe I've got some brain wrinkles. Maybe I'm completely braindead. idk. lmk.

Title: REMEMBER GME Insiders Cannot Sell due to pre-earnings Blackout Period
I'm echoing a post from 7 days ago that pointed out that insiders (board members, large individual shareholders) CANNOT SELL until the earnings report.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4hnrh/gme_insider_quiet_period_ie_insiders_cant_sell/

This means daddy cohen with 14+% of the company and the rest of the Boomer board that own cumulatively like 25+% of the stock CANNOT SELL AND ARE DEFACTO DIAMOND HANDS.

Here's a link to one source for large holdings:
https://news.gamestop.com/stock-information/institutional-ownership

RC Ventures, Donlad Foss, George Sherman are all board members and you can bet your ass that Blackrock, Vanguard, Fidelity and others aint gonna sell. Fuck, the country of Norway owns 2.8% of the damn stock (Statens Pensjonsfond Utland). 

Earnings is March 25 post-market. 

This is not investment advice, make your own decisions. I own some shares of gamestop.

Title: THinK..... lol GME
If you have ever seen something up 1000+ % fall then you know it does not just slowly dry up ....

it dumps and dumps hard

If today was a dump then we would be under $150 for sure with better volume!

and the halt down today ... come on ... that made me laugh so hard to see it pop right back up after it re opened. Had to be the silliest halt down i have EVER seen

holding and buying if they push it over then oh well but thing(s) like this do not happen often and this is different

no advice given im just stupid and know nothing

Title: These assholes are committing conspiracy and fraud in the open market. Its time we start playing the same games. Set a buy order for 1 share of $GME tomorrow for $4200.69 and watch the fireworks begin
[deleted]

Title: Can we for once, objectively talk about the pros and cons of this theory that the hedge funds are manipulating the price action? NO mods, I dont have a meme for you, its called DD.
Listen, sheeple... On the one hand we have people that believe the retail investors (thats you, retard), are buying and/or holding. The volume indicators seem to show that this is true for the most part, but Im too fucking stupid and/or skeptical to be convinced. How the fuck do you know JPM for example hasnt started dumping their massive holdings in GME? 

On the other hand, we have all these conspiracy theories that that the hedges are manipulating the price by various means such as laddering (creating false downside volume by essentially trading between themselves rapidly in a coordinated effort). One of the things that bothers me about this theory is that Ive yet to see anyone come here and convincingly explain how this works to the downside or if its complete bullshit.

IF we are all buying like we sure as fuck say we are , then HOW is the stock price moving down. Is it really manipulation or is that just what we want to believe? I dont know about you, but Im not into self-reenforcing theories and bullshit.

Is the stock moving down because you people are scared little bitches?

Is the stock moving down because its being manipulated, and if so, HOW?

Is the stock moving down because of legitimate institutional unloading?

Somebody please ELI5 because most the idiots in here are flying completely blind and  a mass exodus will be inevitable unless the quality of the information around here starts to improve beyond emoji and memes. Please stop being sheep and start asking legitimate questions or you stand to lose everything.

Title: For those of you that dont know why price dropped today, read this. $GME $AMC
I know it's scary with money on the line, but the last thing you want to cloud your judgement and trading is emotion. Check out this tweet. He explains a sell ladder with great clarity. If we hold and buy the dips, price will regain as demand steps back in. Keep those  strong. This week is going to have a lot of this happening.

I love this stonk!

Title: $GME is a time bomb and it's highlighting a severe vulnerability in the financial system.
### Disclaimer: 
I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I barely understand how the stock market works. Professionally I'm a network security researcher -- my job is to find and explain vulnerabilities in other complicated systems that my smooth brain barely understands. 

---------

Guess what you fucking idiot -- you aren't allowed to collapse the entire financial market in less than a week using a phone app. It takes more time.

---------

# There are likely several million new synthetic longs of $GME, diluting the market, that were created on 01/28/21.

They were created by a market maker (or possibly several market makers) to stop the beginning of a short squeeze that would have bankrupted hedge funds if a margin call hit them, which ultimately could have financially impacted those market makers once liability for the shares was transferred. These shares weren't borrowed from anyone. They're imaginary. Pure fiction. A promise only a handful of entities can make.

The reason they did this was to buy time to save their own asses. [The reason they were allowed to do this is because regulations let them](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html).

The creators of those shares have 21 days to deliver. Until then, they aren't paying interest. There isn't a public record of their creation -- the closest insight we have to the number of synthetic longs in existence for $GME are the [failure-to-deliver numbers](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/), and $GME is a major outlier in that field. A fucking terrifying outlier.

We aren't bleeding out a hedge fund by holding. Melvin very likely *is* out of their position after losing half of their fund. There aren't 'new shorts replacing the old'. Instead, a buffer of imaginary stock was created by a market maker to 'flatten the curve' when a massive number of shorts had to cover once retail buyers started rushing in.

---------

# That's why you aren't seeing short interest increase even though there aren't any short shares left to borrow.

**These assholes are praying that in the next month, retail buyers get scared, bored, or distracted.** They're spreading FUD, attacking with short ladders, hoping you watch the short interest drop and think it's over. They're counting on you to sell your $GME at a bargain rate so you can pay rent, because they think *you're just fucking retail scum betting on a shit company,* and they've been playing this game longer than you've been alive.

They're also counting on you to obsess over things you can measure that they can hide. They want you to set rules and limits on when you're going to run away.

---------

# Simultaneous to the creation of these synthetic longs, DTCC increased collateral requirements on 01/28/21 to purchase $GME to 100%.

This led smaller brokers like Robinhood to restrict trading, depressing the price, conveniently making it less expensive for market makers to recover their synthetic longs. 

**The people that pushed this collateral increase knew exactly what would happen**, because *it's their job* to know what the impact will be when they make changes like this.

DTCC openly stated they increased collateral requirements for $GME to reduce risk to their organization. **DTCC recognized financial liability in this squeeze could eventually reach clearinghouses if the market makers went bankrupt.** They know exactly what the failure-to-deliver numbers mean for this security. 

It's possible that DTCC created new collateral requirements in coordination with the flood of synthetic longs explicitly to make it easier to recover those shares. It is also possible these actions were taken without any coordination with market makers, because DTCC knows it could have dampened and stretched out a squeeze through this act alone.

**Their strategy is to stretch out a short squeeze into a 'long high' they can recover from if retail shares are sold over time, since retail can't buy them back.**

And the people working at DTCC likely rationalized this was 'the right thing to do' -- to prevent a systemic failure that could have impacted the entire stock market -- because preventing systemic failures is the only reason organizations like DTCC exist.

Meanwhile, Robinhood -- the smallest player in the game -- honestly DTCC's buttboy in this scheme -- is going to be grilled by Congress over this shit.

---------

# Did you think we were the only ones that saw a black swan event coming when we bought shares?

The root problem is there are several players in the market capable of creating new shares without paying interest, capable of restricting trading -- and they all face severe financial liabilities if a squeeze happens. They want to turn the squeeze into a slow burn so the damage doesn't hit them.

If we continue to hold, a squeeze could happen sometime around or after Feb 18th, or another market maker could create *even more* synthetic longs to dilute the market, passing the hot potato. This could make their problem even worse once *those shares* are bought and held.

This could continue for an extremely long period of time until a financial regulator steps in and forces them to buy the shares they've sold.

---------

**TL;DR**: 

WSB is being made into a fall guy for the collapse of the market due to the creation of a massive number of preexisting synthetic longs that were bought and held. To fix it, market makers decided to make more, but their cure is also a poison they can't stop taking.

**Strategy**: 

Hold your positions, buy at any price you can afford to hold forever, and hope that retail owns more shares than the total number that exist for $GME. Contact the SEC and ask them to investigate and to halt trading of $GME -- time is on your side if the clock ticks down the deadlines for market makers, while the stock cannot be sold by paper hands.

**Postitions**:

100 $GME  -- but only holding for $10,000/share -- I'm not so greedy that I want the entire market to collapse.

Title: DD BYND Belief, has anyone had a McPlant?
# Mcdonalds recently announced the development and test of a meatless burger, similar to those like BYND and Impossible. They began launching the "McPlant" in Denmark and Sweden this month.

A friend of mine discovered the ingredients list of the McPant, Mcdonalds big new plant based burger. He cross examained it agianst the BYND meat burger, note...Mcdonalds and BYND have yet to anounce any partnerships on their McPlant Burger. After futher examination and many hours of labor he established the first ever "Meatless Meat Comparison Chart" or MMCC.

As you can see from the results, he found that there is a 87.5% match in raw ingredients which emcompasses both the Beyond Burger and McPlant Burger. This essentially means there's a partnership with McDonalds and Beyond which is yet to be announced or discovered. The proposed theory is Beyond Meat will be supplying all of the McPlant Burgers in a massive deal.

Feel free to do what ever you want with this information. Shout out to my friend doing all the DD, totally not financial advice in any way.

2020 revenue - 1.4 Trillion (yes trillion). the revenue is up 30% from 2019 (yes during a pandemic). 
Earnings- 530billion.  

This means that they are trading at 1:1 P/E ratio. 

Compare that to AMD (106bil market cap - 2.5billion earnings - 38 P/E and NVDA 321marketcap - 2.8bil earnings - 140 P/E.
Intel has market cap of $230bil - $20bil earnings - 11 p/E

So shouldnt TSM have a market cap of at least 5 trillion?? How is no one talking about the fact that their revenue during a pandemic is 1.4 trillion with profit margin of 40%??? 

I think there are some seriously sweet tendies to be made. The IV is pretty low and you can get 2022 calls with a 200 strike for $5. Or a 2023 call with 200strike for $12. 

Someone please explain how this is possible and what I am missing. This is a no brainer. 

Also, for the first time ever, TSM will be building a plant in the USA

EDIT: thank you for pointing out that my numbers were in TWN not USD.  I effed up.  Still a great company.

Title: Why eBay is going to roll on their earnings
By roll on, I mean knock out of the fucking park.


Heres some DD for anybody who doesnt eat breath and sleep only GME.


eBay, like most other online retailers, are going to have ludicrous numbers in this last quarter due to the holiday season. Thats just a given. 


I am an experienced eBay seller who on a weekly basis for the last few years, sells around 15-20 items. The last few months was ridiculous. Items which were posted that would have around 10 bids and 5-15 watchers, would have 25-30 with 20+ bids. The views on each item was double to tripe from early November until pretty much the last two weeks. 


Lots of volume, lots of selling, lots of 10% commissions for eBay. Now we all saw what happened with Apple, posting 100+ Billion in revenue this last earnings report and being down 3% the next day. That shit happens, Im not a psychic with a magic ball. If the market is tanking, the market is tanking. Look at it this week. But I will say this, the volume on eBay isnt why Im going fucking hard in the calls. Heres the real cherry on top:

eBay has now finally implemented a payment policy they have been working on for a long time. Every single one of my sales went through PayPal, along with everybody else. Every single god damn transaction PayPal got their dirty little claws into. Since I think like the beginning of eBay, its just been a given that they give PayPal millions of dollars every month to run their transactions.


Well guess what you mother fucker. Shit had changed. Since they have now implemented their STRAIGHT TO BANK ACCOUNT POLICY, PayPal doesnt even exist. The money goes, you guessed it, straight to your account. They even have their own return feature which they deal with themselves now, instead of putting funds into hold on PayPal. eBay allows you to chose when you get paid and in what frequency. For example, I have mine setup for each Tuesday of every week. 

This is going to and has already saved them MILLIONS in fees. Papa Musk has already moved on from PayPal, its time we do the same.


Oh, did I mention all the new payment platforms introduced as well? I bought a Pokmon card the other day without gay as shit PayPal but through god damn Apple Pay. It was way too easy. You can also link credit cards, bank accounts, whatever. Its 2021.


eBay posts earnings in a few days, Wednesday after close. Do what you want. If the stock goes down, call me a retard and make fun of me. If the stock goes up, fuck off and thank me later. Look at what it did today. Ill probably sell a third of my calls on Wednesday for an IV hedge as well. Play at your own risk. 


TLDR; My positions are eBay CALL 05/FEB/21 60CALL , 62CALL and 65CALL

Title: We're all screwed.
Guys it's over. Someone has to speak truth. The squeeze is over. Short interest is way down. S3 has real time info. All the other data people are throwing around is dated. Updated filings will be tomorrow. When they show short interest is way down everyone will be heaeing for the door. All yall who bought in the last week, youre the bag holders. Sorry people. Its a rout and then a slow drain towards a normal valuation. 

And for those or you who claim Im a shill for the hedge funds, Ive been here a long time. I was diamond hands with the rest of the retards shorting spy in March...all the way through June. People on this board will talk you into diamond hands all the way to the poorhouse.

Title: BCRX -- A Group of Longs From StockTwits Make Their Case
 yes yes, BCRX is a really weird way to spell GME/AMC/BB etc.  Moving right along....

**The Shorts - The Side Show**

Lets be honest, the real reason anyone is in WSB right now is to fist shorts. BCRX, however, is also a company that needs to gap up to reach fair value.  Fist the shorts and hold the gains.

Biocryst has a high and steadily growing institutional ownership [currently reported at 71%](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bcrx/institutional-holdings). Biocryst has a float of 175m (124m of which are held by institutions), who are buying every share they can and not likely to sell any time soon.  This leaves 56m tradable shares. [The shorts have 30m shares or 70% of the tradable float.](http://nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=ShortInterest) This is not as big as the $GME naked short taken on by u/DeepFuckingValue. But, we think this is a stock that if it gaps up can hold the gain based on value. Institutions run an algorithm almost every day and short the stock (check the charts). We can make these fuckers squirm with the slightest effort.

**Orladeyo - The Prelude**

Orladeyo has recently been approved in the [US](https://biopharmajournal.com/2020/12/07/biocryst-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaqbcrx-receives-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-in-preventing-hae-attacks/) and [Japan](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/biocryst-bcrx-wins-japanese-approval-for-hae-drug-orladeyo-2021-01-25) to treat Hereditary Angioedema(European approval expected shortly). HAE is a rare disease that affects roughly 1/50,000 people, or about \~25,000 people in the three regions mentioned previously.

Orladeyo treats a rare disease and that means the medication is expensive. It costs [$485,000/year in the US](https://endpts.com/biocryst-wins-approval-for-hae-pill-and-charges-half-a-million-dollars-but-will-anyone-take-it/#:~:text=Six%20years%20after%20the%20FDA,BioCryst%20has%20notched%20another%20approval.&amp;text=Despite%20inferior%20efficacy%2C%20BioCryst%20will,had%20projected%20a%20%24300%2C000%20tag.) and will roughly cost half of that in Japan and the EU. The company has projected they will capture 40% of the market [(page 15)](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/bcd71bf3-ef71-4803-81c4-edd4e33ebb38).  Capturing 40% of the market is a share price of [$70 when trading at a reasonable (if not conservative) 7x revenue multiple.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tLvclUzTqCitwKfawL7kGCLquJxA2T7IJKLg52VWotE/edit?usp=sharing) Work your own numbers and youll find SP should be more than $9 and the current market cap of 1.6 billion. FDA approval of Orladeyo enabled BioCryst to cross a bridge from a small unprofitable research company to expanding [commercial biotech](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4393550-biocryst-time-to-switch-hats-mid-cap-fits-now-maybe-large-cap) now engaged in execution.

**Factor D -  The Main Event**

Factor D is the blockbuster.  Full stop.  The company is already pursuing PNH but has indicated their intended subsequent targets for this drug. Theyre small targets like Lupus and IGA Nephropathy along with[ 6 others (page 24)](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/41ee0771-0acc-479e-a39e-2842101c6aa9) and its already being hailed as [best in class](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3087617&amp;headline=BCRX-BioCryst-has-potential-bestinclass-PNH-treatment-says-JMP-Securities)

So whats this look like money wise?  Alexions drugs SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS are the current treatment for PNH those [make up 4.3B of their 5B revenues.](https://ir.alexion.com/node/22191/pdf)  AstraZeneca just bought them out for a whopping 39B.  If Factor D receives same valuation, that alone puts SP at $222 given our float.  [The sky is truly the limit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tLvclUzTqCitwKfawL7kGCLquJxA2T7IJKLg52VWotE/edit?usp=sharing) over the next 24-48 months.  The point is, the company is ready to gap up on merit, but is being held back by high short activity.

**Galidesivir - The Wild Card**

If you arent already excited, maybe youll be excited by a drug [that provides 90% protection against Ebola](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320203179_Efficacy_of_Galidesivir_against_Ebola_Virus_Disease_in_Rhesus_Monkeys) when dosed 72 hours post exposure. Huge Ebola outbreak? BioTerror attack in a major city?  Think humanity might end in a pandemic more lethal than covid with people hemorrhaging blood from their eyes? No problem. Just distribute the [galidesivir](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/galidesivir) and most everyone will be protected. (Animal studies suggest high protection against [Zika](https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/4/suppl_1/S55/4294108), Yellow Fever, Marburg, [Tick Borne Encephalitis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31142664/) and others). 

Why didnt we already have this drug?  Thats anyones guess, but politics seems to have something to do with it.  No one can yet determine the value or ultimate use of galidesivir as it is tied up in government development contracts. The company has already [stated](https://ir.biocryst.com/events/event-details/biocryst-third-quarter-2020-conference-call) that it is developing galidesivir for government contracts and shareholders seem to have little to do with this. So, well just call this the sleeping wild card.

**FOP- The Feel Good Drug**

This is not a money maker. But, in case you havent found a soft spot for this company, they appear close to a first time cure for an extremely rare disease called [FOP](https://www.biocryst.com/our-pipeline/fop-program/). It slowly (and painfully) cripples children when their joints fuse together with excess bone. Children affected by FOP often end up wheelchair bound by age 11. Cant tell you this drug will be a money maker as the affected population is too small. But, gosh, dont you want the company to succeed?

**The Competition - The Class Clowns**

Disease:  Hereditary Angioedema (HAE)

For the prophylactic (preventative) market, the competitors are Cinryze, Takhzyro (from Takeda) which are IVF and subcutaneous injections respectively. Haegarda (CSL Behring) has a subcutaneous injection as well. Orladeyo recently received [FDA approval](https://biopharmajournal.com/2020/12/07/biocryst-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaqbcrx-receives-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-in-preventing-hae-attacks/) to be the first and only oral prophylactic treatment for HAE.

The patents of the competitors expire in 2032 and no generics are expected on the market before 2032. Orladeyo was granted extended patent protection until [2037](https://ir.biocryst.com/news-releases/news-release-details/new-composition-matter-patent-allowance-extends-protection). [Royalty Pharma](https://www.royaltypharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/royalty-pharma-acquires-royalty-interest-orladeyo-and-bcx9930) did a deep dive on BioCrysts expected Orladeyo revenues when it agreed to royalty financing that enabled BCRX to fast track Factor D development and expand it to 8 clinical indications.  

Disease: Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) 

Alexion holds the sole drug Soliris and its spin off Ultomiris (both IVF C5 inhibitors) to treat the rare blood disorder PNH. Alexion has market exclusivity until 2025 for Soliris. [This activist letter ](http://www.elliottletters.com/alexion.pdf)and [this article](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/alexion-moves-from-cfo-clancy-and-his-legendary-caution-does-mean-more-m-a-coming) highlight that analysts believe the 39B purchase of Alexion was a fire sale due to mismanagement. If Factor D received at least the same discounted valuation as ALXN, that would mean its market cap would increase from 1.6B to 39B. Excited?

Factor D is expected not just to be equivalent to Soliris, but exceed it. BioCryst Medical Director Bill Sheridan believes Factor D will make competitors [obsolete](https://ir.biocryst.com/events/event-details/39th-annual-jp-morgan-healthcare-conference) as it cures patients earlier in the disease process than C5 and C3 inhibitors. Unlike competitors, Factor D will also be both an oral pill \*and\* a monotherapy. In other words, theres not much competition. Also, PNH is only the first of 8 serious illnesses expected to be treated by Factor D.

**The Insiders**

Still not convinced? CFO Anthony Doyle joined BioCryst April 02, 2020. Four months after joining the company he used $220,320 of his own money to [purchase shares in BioCryst ATM.](https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1808688.htm) As he is mortal like the rest of us, we assume CFO Anthony Doyle also pays taxes. Therefore, it appears as if he put the entirety of his after tax salary, for a whole year, into aligning himself with shareholders. Famed biotech investor Alex Denner has also been accumulating a passive position, ATM, right next to retail, [as recently as a couple weeks ago](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-bcrx-biocryst-pharmaceuticals-sarissa-capital-management-lp-sc-13g-2021-january-25-18652).

Title: $BB DD - NO MEEMS - PART 2
TOday I did research to calm myself down after pounding a redbull and getting triggered by all the misinformation and greedy nitwits that have flooded this site looking for a quick flip.

Imagine youre John Chen. Sauntering down the hallway, with your 50 pound dick grazing the velveteen carpet with each step. You hear the guttural screams coming out of sales. You walk by the engineers, and gaze upon the latest widget as they kowtow before your bespecled grandeur. You hear about the customers who sing your praises, and the (much fewer) ones who tell you your product sucks donkey balls... But we (the retards @ WSB or frankly the dubmasses @ seeking alpha and even JP Morgan equity coverage) dont know the details any of this, only dry ass reports that come out every quarter.

So, other than hacking into Johns brain (not recommended), what can we do? We can suckle at the teat of Twitter announcements, and sometimes thats fun but usually its PR driven (unless it comes from Papa Chens account in which case suckle away).

But boy oh boy wouldnt it be great if we could know the things P. Chiddy does. What new things are in development. Big new sales in the pipeline. Whether the company is hiring (or shrinking), and in what areas.Wait. For the last thing we actually can!

thanks to the grotesquely fat (and very rich, no offense Gabe) founder of a soul-crushing professional network called LinkedIn. Linkedin, very kindly, takes employment related info from companies and displays it for all the world including competitors of those companies and bored autists like me. So lets see - What Can headcount trends @ $BB tell us about the company?

To start, I took a look at Job Postings / Total Headcount. If youre a shrinking company, this should be a low number. If youre growing, it stands to reason this % would be higher. No company deliberately hires people they dont think they need, and last time I checked $BBs CFO wasnt completely retarded. Now, its important not to read too much into this, but as a general matter companies that are growing have high stock prices (b/c theyre growing, duh) and vice versa.

FANG isnt a perfect comp (Ill get to the others in a sec), but **serves as a good proxy of a baseline growthy tech.** No super saiyan rocketships at this point, but nobody is accusing $AAPL of shrinking. See below.

# IMPLICATION NUMBER #1 - $$BB COMPARES FAVORABLY TO FANG IN TERMS OF HEADCOUNT-IMPLIED GROWTH. IF YOU SAID $BB IS HIRING MORE RELATIVE TO ITS SIZE THAN THE AVERAGE FANG, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AND THROW BANANAS AT YOU, BUT YOUD BE RIGHT!!

But wait, you say. growthinvestor123 you fucking idiot, [didnt you just compare $BB to CRWD, ZS, SAIL, and PANW](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/) to justify a **$60 / share** price target for $BB? I want to see the ratios for those. Ok you, got me. See below, headcount-implied growth is higher for endpoint security comparables.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eaz3begzize61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d01221903b3c50a6838710f32daa173035eb9e92

Hah, you say smugly. Those other endpoint security businesses blow $BB out of the water, $BB sucks.

No, you fucking idiot. If a simple headcount ratio without context was all it took Id be rich instead of handsome like mommy tells me.

$BB went through [**round**](https://channeldailynews.com/news/layoffs-hit-blackberry-in-waterloo/28015) after [**round**](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=blackberry+layoffs&amp;atb=v224-1&amp;ia=web&amp;iai=r1-3&amp;page=1&amp;sexp=%7B%22cdrexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22artexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prodexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prdsdexp%22%3A%22c%22%2C%22biaexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22msvrtexp%22%3A%22b%22%7D) of painful layoffs as it shifted from being a handset business to what it is today. Despite what the trust fund communists on this site would want you to think, firing people is never easy, and a lot harder than even hiring them. No manager wants to see his team shrunk,and no CEO wants to be painted as a chainsaw wielding asshole. $$ BB has a **history**, and that is a blessing and a curse.

**Remember**, Daddy chens primary focus for the past almost-decade has been driving a turnaround. The handset team? Gone. Money-losing International operations? Gone. But the smart monkes and useful apes who might be able to do more than throw feces at each other??? And these smart monkes who were retained  Well, no need to make a job posting for that role anymore, right?

# IMPLICATION #2  BLACKBERRY HAD &gt; 20K EMPLOYEES. UNTIL RECENTLY THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CUTTING, NOT GROWING, AND ONE OF THE FEW BENEFITS OF ITS PAST SHITTY HISTORY IS THAT THE COMPANY CAN NOW GROW VS. HAVING TO FIND NEW EMPLOYEES QUICKLY LIKE CERTAIN COMPETITORS

This brings me to the final part of our headcount analysis. Lets look at those endpoint security comparables again. Headcount is one thing, but of the quality of that headcount? Lets look at two two non-retard quotes 

***"I have my own theory about why the decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The product starts valuing the great salesmen, because they're the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company." Steve Jobs***

***If your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, its not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution. Peter Thiel***

I was curious and did comparison of the ratio of $BBs Engineering / IT monkeys to its sales. See below

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6nog6m62jze61.png?width=524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb26266cbef428abb3152f1b9077c1a0daee07b0

Even as a $BB bull, I didnt expect the discrepancy to be so large.

# IMPLICATION #3  BLACKBERRY ACTUALLY IS MORE OF AN ENGINEERING / IT FOCUSED COMPANY RELATIVE TO ITS PEERS. IN MANY WAYS IT IS MORE OF A START-UP. EVEN WITH FINANCIAL PRESSURE, JOHNNY CHEN RETAINED TECHNICAL TALENT. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE COMPANYS FUTURE, AND VALUATION ???

**TLDR: BB IS NOT A ROCKET SHIP. IT IS A LONG RANGE SHUTTLE, CAPABLE OF BURSTS OF SPEED, PACKED TO THE GILLS WITH RETARDS AND TERRAFORMING EQUIPMENT AND HEADING TO MARS.**

 Add'l edit for those who can't read good -       

Title: $BB DD, NO MEEMS - PART 1
Dear WSB - While I hold nothing aginst $GME, $AMC etc. - and imma let you finish - but $BB is one of the most solid fundamental, growth plays in the entire stock market, let alone the current trending meme names.

Forget about squozes and voodoo ass candlesticks. *#Ben Graham gang #*. There was a great post re: the company's product line up [here](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0a1p5/the_full_dd_on_bb_an_elon_muskjeff_bezos_sandwich/), make sure to check that out if you havent already.

My approach is to look at $BB from a ***strategic*** financial lens. First off, multiples off earnings are misleading, esp. w/ a company like BB where one-time and nonrecurring items are present and where there is a premium for growth vs. steady-state earnings. So as any Wall street spreadsheet monkey would do, I spread some comparables on earnings. Basically  How does the market value similar businesses? ?

No shit BB is not a phone company anymore. They are, if youve been paying any attention at all, an endpoint protection company. What is endpoint protection? Endpoints are basically computers, phones, but massively now also IoT  Your smart TV is an endpoint, so is your dumb refrigerator now that has to connect to wifi, and terrifyingly so is your car, your airplane, and stuff where if shit goes wrong the result is worse than not being able to double fist another helping of chocolate ice cream.

Almost every electronic device at this point that relies on internet access is an endpoint, with corresponding security challenges. So what does this mean? It means we can take a look at ***other endpoint protection / digital security*** companies, see how the market values them, and see what that implies for $BB based on its own revenue.

See below a quick spread. Based on the revenue multiples currently ascribed to comparables to Blackberry, Blackberry has a target price of **at least** **$60 / share.** And this is only if it is the average of its peers. I believe it is better for all the reasons previous posters have mentioned.

https://preview.redd.it/4q73p1tjize61.png?width=635&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=863fed2b3532f8b371a88ecb7fc438cd52fe0216

Long story short  Blackberry already has the infrastructure, moat, and products in place for growth. **IF MORE PEOPLE PERCEIVED BLACKBERRY AS WHAT IT IS TODAY - A FUTURE-FACING ENDPOINT PROTECTION BUSINESS WITH GIANT ASS MOATS IN FANTASTIC END MARKETS (E.G. MOBILITY / TRANSPORT), ITS SHARES WOULD ROCKET, SIMPLY BASED ON WHERE COMPARABLES ARE TRADING.**

In other words, ***the Company is a diamond still with a coating of shit*** (lack of public understanding of its current business). ***In fact its inclusion as a simple meme stock may have only added an extra layer of shit***. John Chen (look up his resume), is a world class operator, and frankly almost too low key for his own good. Personally as an Asian, I sympathize  sometimes the community focuses too much on keeping their heads down to work hard, and less than they should on messaging! Imagine if he meme'd like Elon!!!

No matter how good (or bad) the fundamentals are, you need a catalyst for the stock to moon. So, although I think it was a mixed blessing for BB to have been part of the scrum last week, there is a high likelihood of an inflection point in the perception of the company these next few weeks. You also saw the post on [reflexivity](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/) (basically, stonks up can make company good, not just company good make stonks up).

The best part is - **even if it doesn't moon, $$BB will steadily grow and develop. Imagine -** **Base case of going into orbit, with extreme upside of potential based on what's going on in the markets right now. FOr those of you non-retards, that's called** **POSITIVE EXPECTED VALUE**\*\*.\*\* **YOu don't have to try to "time the top" with this stock, because it's got fundamentals / non-technical reasons supporting the stock.** ***There's a reason John Chen took his bonuses entirely in stock the last few years.***

**TLDR: $BB = Buy Blackberry.**

Disclaime r - My day job is actually private investing (so unlike many of you monkes I actually will have W2 income this year), I am still a retard. I just like the stock and have been  since 2018.

Title: IFF - Updated Due Diligence And Potential HUGE Upside
Hey you guys! - Sloth

Well, today was quite a day, both for the standard GME and for my new favorite stock, IFF. 

TLDR: Buy IFF, there is the potential for massive short squeeze; Gamma squeeze at $150; and earnings multiple expansion to due merger with a DuPont subsidiary.

Well, today IFF closed at $130, on strong volume. Interestingly, there we extremely strong resistance to the standard laser afternoon short ladder (started at 2:50pm). There must be a whale buying who chose or hold the stock above $130 for the close.

The further good news is there is still low volatility on this stock, so the options remain affordable, for now. 

And, in regards to the Feb 19 $150 strike calls, volume was 40,000 with 177,000 open. Will be interesting to see if those purchases were to for open interest, or was someone moving them down to March.

Overall, it is still looking good for a short squeeze, and it is only 15% away from a monster Gamma squeeze at $150.

So, yes, hold GME, yes, I know there are counterfeit GME shares. I don't see how the counterfeit shares will help me make money though. 

This one, on the other hand, I expect to rise rapidly, with a big pop up after it gets past $150.

Yes,of course I have positions on IFF. And no, this isn't investment advice, just a recommendation to check it out yourself.

Title: AMC Short Interest is Actually 10-15% After Recent Equity Issuances - Efforts Should be Focused on GME!!!
**TL;DR: people are over-estimating AMC potential, true AMC short interest is 10-15% after a large number of recent equity issuances... FOCUS ON GME**

I ran this calculation after seeing different AMC short interest figures on various websites. ***I believe true AMC short interest is actually 10-15%***, which is significantly lower than what Market Watch, Yahoo Finance, etc. are saying (79% on Market Watch, 38% on Yahoo Finance, at the time of writing this post).

**Since AMC's Q320 filing which was released on 11/05/20, theyve issued a shit ton of shares through the below means, which I don't think these finance websites are accounting for:**

1. Raising $917mm in debt and equity through December and January; in a 1/22/201 filing they stated they had 287.3mm Class A shares outstanding ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/25/amc-says-bankruptcy-off-the-table-after-raising-more-than-900-million.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/25/amc-says-bankruptcy-off-the-table-after-raising-more-than-900-million.html))
2. Silver Lake Partners (a now past investor) converting their debt to equity and selling out last week, represented 44.2mm new Class A shares hitting the market ([https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-silver-lake-idUSKBN29Z00E](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-silver-lake-idUSKBN29Z00E))
3. Upcoming automatic conversion of Class B shares to Class A shares held by Dalian Wanda, a Chinese investor, represents 46.1mm new Class A shares that will hit the market soon (page S-18, [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf)).
4. Additionally, last week AMC filed to sell an additional 50mm Class A shares into the market ([http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf))

**Here is my calculation for short interest, including links to filings from the Company for reference:**

1. (A) 287,276,558 Class A Common Stock Outstanding as of 1/22/2021 + (B) 51,796,784 Class B Common Stock will automatically convert to Class A Common Stock at 1:1 ratio because on 12/14/2020 Dalian Wanda Group's holdings of Class B Common Stock fell to 30% of the aggregate number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock + (C) AMC filed to sell an additional 50,000,00 Class A Common Stock into the market -&gt; [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf), page 1 and page S-18
2. Silver Lake Group converted $600mm of Convertible Senior Secured Notes into 44,422,860 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock. Silver Lake then sold all those shares into the market last week. 5,666,000 of the Class B Common Stock outstanding then got cancelled as part of this conversion -&gt; [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/1517ecab-0e77-4700-bb90-b6ebb60e7648.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/1517ecab-0e77-4700-bb90-b6ebb60e7648.pdf), page 2 || [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/5fe2dc45-30a6-4e45-8c67-36015d973df1.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/5fe2dc45-30a6-4e45-8c67-36015d973df1.pdf), page 12
3. Looks like \~44.7mm shares are sold short
4. Total shares outstanding (excl. Wanda conversion and 50MM filing) = 287,276,558 + 44,422,860 = 331,699,418
5. Total shares outstanding (incl. Wanda conversion and 50MM filing (which they will probably complete given the high stock price)) = 331,699,418 + 51,796,784 - 5,666,000 + 50,000,000 = 427,830,202
6. Looks like \~3.0 shares are held by management / insiders, so float and short interest on #4 above = 328,704,636 / 13.6% short interest; and on #5 above = 424,835,420 / 10.5% short interest

***In summary, I think AMC is way overhyped and those looking for a short squeeze may still realize one, but at a much lower magnitude than they might believe. Focus should be on forcing the GME short squeeze, which still looks to have +100% short interest.***

Appreciate any and all discussion. My thoughts are my own, this is not financial advice.

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit 1:** I updated the link reference for AMC filing to issue another 50mm shares into the market.

**Edit 2:**

I've been getting some questions on why Yahoo Finance and Market Watch are wrong. Here are my thoughts:

We are all using the same number of shares short, so it's a matter of how you calculate shares outstanding and float. My guess is these free, generic finance websites use a very standard method of calculating short interest and apply it to all companies. They're not reading through filings and fine-tuning their calculations to be specific to each company.

**Yahoo Finance** ([https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc)): In Footnote 5, they state Shares Outstanding (and then I ASSUME Float as well) is based off the most recent quarterly or annual report. Their 287.28mm shares lines up with my #1. So it doesn't include Silver Lake's conversion of debt to equity, Dalian Wanda's upcoming conversion of Class B to Class A shares, or AMC's filing to sell an additional 50mm shares last week.

**Market Watch** ([https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc)): I can't figure out how they calculate 56.57mm public float, but their shares outstanding are the same 287.28mm as my #1. So even in the worst case scenario, if you believe my more conservative shares outstanding calculation of 331.7mm (point #5 instead of #6 to be conservative), that's an extra 44.4mm shares, which when added to Market Watch's float of 56.57mm shares, equals 100.97mm shares in the float and thus 44.3% short interest, which is significantly lower than the 79.0% they're showing. But still, I don't necessarily agree with their float calculation and can't figure out how they get to 56.57mm.

Title: Fundamental analysis of GME and an argument for why the speculation is perfectly reasonable
Hello to all you **special**, *fabulous*, and unsophisticated retail traders. I believe people should view GME how they view startups and tech companies, with a focus on their future potential and how their fundamentals will enable or hinder growth, instead of focusing on their current price to earnings and short term volatility. I'm long on Gamestop because of changes in leadership, their new business strategy, and because their fundamentals are ***ACTUALLY*** ***PERFECT*** for company beginning to restructure and transform.

* Considering the pandemic and overall state of electronic retailers, let's compare [Gamestop](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638020000134/gme-20201031.htm) and [Best Buy](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/764478/000076447820000062/bby-20201031x10q.htm) fundamentals using their October 2020 10-Qs. BBY is much bigger than GME, isn't currently losing money, and no analysts are concerned about them going bankrupt, so how do their fundamentals compare? They both have relatively strong balance sheets for retailers in 2020, and both companies have almost identical quick ratios and networking capital ratios (.5 and 1.0). Their current distribution of their current assets is similar, but one huge positive for GME is that their current assets are 37.5% cash and about 50% inventory, which is great for companies beginning to restructure. A large cash balance grants the means to launch new company strategies, inventory obviously/hopefully means future revenue for retailers, and a conservative net AR balance in 2020 is likely for the best (not overestimating how much outstanding revenue can be collected). The majority of the current liabilities for GME are AP and accrued expenses, which is standard for commercial retail companies. However, it's more important to note relatively low levels of actual ***current*** debt, ***long term*** debt, and why the effect of operating leases on total liabilities is bullshit and stupid. [ASC 842](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/advocacy/policy-positions/leases-what-investors-need-to-know) changed how leases are accounted for effective January 2019, so operating leases are now shown as current and long term liabilities. So while GMEs debt to equity ratio looks significantly worse than Best Buys, I'd argue that its actually better. Getting out of an operating lease for a small store like Gamestop is pretty easy to negotiate or buy out, not easy to get out of a lease for the massive stores Best Buy leases. Also being F500 and having a huge market cap skewers D/E considerably. GME has a ton of cash, limited debt, and operating leases that that can be exited with ***some relative*** ease if needed, so Gamestop can restructure with plenty of breathing room.
* Looking at the income statement and cash flows, GME earnings are not awful given the conditions of brick and mortar stores during a pandemic. While Gamestop has a net income loss, they have good gross profits, and their gross margin is better than Best Buy. Gross margin indicates their core sales and costs of goods sold (costs directly related to revenue) are solid are fundamentally good. They just have too many general and administrative (non-revenue producing) expenses. I wonder what they could do to reduce overhead expenses of supplying and maintaining retail stores? Also, net income loss  and loss in cash flows from operating activity in October 2020 was less than 2019. So while it's definitely not ideal to see they losses, they made significant progress towards having a positive net income ***IN A PANDEMIC/RECESSION***, and this was still before the PS5 or Xbox Series X was released in November. GME had a positive total cash flow, but it was driven primarily from the sale of property and equipment. Sale of property and equipment is typically not a good sign for companies (think of a McDonalds not selling enough burgers so it starts selling off fryers for positive cash flow) but I believe it will be [good for them](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/making-stores-matter-in-a-multichannel-world#).  This is one of the first steps in their transformation to an online retailer, which I believe will ultimately make them profitable again. If you don't believe me, you can read exactly what their plan is.
* Ryan Cohen and other Chewy executives [did not invest and join the Gamestonk board](https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-adds-chewy-ryan-cohen-wall-street-darling-to-board-2021-1) for the lulz. They liked GMEs plan and the unique opportunity that Gamestop presents, kind of like all of us shitheads here. I think their involvement in the company will provide the necessary knowledge and experience needed to grow improve e-commerce sales. The business strategy from their October 2020 10-Q:

&gt;**BUSINESS STRATEGY**  
&gt;  
&gt;In May of 2019, we announced our multi-year transformation initiative, which we refer to as GameStop Reboot to position GameStop on the correct strategic path and fully leverage our unique position and brand in the video game industry. Our strategic plan is anchored on the following tenets.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Optimize the core business.*** Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operations across the organization, including cost restructuring, inventory management optimization, adding and growing high margin product categories, and rationalizing the global store base. Prioritizing efforts to optimize the store base and improve the fundamental operations of the business yielded the net closure of 321 stores in fiscal 2019, 461 stores year-to-date in fiscal 2020, and included both the divestiture of the Simply Mac business and wind down of underperforming operations in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Improved inventory management drove a significant increase in inventory turns and as a result, in working capital, while an intense focus on organization structure and expense reductions yielded a $315.9 reduction in reported Selling, General and Administrative costs year-to-date in fiscal 2020.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Build a frictionless digital ecosystem.*** Develop and deploy a frictionless consumer facing digital first omni-channel environment, including the recent relaunch and customer experience enhancements within GameStop.com, the launch of a completely new GameStop App, as well as the optimization of our retail store footprint to maximize our customer reach more broadly across all channels and provide them the full spectrum of content and access to products they desire, however, wherever and whenever they want to shop. Enhancements to the user shopping experience and improved omni-channel capabilities, including expanded delivery and payment options, yielded an increase in e-commerce sales of over 430% through the third fiscal quarter of 2020.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Become the social / cultural hub for gaming.*** Create the social and cultural hub for games and entertainment and expand GameStops addressable market through category and product expansion to offer the most comprehensive product offering across the GameStop omni-channel platform. Our customers are increasing their engagement across the spectrum of games, entertainment and technology and our focus remains to meet those expanding needs.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Transform vendor partnerships.*** Transform our vendor and partner relationships to unlock additional high-margin revenue streams through an expanded suite of product and service offerings to optimize the lifetime value of every customer.  
&gt;  
&gt;Connected to our transformation efforts, we have incurred and continue to incur severance, store closure costs and expenses for consultants and advisors. See "Consolidated Results from OperationsSelling, General and Administrative Expenses" for further information.  
&gt;  
&gt;We continually review and prioritize our capital needs and are committed to making investments in our infrastructure to drive our business plans and realize on our transformation initiatives. Key areas of investment include improving the presentation and content as well as the functionality, general search and navigation across our customer facing digital channels; improving customer data integration and customer relations management capabilities; continuing to enhance service offerings to our customers; continuing to strengthen and deepen our information technology, analytics, marketing and e-commerce groups; and creating more flexible fulfillment options designed to improve our delivery capabilities and reduce our shipping costs. These and other investments are expected to, among other things, provide a seamless and compelling customer experience across our omni-channel retail platform.

* I still think shorts did not cover, red days are meaningless short ladders, there's probably counterfeit shares floating around, and media fuckery trying to stop a huge squeeze. But ***totally forgetting*** all that for a second, when the fuck did every single analyst on wall street start believing that fundamentals are the only thing that matters looking at stock price? A ton of startups and tech companies that IPO trade wildly higher than their fundamentals. A big reason for this is the emerging potential of their industry and investor belief in executive leadership, look at Elon and renewable energy or Portnoy and mobile sports betting. Why should people treat a restructuring company with good liquidity, great executive leadership, and [in an emerging industry](https://www.statista.com/topics/868/video-games/#dossierSummary__chapter2) any differently than we treat exciting startups or tech companies that aren't profitable? What's the difference between a company going through a significant and well calculated transformation vs a young new company IPOing?
* Based on all of my fundamental analysis, I feel comfortable setting a price target and sell limit of $69,420.69, cause stonk. I'm so behind on my work from today because I can't stop thinking about gamestonk and watching the price and volume on Think or Swim. Diamond hands forever but I need a break for a few days. Let me know if my DD is shit, and someone please message me if we hit my PT this week and/or if Steve Cohen gets sent to Rikers, ty and power to the playerzzz

Title: Why are we holding AMC? They are no longer on the SEC's "failure to deliver" list after January 12th
I feel like I got played so hard and it's all my fault for not doing my own research. Let this be a warning to all STOP PUTTING ALL FAITH INTO THE HIVE MIND AND DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. GME is clearly on SEC's "failure to deliver list" on every day provided meaning they are still most likely being shorted, but AMC is apparently cleared after the 12th meaning they are probably no longer being shorted.

SEC Site -[https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)

Fails-to-Deliver-Data -[https://www.sec.gov/files/data/fails-deliver-data/cnsfails202101a.zip](https://www.sec.gov/files/data/fails-deliver-data/cnsfails202101a.zip)

January 4th - AMC - 111,844 shares @ $2.12

January 5th - AMC - 1,631,091 shares @ $2.01

January 7th - AMC - 4,241,943 shares @ $2.01

January 8th - AMC - 11,547,981 shares @ $2.05

January 9-12th - AMC not on list

January 12th - AMC - 5900 shares @ $2.20

January 13-14th - AMC - not on list

I can see where the HYPE was coming from because apparently there was a failure to deliver 4M+ then 11M+ shares, but after that it looks like the "shorters" went on to short a much smaller supply. I guess there is still a possibility that the shorting continued, but I am having serious doubts. For those of you holding AMC, you might want to check into my claims to see that you and I got royally fucked. It's clearly not too big of a deficit if you need to sell, but you might want to sell if you have any profit left! unless you hold on to your shares with very little evidence of a future squeeze/potential (probably none). Maybe you'd like to hold onto until AMC becomes what they used to be (if that's possible), which I think I might do considering I bought in at 13 a piece. Anyway, hopefully this sparks a little controversy causing people to check my claim. I hope I'm wrong. BTW none of this is financial advise, do what you retards want

I'm definitely hanging on to my 1 GME and praying that bitch shoots to the moon

As for AMC, fuck those who are pushing for it, and fuck myself for believing in it

Found an interesting article, thought you retards might want to see:

Edit: I LIKE THIS STOCK AND IM HOLDING UNTIL PLUTO


TLDR: I think the options market is indicating that funds are committed to their GME shorts till March 2021. Ask yourself if you're willing to hold and outlast them. If the answer to that is yes, you can do something truly impactful here that ONLY GME can make happen. If the answer is no, then end the farce and accept that some people will go home winners, some people will go home losers, and the hedge funds will likely make most of their money back because that's what they do.

Title: Let's talk about the GME $800 Calls for 2/5, 2/12, 2/19 and 3/19
Okay fellow retards...time for some DD on the metric-fuckton of GME $800 call options for the above referenced expiration dates. 

Obligatory I am not a financial advisor, just a smooth brain neanderthal. 

I noticed a post earlier calling out the 3/19 $800 call options and the significant volume. I wanted to do some digging, below is my attempt to explain what *might* be going on. Constructive criticism and contrarian ideas are more than welcomed. 

Let's start with the numbers...there were a total of 29,935 contracts of the GME $800 calls traded across these 4 expirations. This is compared to only 9,106 of open interest (for all you autists out there that don't know, the open interest aka OI is how many contracts were open through yesterday). Tomorrow morning will be interesting to see if the OI increases or decreases...this will help us understand if some of that volume was opening new positions or closing existing ones but regardless, many of them *have to be opening* *new contracts* since the volume is 3x the OI. Proof below.

[GME 2\/5 $800 Calls](https://preview.redd.it/3ovlfm0r5ze61.png?width=1777&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac534b7e8fd03d8dc1b1ac3ff68e16e2773a5df6)

&amp;#x200B;

[GME 2\/12 $800 Calls](https://preview.redd.it/y9fov47t5ze61.png?width=1774&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b963e0f8e1a6edc6ab193cd64d7e9c6ffbe62aa)

[GME 2\/19 $800 Calls](https://preview.redd.it/4mui0z6x5ze61.png?width=1786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3937bb23e0bb7e2c1e74fcd9066817777d431c1b)

&amp;#x200B;

[GME 3\/19 $800 Calls](https://preview.redd.it/b21gob6z5ze61.png?width=1788&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=615555f4e98da988c49a89ea5991d6c7063ff7a9)

Why would there be so much volume today for the GME $800 calls across so many expirations? There's a lot of different reasons this could happen, let's conduct a process of elimination to hopefully follow Occam's Razor and see what is the most likely and/or most reasonable explanation. My first assumption is that hedge funds are responsible for the volume, too much $ for retail IMO. If I take the last price at market close of each contract and add it up, this is \~$57M...also note that these were all traded in small chunks throughout the day, no massive orders of 1,000 blocks or anything, largest is a hundred or so. They accumulated throughout the day so that $57M should be a conservative estimate. Perhaps these were traded in sweeps throughout the day to not get seen by option scanners?

I don't see a good reason why HF's would sell all these naked...could they collect premium on downward or flat movement of GME? Yes, but that seems like a poor method to do so since the delta stinks. It also exposes the seller to *massive* risk of having to sell shares should they end up ITM. It's like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller, just not worth the money...we know they don't have shares to sell, they need to buy shares to cover their shorts.

I also don't see why these would be covered calls where they own the underlying because DUH the whole point is they are trying to obtain shares of GME to cover.

If they weren't sold naked or covered, then they had to be bought, but why? Well...\~$57M isn't *that* much when you're down billions so far on your shorts. If GME's price can be driven down through short ladder attacks from HF's to shake out weak paper handed bitches, through artificially suppressed retail demand by Brokers and their fuckery,  and through the media's fear tactics, this means 2 *very important* things could be achieved: 1.) They can have GME's price be lower than it otherwise would to begin the squeeze en masse that they know is inevitable and 2.) they can recognize significant profit/hedging from their deep OTM calls options on the way up. 

The HF's were caught with their pants down and have been given the luxury of time and support from external actors (Fuck you, RH IBBK TD and every other shady broker and the media) to get their ducks in a row. They are trying to engineer the squeeze *on their terms* to reduce their losses. 

TLDR: There is a TON of GME $800 call volume across multiple strikes. Seems weird for them to be sold. Might be HF's plan to profit/hedge on way up once the real squeeze begins now that they have been able to grind GME down with short ladder attacks and artificially suppressed retail demand from asshole brokers.

Chime in my fellow Idiot-Savants!

Look at the same stats on Yahoo Finance for any other company. I can't find any company with anything remotely close to this number. They're (obviously) not over 100%, because HOW CAN IT BE?

It's insane to me that media outlets are saying hedge funds are closing out positions and are all on key. No big conspiracy, nothing to see here.

If something as simple as % ownership by institutions has these insane monkeyballs numbers, what else is going on really? Something smells VERY wrong here.

This house of cards can't stand up. These guys must be scared shitless because all the shit I've seen, every stat, every report, every DD it all leads back to one inevitable truth: THESE FUNDS NEED NEED NEED SHARES to cover up whatever it is they're trying to hide.

This is not a regular short squeeze and nothing about it feels normal.

Not financial advice. I just really like this stock, I can't help it.

EDIT: Look at my link to yahoo finance...and look at Short % of Float (Jan 15, 2021) = 226.42% [https://imgur.com/a/CVu9Ob2](https://imgur.com/a/CVu9Ob2)

CNBC and Bloomberg constantly telling us shorts have already covered and squeeze is over. That would mean that in the last 2 weeks, shorts would have had to cover over close to 90M shares. I think someone would have noticed that.

Title: Short ladder for smoothest brains
You and Karen tell your Boss you are going to buy all the houses in Green Meadows Eden (GME) because it is the only place that Boss can build a lithium mine and Boss sold millions of contracts for Lithium that he NEEDS to deliver.

You and Karen start buying houses at fair market value and selling them again for 10% less than fair market value. Residents see housing values fall and panic, and think they need to sell to avoid being the last worthless house. You and Karen keep buying and selling the same set of houses at cheaper and cheaper prices. Some paper handed idiots sell their grandpas farm because FMV keeps tanking.

If the ladder attack is successful you and Karen buy all the houses on the cheap because you NEED them and you successfully tanked the housing market in GME.

If you and Karen are the smoothest brains in the world, people catch on, buy the houses you are discounting for cheaper and cheaper and you need to offer more and more and more to buy the property because everyone realized you NEEDED the houses and some retail autist bought the houses you were trying to tank on the cheap.

Eventually, after paying a shit ton of closing costs (Interest) on the houses you are making no progress in buying the actual property you need and you need to start paying the inflated housing values for the property.

If people panic and sell on the cheap, win for HF. If people laugh and say suck it Melvin, then the property price rises and you get paid.

Should Karen win?

Title: Continuing DD wrt SEC Violations and Market Manipulation
Compiling some research, post not complete but being used to collect the SEC regulations that appear to have been violated based on all the GME shenanigans. This builds upon the work by u/johnnydaggers and others, cited at the end, that **EVERYONE should read.**

Feel free to **use this info ANYWHERE**, and **KEEP FUCKING BUILDING ON IT,** and certainly correct it, **just cite the people that are doing the DD!**

&amp;#x200B;

Now buckle up as I take you through the exhilarating world that is SEC regulations with regards to short selling and market manipulation as provided by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission!

&amp;#x200B;

***Rule 201  Short Sale Price Test Circuit Breaker***\*\*.\*\*     Requires trading centers to establish, maintain,    and  enforce written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to  prevent the execution or display of a short sale at an impermissible price when a stock has triggered a circuit breaker by experiencing *a* **price decline of at least 10 percent in one day.** *Once the circuit  breaker in Rule 201 has been triggered, the price test restriction* ***will  app*****ly to short sale orders in that security for the remainder of the day**  **and the following day,** unless an exception applies.

*Rule 203(b)(1) and (2)  Locate Requirement*.  Regulation SHO requires a broker-dealer to have **reasonable grounds to believe that the security can be borrowed** so that it can be delivered on  the date delivery is due before effecting a short sale order in any  equity security.[\[7\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn7) **This locate must be made and documented prior to effecting the short sale.**

# Did brokers have a place where they "reasonably" believed they could get the shares from?

# Answer: FUCK NO

[Figure 2: Screen shot from AlphaRRCapital as shown in u\/monarchy8822 post \[2\] ](https://preview.redd.it/8y5x154d1ze61.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6a712811e30e7d1f55637a5dc04445ca48e9d41)

**Rule 204  Close-out Requirement.** Rule 204 requires brokers and dealers that are participants of a registered clearing agency[\[8\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn8)to  take action to close out failure to deliver positions. Closing out     requires the broker or dealer to purchase or borrow securities of  like    kind and quantity. The participant must close out a failure to   deliver   for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of   regular   trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement   date,   referred to as T+4. If a participant has a failure to deliver   that the   participant can demonstrate on its books and records  resulted  from a   long sale, or that is attributable to bona fide market making activities, the participant must close out the failure  to deliver by  no   later than the beginning of regular trading hours on  the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date,  referred to as    T+6. If the position is not closed out, the broker or  dealer and any    broker or dealer for which it clears transactions (for  example, an    introducing broker)[\[9\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn9)**may  not effect further short sales in that security without borrowing    or  entering into a bona fide agreement to borrow the security (known  as    the pre-borrowing requirement) until the broker or dealer  purchases    shares to close out the position and the purchase clears and  settles**.   In  addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that    participants  of a registered clearing agency must immediately   purchase  shares to  close out failures to deliver in securities with   large and  persistent  failures to deliver, **referred to as threshold securities,** if the  failures to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.[\[10\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn10) **Threshold securities are equity securities**[**\[11\]**](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn11)**that  have an aggregate fail to deliver position for five consecutive     settlement days** at a registered clearing agency (e.g., National     Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC)); **totaling 10,000 shares or more; and equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer's total shares outstanding.**    As  provided in Rule 203 of Regulation SHO, threshold securities are     included on a list disseminated by a self-regulatory organization     (SRO). Although as a result of compliance with Rule 204, generally a     participants fail to deliver positions will not remain for 13     consecutive settlement days, if, for whatever reason, a participant of a     registered clearing agency has a fail to deliver position at a     registered clearing agency in a threshold security for 13 consecutive     settlement days, the requirement to close-out such position under Rule     203(b)(3) remains in effect.

# So, is GME a "threshold security" as defined by the SEC here:

* Outstanding Shares of GME:     \~ 69,750,000
* 0.5% of Outstanding GME Shares = \~300,000
* "aggregate fail to deliver position for five consecutive settlement days" = 2,351,180
* Is 2.3 million &gt; 0.5% of Outstanding GME Shares **AND** is 2.3 million &gt; 10,000 shares?

# Yea, it fucking is!

# Well, then they stopped issuing shorts until the previous ones closed position and settled, right..... RIGHT?!

# BECAUSE SIMPLE MINDED RETAIL INVESTOR!

( ...now go invest in silver)

I'm still reading through it myself, and make corrections and add to it as you see fit, but it seems that there have been violations of **SHO Rules 201,203, and 204. PLEASE CONTINUE TO DO THE DD and USE MINE and OTHERS posts to DO THE FUCKING SEC's JOB FOR THEM!!!!!**

&amp;#x200B;

# IN CONCLUSION, HOLD THE FUCKING LINE!!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR;**

1. NO SHORTS should have been executed Thursday when GME dropped down to $132 because it fell more than 10%, or any of the other fucking days!!!!
2. No new shorts should have been issued because there's no reasonable belief that they could find actual stock to lend given 140% short float as reported from December, and I doubt they secured it PRIOR to issuing new stock
3. They should have already executed the failed to deliver shorts ASAP because of the high number of FTD's and the high number of shorted shares

Title: $FUBO DD - This stock could moon
***Please Note:*** *This is for those of you who are not all-in on GME and like to look at alternatives. Not saying sell GME to buy FUBO, just saying there are other interesting alternatives out there, and FUBO is one of them. Also, it's heavily shorted.*

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Share Facts -**

* **FuboTV, ticker FUBO**
* **IV:** Around 200% this morning on puts expiring Feb-12th
* **FUBO earnings date:** ~~Estimated to be Feb 5th~~ March 2nd (my Broker was estimating the date, but earnings released date has now been confirmed)
* **Share Float:** 52.06M (as per [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FUBO/key-statistics?p=FUBO))
* **Short % of Float:** 72.74% (as of Jan 15th, as per [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FUBO/key-statistics?p=FUBO))
   * I mention this because FUBO was heavily shorted when the stock rose in the $60s, and unfortunately shorters succeeded in crashing the price.
* **Market Cap:** $2.85 B

**My position**

* 38 shares @ approx. $31
* 100 shares @ approx $43 bought this morning, and sold a covered call at $55 strike for $6.10 for Feb-12th. I'm sure I'll regret it, but the yield on both the call itself, and the potential yield if I get called away for downright phenomenal, hard to turn down.

&amp;#x200B;

**- The DD -**

**What is FuboTV?**

Mama Wood said it herself (paraphrasing here): Cable is dying, to hell with cable, we want MOAR STREAMING!!!!!!!!!

Seriously, cable and television plans are dying. Nowadays you have a ton of flexible solutions, from the obvious Netflix and YouTube, to Amazon Prime, Sling TV, Hulu, etc. FUBO is capitalizing on this trend for sports fans. It is the country's first sports-first service. While the price might seem steep, it gives you access to dozens of regional, national and international sports channels, including live events in 4K HDR.

Beyond sports, it offers much more; 112 channels in total, including 43 of the top 50 Nielson-rated networks (for you autists and retards out there, Nielson is an American information, data and market measurement firm operating in over 100 countries and employing 44,000 people (says Wikipedia, Im too retarded to do more research on them). Sample non-sports related channels on FUBO include: A&amp;E, Adult Swim, AMC, BBC America, Bravo, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, etc. Yes, they even have the Weather Network.

**Recent acquisitions:**

No DD of a hyper fast growing company would be complete without discussing acquisitions.

* **Vigtory:** The company is in the process of acquiring and integrating Vigtory Inc to the platform. Vigtory is a sportsbook (sports betting). It will also remain available to those not using FuboTV (aka: additional revenues, but also additional marketing for FuboTV)
* **Balto:** Balto develops tools for users to organize and play fantasy sports games, and FuboTV intends to combine its technology with Balto to launch a free-to-play gaming offering.

**Some numbers (yes, the quant stuff):**

Average revenue per user (ARPU) has gone from $37.93 per month in 2019, to $53.73 in 2019, and to $67.70 in the latest quarter. In contrast, its average monthly cost per user has risen from $40.59 in 2018 to $56.78 in the last quarter. Yes, they were obviously operating at a loss, and yes they are now operating at a positive contribution profit. As of the latest quarter, they had 455,000 paid subcribers. Grand news, yes?

**Q3 results, and guidance for Q4:**

Spoiler alert: The numbers are fantastic.

* Q3: Revenues of $61.2 million, an increase of close to 50% on a YoY basis.
   * Breaking revenues down: Subscription revenues up by 64% at $53.4 million, and advertising revenues up by 153% at $7.5 million
   * Paid subscribers increased by 58% on a YoY basis, and ARPU increased by 14% on a YOY basis. [See here the meteoric rise](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201110005911/en/fuboTV-Announces-Q3-2020-Results). Sexy, aint it?
   * Hours spent watching FuboTV also skyrocketed, an increase of 83% YoY (133.3 million hours). Monthly Active Users watched on average 120h per month. This is a 20% increase YoY
* Q4 guidance: Spoiler alert: They raised their guidance mid quarter because they are so bloody awesome
   * Q4 revenue to be expected between $94 to $98 million, prior guidance was $80 to $85 million. The new guidance represents a 77% to 84% YoY revenue increase
   * Paid subscribers to be expected to exceed 545,000, prior guidance was 500k to 510k. The new guidance represents a 72% YoY increase.

**What now?**

Sure, they are not profitable yet. Big whoop, they are still young, FuboTV was founded in 2015. But you know what? It took ages for Netflix to become profitable (about 7 or 8 years, I believe). The way FUBO is growing their paid subscribers base, and the way the hours are increasing YoY, we can expect them to reach profitability sooner rather than later. When? I dont have a crystal ball, if I do Id be a billionaire. We can expect that as they continue to scale up and add more users, they will continue to increase their advertisement revenues (duh), and also that their cost of new client acquisition will become lower (also duh)

**What are the risks?**

* For FUBO to thrive and grow, they need live sports. COVID dented their growth due to professional sports suspending seasons. If we go into another massive lockdown (less and less likely as vaccines ever so slowly roll out), this could cause another dent in their growth.
* Its still heavily shorted, as the price continues to go up (especially if they smash their guidance), expect some shady shit GME-style from hedge funds to bring the price down.

**TLDR:** Awesome growth potential, heavily shorted (not at the GME scale, but still heavily shorted so you need to be mindful of that and potential WSB attention to the stock, or potential shady business from shorters).

Title: THE VW SQUEEZE CHART THAT IS BEING CIRCULATED IS PRICED IN GERMAN CURRENCY, NOT US DOLLARS...
So I finally decided to go look at the Volkswagen squeeze for myself.

And Im kind of shocked. Nobody mentioned that the circulating chart of the VW squeeze chart is actually priced in German currency. 

If you look at the American stock ticker chart, yes the price squeezed, BUT it only squeezed from 20 dollars to $116... 

Im just saying we might have actually been squeezed already. We went from 20 bucks to $500.

Title: MODS PLEASE DON'T DELETE - Serious comment about discussing legality of GME shorts!
I've seen so many posts talking about whether what these hedge funds are doing is legal, whether they're legally required to eat their losses, etc. This community needs to understand something:

For these hedge funds, LEGALITY IS IRRELEVANT.

ALL THAT MATTERS IS PRESERVATION OF CAPITAL.

Capital buys politicians, regulators (Yellen) and lawyers to delay and diminish any possible consequences.

Capital means dodging $100 billion in losses today in exchange for a $100 million fine a year from now.

Batten down the hatches and expect this fight to continue.

No one went to jail in '08 for destroying the economy. It's highly likely no one is going to jail for this.

Don't expect s\*\*\* from our legal system.

We will prevail, but don't expect a quick outcome.

Title: When to expect movement on $GME
So this is some very smooth-brain DD, but I was reading up on common market patterns ([recommended reading](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/112601.asp)) and noticed some similarities with $GME and a [pennant pattern](http://imgur.com/a/TPKVAuG). Basically, if you plot a line intersecting the days' low and a separate line connecting the days' high, where these lines intersect can indicate when the pattern will "break". Connecting the dots on $GME suggests this could happen Wednesday ([$GME pennant](http://imgur.com/a/MUmsdHC)).

Title: STICK TOGETHER NOW OR GO DOWN IN VAIN
Ever heard the term divide and conquer? They won today because you retards kept focusing your energy in the wrong place. Instead of sticking to the  game plan, you spent the weekends bashing the boomers and gold bugs. You seem to forget who is the enemy here--it's not Silver, I can guarantee you that. All this silver bashing is causing the boomers and the gold bugs to ditch our movement. Stop it now!

It's perfectly normal for hedge funds to hedge their long or short Silver positions. The #silvershortsqueeze is real and the [boomers are actually buying up physical silver](https://i.imgur.com/BLCeAQv.png) right now. They've been doing it all week even before all of this GME news went viral. The CEO of APMEX, the biggest gold and silver dealer in the world have confirmed that the boomers have been buying up physical silver all of last week ([https://www.apmex.com/pressreleases/apmex-statement-on-current-market-conditions](https://www.apmex.com/pressreleases/apmex-statement-on-current-market-conditions)).

&amp;#x200B;

Disclosure: I'm holding both GME and PSLV for the cause. Stop bashing me. [Bears](https://i.imgur.com/DAEsebM.png) are in control of GME right now, but the battle can still be won. We need all the support we can get right now, whether it's from the the gold bugs or the boomers. We're fighting against very powerful people here. You've seen what they're capable of last week. Let's stop bashing each other and focus on the battle.

Title: Staying focused on GME for a reason.
Crazy.  Guys we need to jump back on gme.  Holding together is the only chance we have of ever getting anything done da**it!!! I just joined today but been watching for over a week.  This isn't about stupid jokes it's about getting back at the thieves that rob America every day! If we hold this up long enough the rest of the world will follow.  We have the world's attention and you are going to let the SLV trolls take it away???

If we can do this we can change the world.  Hedge funds will be at their knees for us, and deservedly so.  

Buy GME.
Hold GME

Whatever you do I'm going to keep going.  We literally are capable of changing the country for the better. I might be an idealistic retard but the alternative is to sulk back into the basement and let's the Hedgers destroy the country.

Come on guys!

Please!!!

Title: $FUBO may be the next best squeeze target after $GME.
At least 70% short interest.  
Increased guidance.     
Outperform and PT ($50) increase by wed bush.  
322% 52-wk return.
Have a legit business in sports media and are rapidly rolling out their sports betting platform.  The sentiment and analysts opinions seems to be rather bullish considering the amount of shorts.  I think we might have a sleeping giant here.  
This isnt a struggling business being heavily shorted.  This is something that already has a reason for a higher valuation but can get squeezed far higher.  $GME had the same elements.  Lots of shorts on a business that wasnt hurting as bad as people thought.

Title: Bearish $GME Fails-To-Deliver data for 1H January
So the SEC has published fails-to-deliver data for 2021-01-1H, and it doesn't look great for the bull case for $GME.

Here's some background information on what this means: http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html

The SEC publishes bi-monthly data on Fails-To-Deliver - https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm

Here's the data rolled up into something you can actually read:

ALL of December 2020 - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NBnc1hD5SUdtjIrpqGAlRK7WoW8x-oef/view?usp=sharing

1H January 2021 - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fyd44ELaptX5_dWYbxEJOvqgzwrcoKvB/view?usp=sharing

I'll let people smarter than me offer interpretations, but fails-to-deliver appears to be *decreasing* over time, which I think would be consistent with shorts covering their positions.

Title: FEYE - Playing tomorrows FireEye Q4 earnings based on recent SolarWinds hack
Bullish on FEYE over next few quarters. To me its unclear how the recent SolarWinds hack will impact Q4 earnings due to the timing of the hack. On a recent conf call Mandia mentioned that Incident Response hours arent billed until after the incident response engagement is over. The SolarWinds news broke on Sunday Dec 13th.  Response engagements of this scale typically take weeks if not months. So we might be looking at meeting Q4 estimates but raising Q1 guidance.  Even without a beat, Ill take this as a bullish sign. 

Ive been watching job openings at FireEye for the last month.  Theyve been recruiting non-stop and a large portion of these at Incident Response or other services consultants. There are currently 192 open roles.  

Back of the napkin calculations are... many of the senior roles will be sent immediately into the field at a billing rate between $250-$450. At a 80% utilization that is between $400k-$720k per head per year. If they have hired between 50-100 people into these roles since the Solarwinds hack that is could lead to $20M-$36M revenue increase on the low end to $40M-$72M on the high end. With current annual revenues at $928M we could see an annual revenue increase of 7% on these services alone which is above their current 6.9% revenue growth rate. If we see acceleration in any of their newish businesses like Managed Defense and Mandiant Advantage Cyber Threat Intelligence services we could have a great growth story on our hands. Incident Response services are (hopefully) a one time thing for breached companies but Managed Defense and Intel services are a recurring revenue stream, so growth in these areas would be a very good thing indeed. 

Any upticks in the hardware business would be positive news, but I believe they are facing upgrade cycle challenges and Im not expecting much on this front. 

Finally, I wouldnt be surprised if we saw FEYE acquired by a larger player in the next few months. There have been multiple rounds of rumors over the last few years that indicate FEYE has hired an investment bank to assist with the process. While Mandia hasnt confirmed these rumors, he hasnt denied them either. Cisco allegedly passed. I think good candidates are Microsoft, IBM or even someone like CrowdStrike using their astronomically high share price to swing a deal and create a cyber powerhouse to rival Pali Alto.  

Im long with shares, considering NTM/OTM LEAPS, might by some June calls.  FD weeklies might payout but are risky IMO.

Title: ICLN is a strong hold under President BUYDEN
ICLN is an etf that holds a lot of green energy stocks - a lot of $PLUG power as well. It has been growing steadily thus far and I know it will grow a lot more into 2021 with Biden putting up a lot of money into green energy. 

Here's a list of things Biden is doing for green energy, which will ultimately push ICLN upwards :

1. Joining the Paris Climate Agreement
2. Cancelling the Keystone Oil Pipeline
3.  Biden will invest $400 billion over ten years, as one part of a broad mobilization of public investment, in clean energy and innovation. That investment is twice the investment of the Apollo program which put a man on the moon, in todays dollars. He will also establish ARPA-C, a new research agency focused on accelerating climate technologies. 
4. Biden will set a target of reducing the carbon footprint of the U.S. building stock 50% by 2035, creating incentives for deep retrofits that combine appliance electrification, efficiency, and on-site clean power generation. He will work with our nations governors and mayors to support the deployment of more than 500,000 new public charging outlets by the end of 2030. And, Biden will ensure our agricultural sector is the first in the world to achieve net-zero emissions, and that our farmers earn income as we meet this milestone. 
5.  Biden will require public companies to disclose climate-related financial risks and the greenhouse gas emissions in their operations and supply chains. In his first year, hell work to enact legislation requiring polluters to bear the full cost of their climate pollution. But thats not all: Biden will direct his EPA and Justice Department to pursue these cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and, when needed, seek additional legislation to hold corporate executives personally accountable  including jail time when merited. Allowing corporations to continue to pollute  affecting the health and safety of both their workers and surrounding communities  without consequences perpetuates an egregious abuse of power. These companies must be accountable to the American people, the communities where they operate, and the workers they employ. 
6.  Every federal dollar spent on rebuilding our infrastructure during the Biden Administration will be used to prevent, reduce, and withstand the impacts of this climate crisis. American workers should build American infrastructure and manufacture all the materials that go into it, and all of these workers must have the option to join a union and collectively bargain. Biden will ensure his [infrastructure legislation](https://joebiden.com/infrastructure) incorporates labor provisions so federal investments create millions of middle-class jobs, benefiting workers across industries. 

All of this is straight from his website. Since ICLN is an etf and does not swing ( A good thing IMO ) it is an extremely good candidate for buying shares.

But since we like to live on the edge, the best thing for us to do would be to buy ATM or ITM options that expire a long time from now. 

Position : 1 ICLN 30c exp 1/21/2021 ( Can only afford 1. I am a student and rest is in GME )

Title: WSB can speed up path for lung cancer cure, $TAK
Yeah i know this sounds like clickbait or some bs but $TAK Is one of cathie woods biggest holding, i stated that first because people love her and hope that makes people pay attention. Tak is also one of the leading company in world for the process of discovering cures for cancer . Guess what they are also pretty strongly  shorted and Ceo has stated that they need further cash for more clinical trials. 2k in April 25$ calls will turn out to 10k if its in the money. Really cheap play here. bringing some real attention to a stock like this has nothing but positives. 

"This company is old as shit" (240 years to be exact), and
"Fuck Biopharmaceuticals/Biotech companies, I've always gotten burned"
Well, after what's transpired with $GME and $BB gang, we know that no matter what, an "old" company can have a big future if they set themselves up correctly with a competitive advantage. AND stop trying to play earnings/binary events and just buy and hold shares. Less stress, less autism, guaranteed money if the business is solid.

How Did this Company Catch My Eye?

Simply put, because of our GILF and Savior, Cathie Woods. So how does Mama Woods play into this? If you subscribe to ARK's trade notifications (I only started as of 12/15/20), take a look at how often TAK appears as a "BUY" since the beginning of December 2020 for their ARKG ETF.

Title: Why $VALE (Vale SA) is a buy.
$VALE is a mining company (one of the largest in the world. They specialize in mining Iron Ore, Nickel, Manganese, Coal, and Copper. It has huge upside with the potential to 10x at a moment's notice.

20% of Analysts rank it as a Strong Buy

80% of Analysts rank it as a Buy

However, the price targets are not the high, why? They have been fined 2 billion dollars by the Brazilian government over a collapsed dam, but that doesn't really matter in the short term does it.

$VALE produces Nickel and Copper which are fundamental to battery production, and it just so happens there is a worldwide shortage on Nickel which is fundamental to battery production. The EV market continues to expand, and with continued growth more and more nickel is needed to meet demand.

So why the huge upside potential?

One Answer: Papa Elon

Elon Musk has said a number of times that Tesla will give sustainable mining companies a large agreement. I believe that the time for a large Tesla contract is soon, and VALE in my opinion is most likely to receive the contract. If this were to happen I would not doubt a price jump of 10x immediately to fall and stay steady at 5x at around $80-$100 a share similar evaluation to $CAT in the short term, and if battery production continues at exponential growth I could this becoming a trillion dollar company by 2030.

Let me know your thoughts. Do you think I am right or just a retard redditor?

Edit: I have also seen a large order volume for 2/19 21C if that is any indicator of anything, perhaps insider knowledge. I am unsure, but these are just my observations.

Edit 2: Earnings are the day after tomorrow and there's always a possibility of an earnings surprise.

Title: The Importance of Volume
Hi guys,

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/low\_volume\_pullback.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/low_volume_pullback.asp)

"Low volume pullbacks are often a sign of weak longs taking profit, **but suggest that the long-term uptrend remains intact."**

This Zacks link goes into good detail on interpreting low volume and stock price manipulation:

[https://finance.zacks.com/mean-stock-price-goes-up-down-little-volume-2497.html](https://finance.zacks.com/mean-stock-price-goes-up-down-little-volume-2497.html)

" Interpreting Price and Volume Action

Price action reflects investor sentiment. If a stock is rising, investors are eager to buy; if it is falling, investors are eager to sell. **But for a move to be valid, the stock price action must be confirmed by volume**. As technicians say, volume goes with the trend. **Volume shows how much conviction investors have in a trend.**

When you multiply the number of shares traded by the current stock price, you get the total dollar amount that investors are willing to put at risk. **Low volume means few investors are putting only a little money at risk. You cannot trust such price moves, as they are fickle and can easily reverse."**

 

## Understanding Manipulation

**It is easier to manipulate a stock when its volume is low**. **All a manipulator needs to do is execute a few carefully timed trades to create the illusion that a stock is moving so he can get others to buy or sell**. **The goal is** to raise the price if he wants to sell and t**o lower the price if he wants to buy**. If you are suckered in by such a move, your position can quickly turn into a loss as the stock you just bought suddenly reverses course on increased volume.

Title: Why we're still winning, and why we're still going to the moon. [REASSURANCE DD]
I've spent the past 5 fucking hours researching this shit and stumbled across some absolutely GAME CHANGING information that everyone should know about.
This is a long read but bare with me, this is some important shit and it will make your diamond hands even diamondier.

&gt; Short selling involves a sale of a security that the seller does not own or a sale which is consummated by the delivery of a security borrowed by, or for the account of, the seller. Short sales normally are settled by the delivery of a security borrowed by or on behalf of the seller.

&gt; In a naked short sale, however, the short seller does not borrow securities in time to make delivery to the buyer within the standard three-day settlement period. As a result, the seller fails to deliver securities to the buyer when delivery is due.

&gt; **Sellers sometimes intentionally fail to deliver securities as part of a scheme to manipulate the price of a security, or possibly to avoid borrowing costs associated with short sales, especially when the costs of borrowing stock are high.**

**This is what happened today with the price decrease**

#IMPORTANCE OF FAIL-TO-DELIVER

The SEC just released the Fail-To-Deliver data for the first half of January.

To nobody's surprise, Gamestop short sellers Fail-To-Deliver a whopping... 

~~5 MILLION~~

*edit: Apparently the Fail-To-Deliver is not cumulative, but as of 1-14 it's 621,483 and that number can only be higher now. Regardless, the sentiment stands.*

shares of the stock meaning these short sellers are using Naked Short Selling and intentionally failing to deliver securities in order to avoid borrowing costs and manipulate the price of the stock downward.

# What's to be done?

Rule 204.

&gt; Rule 204  Close-out Requirements. Under Rule 204, participants of a registered clearing agency (as defined in section 3(a)(24) of the Exchange Act) must deliver securities to a registered clearing agency for clearance and settlement on a long or short sale transaction in any equity security by settlement date, or must close out a fail to deliver in any equity security for a long or short sale transaction in that equity security generally by the times described as follows: the participant must close out a fail to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+4; if a participant has a fail to deliver that the participant can demonstrate on its books and records resulted from a long sale, or that is attributable to bona-fide market making activities, the participant must close out the fail to deliver by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+6. In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in threshold securities if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days. Threshold securities, as defined by Rule 203(c)(6), are generally equity securities with large and persistent fails to deliver.

You can read more about this here: https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/242.204 lots of information that I haven't covered.

Gamestop *is* or will be classified as a threshold security due to the massive amounts of Fail-To-Deliver's they've accumulated this month, this means short sellers are legally forced to close their short positions and clearing houses will be be required to immediately purchase shares within the time-frame stated above. AKA SQUEEZE WILL BE SQUOZEN.

Edit: According to [this](https://www.theocc.com/Market-Data/Market-Data-Reports/Series-and-Trading-Data/Threshold-Securities-List) website, Gamestop IS listed as a threshold security.

#SHORT SELLERS ARE UNDER THE THUMB, AND ITS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEY'RE SQUEEZED.

Their last hail mary is to manipulate the price downward as much as possible to lessen the blow of the inevitable squeeze. We literally have them by the balls and all we have to do is HOLD.

#TL:DR

The short squeeze is a ticking time bomb right now and all we have to do is hold to win. In a matter of days, short sellers will be FORCED to close their positions and clearing houses will be forced to purchase shares for all Fail-to-Delivers forcing the price to skyrocket and the squeeze to be squozen.

HOLD TIGHT YOU RETARDS, WE'RE GOING TO THE MOON.

Title: Reminder: The Volkswagon chart pulled back HARD for 6 straight days before liftoff in 2008
[https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/VOW.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/VOW.DE)

Set the date to bracket October through December of 2008. Notice that after peaking at 428, the stock slowly and painfully dragged down under low volume to 201 before launching to the moon the next day. It also stayed on the moon for several days before returning to earth. These investors didn't lose by forgetting to check the stock price for 5 minutes or going to the bathroom at the wrong time. They only lost if they didn't have  .

Please correct me if I'm missing something important. Anybody who is looking to the Volkswagon squeeze as a historical precedent for GME aught to know that it was a process with many ups and downs.

I like GME. I've got 13 shares, and in the morning I plan to convert 120 AMC to GME.

Title: Almost 75% of all retail $GME orders were to buy (Fidelity). DONT BUY INTO THE FUD 
**FINAL EDIT**: There are critical support levels of retail buying points. Those are 143 (which was unbroken at the tie of writing), 68, and 38. 68 (8:10 - 8:25 AM today, Feb. 4 '21) has clearly broken as people closed off positions at breakeven and the flood gates down burst open. Another sell off between 10:00 &amp; 10:15 AM coincided with another sell wall at 64-62. I think we'll make it all the way to 30-40 before it'll make sense to start buying long again (you saw what happened at 64-68; the same will likely happen at 34-38 but I don't know where the exact floor is).

The data has been showing, since the 140s, that retail isn't holding. ***The data presented as the cornerstone and namesake of this DD is no longer relevant***. The ratio of volume of shares per sell order relative to buy order appears to be higher than the ratio of buy orders to sell orders. In other words, there may be a 3:1 distribution of raw orders, but the sells are so much more packed that it breaks the ratio anyway. *The situation changed and as more data came to light, I now know I was wrong.*

*I used to be a HODLer* ***until the situation changed***. I lost out on a lot of profit by holding through waning evidence at the 300s, 200s, and 150s, and only pulled at 111I was able to secure a little bit of profit to make this obsession a bit more worthwhile. At time of writing, the price is 52.60. Even with bullish conviction, this was still a directionally correct move as I can now buy double as much as I had before.

That being said, I think we're in for more downside, and I will not be buying back until we hit the bottom, wherever that may be. ***I'm still long-term bullish on the company transformation and will re-enter a moderately sized position after the volatility settles down.***

**Here's the original DD so you can see how I had brought up good data, but was directionally incorrect in my sprinkled analysis of it. Learn from this like I did, and you'll be more successful in the future.** Furthermore, I will not stop writing DDs because I think the data here is sound and makes sense. What was wrong was the analysis, which can happen to anyone with this many unknown variables. Future DD will take confirmation bias into account and will have higher probability of being on the money.

Today's most traded retail assets on Fidelity were $AMC &amp; $GME.

And you know what people did? They bought a metric fuckton of shares. Contrary to what some of the Reddit Daily thread sentiment (which may or may not be bot-infested hell at this point) &amp; news outlets claim, retail has seemingly not lost any interest in the stock and possibly prevented it from diving further.

Obligatory disclaimer: Mods, for the love of god please let this through it took a lot to write and I know for a fact it hasn't been discussed sufficiently / didn't get a dedicated post yet. Also, I'm a  and am not financial advisor and this isn't financial advice. This is a synthesis of public available information with autistic analysis like sprinkles on a birthday cupcake.

Disclaimer 2: I am extremely long $GME 

**UPDATE**: my stop loss got triggered and I am no longer long $GME until data changes. The information here has not changed, but the impact and its magnitude may have.

With that out of the way, I present to you,

# Exhibit A: Order Distribution

\~***75%*** of all $GME orders on Fidelity *today, on 2/1* were to *buy* the asset, rather than sell it. Each order can have however many shares.

[https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml)

That's just Fidelity. If you're able to check the order distribution on other brokers (like Vanguard or Schwab) please post it below and I'll update this post with your info. Usually this information is displayed on Top Traded Stocks or on the stock page itself under some tab.

There's more:

WeBull is showing a 45/55 distribution on the entire order book. Total Outflow (sells) was quoted at 1099, and total inflow at 996. While this may seem useless at first, consider this: the share price lost ***30***% today, but the order book is split ***45/55***, not ***35/65***. Just 10% of the outflow accounted for the 30% collapse in share price.

# Exhibit B: Volume

[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/)

Today's volume was half of the daily average. *Half of the daily average*. And while the price 30% movement may seem scary at first, trending down on low volume is actually a bullish sign. Courtesy of u/weedcomet:

"[https://finance.zacks.com/importance-price-changes-previous-day-stock-market-2906.html](https://finance.zacks.com/importance-price-changes-previous-day-stock-market-2906.html) 'After a strong-volume upward move, if the market moves sideways in conjunction with lower volume for several days in a row, it is a bullish sign indicating that all overhanging selling pressure has been relieved and any buying could spark a strong price rise.'"

In other words, flat or even *declining* on low volume often precedes   . Literally any form of significant buying can move the price by a very high magnitude.

There's also been studies done on this phenomena, and correlation was established between sideways or negative movement on low volume and a subsequent increase in price. Feel free to research this on your own accord and post your findings below for all of us autists to read.

# Exhibit C: Why Retail Buying May Return Soon

I'm not a financial advisor, and even less so Nostradamus. I don't know when we'll be able to take advantage of this sideways movement to our benefit. What I do know is that that time is approaching. Considering two major events:

1. Transition from Robinhood &amp; other affected brokers to mainstream solutions This was likely started en masse on Thursday, before RH transfer restrictions kicked in. It takes 2-5 market days to transfer an account to another broker, and about the same for just slushing cash around. That means, a solid chunk of trades will be able to buy into the market beginning tomorrow and throughout the remaining week.Many are also in the process of opening up new accounts. These were probably started en masse on Friday, when transfer restrictions prevented people from taking the plunge. A solid chunk of brokers need settlement time for instant deposits.- The instant deposits are capped, meaning whale accounts aren't able to kick in yet. Regular deposits takes 1-2 business days to clear. Beginning tomorrow, we'll start seeing larger retail accounts com online and regain their impact on price delta.
2. Robinhood bottleneck may or may not disappear this week. Robinhood just raised another $2.4 billion on top of their previous round, which is more than enough to clear DTC's collateral requirements. According to their own statements as of late, this was the primary reason why Robinhood restricted asset purchases in the first place. If you're willing to trust them on that, it means that we shall see a resurgence in volume from remaining Robinhood users in the coming days.

# Conclusions

Putting 1+2+3 together we get a potential recipe for another green EoW. Retail sentiment being positive can translate into higher volume once logistical bottlenecks are cleared and resume ass-ripping activities. HOWEVER, it is by NO MEANS guaranteed, and only the tippy top of the world know exactly what these mfs might pull off in the coming days. Get yourselves ready for either a positive or negative scenario this week / beginning of next.

GME to moon.

**ANOTHER EDIT:** Welcome to the end of the post. Im proud of you for making it this far in literacy class. I want to respond to all of your comments and questions but automod deletes all but a couple of them. Ill answer them as soon as they show up.

**UPDATE:** Ok automod deleted a bunch of negative feedback which is WRONG. Also some FAQs that got blocked. The questions were valid so heres the best I could do:

1Retail made no dent so what to expect now?

* I dont know what to expect. What I do know is that retail made no dent because of the bottlenecks mentioned in Exhibit C above.

2Should I buy now or what?

* I want you to make your own conclusion based on available evidence, not seek confirmation bias. I dont want to be liable for your money and neither does anyone else.

3Smart money is leaving and youll be left holding the bag

* I have yet to see credible evidence in either the trading volume, SEC reports, or formal announcements from any major institutional shareholder of GameStop that indicates theyre leaving. If you have this information please relay it to me (dont use comments, youll get blocked by bot). BlackRock had to adjust due to internal requirements AFAIK correct me if Im wrong
* **UPDATE**: this post shows that more instutitional shares flowed out than in. But, more funds bought in than exited. Make of that what you will. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laum38/for\_the\_scared\_little\_baby\_apestake\_a\_look\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laum38/for_the_scared_little_baby_apestake_a_look_for/)

4AMC?

* I have no data on AMC. You should do your own research and make a thread like this.

5When selling then?

* I have an emergency exit plan like everyone else should. I dont have the financial capability to let GME go to 0. Ill keep a small position post-exit just in case. Make an exit plan that aligns with what loss or gain you can stomach. Dont invest more than youre willing to lose. Nothing on this sub is financial advice. You dont have to sell if you can lose everything. Im probably liquidating my options and doing shares only until further trend confirmation.

Title: Are you going to Give Up? Or make the HF's realize they Fucked Up?
Why are you buying these shares? To stick it to Wall Street? To earn big? Maybe its a bit of both.

Youve invested, you might be in the red right now, you might want to minimize your losses, you might wonder whats going to happen if it sinks even lower. But you shouldnt ponder if's, you should be thinking about what is actually going to happen. And that my friend, is a big fucking rocket fucking itself through the moon and blowing up mars unleashing a rain of that sweet sweet Wall Street billionaire dollar dollar bill, and those bills now belong to you. 

They say its always darkest just before the sun rises. Fuck the sun. Where we are going we wont see no fucking sun, Were going so far away from this fucking planet that the only thing hotter than you is Gliese 581.

**"But the price is dropping!!! HOW WILL I BE ABLE TO EARN MONEY WHEN IT GOES NEGATIVE??????"**

Stocks are priced after **supply** and **demand.** 

If **supply** is **high** then price is **low**
If **demand** is **high** then price is **high**

But what if the **demand** was **high**, the supply was **low** and you, as someone whos **shorted** this stock, needed the **supply** to be **high** so price becomes **low**

Well...
What you could do is trick the system, it is illegal but you stand to lose a couple million in a lawsuit vs billions in your bad shorting of stocks.

So you hatch a plan. You and your hedgefund friends are going to use your own stocks that you own and trade them very very quickly with eachother at low low prices. The supply is still low, you guys are only trading a couple hundred or thousand stocks, but the system cant recognize that its the **same** stocks being traded. Its just seeing the **amount of times** the same stock is being traded. So one stock being moved 5 times the system sees as 5 different stocks, and therefore thinks the supply is **high**.

Thing is, this only drives the price down. It doesnt matter though, since you as someone who is **holding** isnt selling at that price. It doesnt MATTER what the price is if noone is selling. See, the price decrease because the same stocks are being traded constantly tricking the system into thinking its many different stocks being traded once, however since the price is too low for the people who are holding the other stocks they are not selling. The supply is still **low**.

Why is this important? Its important because the hedgefunds need to **BUY** your stocks to close their positions. They literally cannot close their shorts unless they buy **YOUR** stocks. This is why you are supposed to hold your stocks, no matter how low the price is. The price is a facade, they want you to sell at a price they are setting. If you are not selling even though the price is low, they cant buy. And if they cant buy they cant close their shorts. If they cant close their shorts they'll have to pay interest. And when the interest becomes too much they are going to be **FORCED** to buy **YOUR** stocks at whatever price **YOU** offer. This is the **squeeze**

The squeeze starts when the hedgefunds cant afford to trick the system anymore since the interest on their shorts are getting too much. Theyll have to pay whatever we ask of them. If noone sells untill 1000usd they are going to be forced to pay that, if noone sells until 10000usd theyll have to pay that amount instead. When they are forced to close their positions en masse they will **FLOOD** the marketplace with orders to buy. This is going to skyrocket the stocks, and the price will keep rising until people start selling. However if you sell during the short ladder attacks, the squeeze wont happen. The price set during the attacks isnt the actual price. Its a price thats tricked into the system. 

This is why you **HOLD** no matter how much the price goes down. if **everyone** holds there is no **supply** and if there is no **supply** it doesnt matter how low the price is **SINCE THERE IS LITERALLY NOONE FOR THE HEDGEFUNDS TO BUY FROM** so they cant close their positions, theyll have to keep paying interest, and at some point they will **HAVE** to **BUY YOUR STOCKS** no matter the **PRICE**.

https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml

Buy orders **(demand)** are more than sell orders **(supply)** and yet the stock lost value. 

This is why people are talking about **volume**. The **total amount** of stocks **(actual supply)** being traded is **low (price should increase)**, but **the total amount of times (percieved supply)** those same stocks are being traded is **high (price decreases)**.

You need to understand, it doesnt matter how low the price drops right now, the squeeze hasnt happened. the squeeze happens when the hedgefunds are **forced** to buy back. That is the squeeze, and it is what will skyrocket the stocks. Right now the hedgefunds are trying to prevent the squeeze.

So what are you going to do, give up? or capitalize on their fuck up? Every dollar the hedgefunds lose goes to us, but only so long as we own stocks. 

So **HOLD**, the price might drop but the rocket launches when the HF's are forced to buy back.

Title: THEY'RE USING ETFS TO FUEL THE SHORT LADDERS - Low Effort DD on $GME and Why No Squeeze
[deleted]

Title: Trading and Price Asymmetries on $GME
Good evening fellow Autists,

A great many of you who are participating in this sub are new to the community and many of you are new to trading/ finance altogether. I have been a long time lurker and have never worked up the courage to post anything of my own. After missing out on the SPY PUT option bonanza that occurred back in March/ April, I vowed I would be put myself in a position to capitalize on the next big thing. Fast forward to GME and while I was a little late to the party, I did get in with everything I could, and regardless of the outcome I have enjoyed myself and have learned more in the last two weeks than during any previous stretch.

Many of the comments on the daily threads center around the price of GME falling and wondering if now is the time to get out. It is common knowledge that we have been the victim of Short Ladder attacks, internal disinformation campaigns, external disinformation campaigns, market manipulation, and straight up suppression. Of specific interest to the neophytes in this community is why the low trading volume last week and especially today matter when the price starts to drop consistently and dramatically, especially during After-Hours trading. 

I pulled some Level II data from Robinhood detailing the AH trading volume and the corresponding price decrease. Between the hours of 4 PM EST and 5:55 PM EST, Robinhood shows a total of 475,690 shares traded. When compared to average volume and the corresponding price drop we arrive at the following:

**Shares Traded: 475,690**

**Average Volume: 106,230,000**

**Volume Percentage: 0.448%**

The closing price at 4 PM was $222.87 and the closing price at 5:55 PM was $176.77 meaning a share price decline of $46.10

During AH trading, GME share price fell **20.7%** on trading volume **0.448%** of the current average. THIS IS A MASSIVE ASYMMETRY and in my mind, it supports the idea that the establishment is suppressing this stock to continue scaring us all out of the market.

I rewatched "The Big Short" this afternoon and it was funny to me that in that situation, no one and I mean NO ONE thought any of those guys were right. And when it turned out they were in fact correct, the banks LIED and CONCEALED the true value of the shorts UNTIL they were able to put themselves in a position to try and make money off of the problem they themselves created. Friends, it feels like we are in the same kind of endgame now and I ask that everyone remain diamond-handed and patient. The math is on our side and if it doesn't work out it's because they found a way to cheat and screw us before we knew what they were doing.

Title: Most of the world does not yet realize how big this situation is.
First of all, the point of this post is not to tell you how high I think GME will go. This is about how this squeeze is going to affect history.

All of this short squeeze business is nothing more than a numbers game. Weve been hearing price targets from $1k to $100k, with $100k being considered outlandishly high.

Yes, its a lot of money, but this situation boils down to nothing more than a math problem. Math does not care if its a lot of money.

So lets look at some numbers. The most similar event we have ever seen in history is the VW squeeze. This was caused by hedge funds owing a short interest of **12%** and Porsche buying up **43%** of the float. VW became the most valuable company in the world, which in GMEs case would put it at $30,000 per share.

As we all know, GME was shorted 140%. And Im willing to bet that us  are currently holding well over 43% of the float, with no intention of letting go.

I dont need a phd to tell you what that means for GME.

So lets say GME hits $100k, which if you look at the numbers, is a massively conservative estimate.

The hedge funds are dying at $300. At $100k they are going to have to liquidate every asset in their possession to cover their shorts. All their stocks other than GME will be sold. This means the rest of the market is going to plummet. I estimate that march 2020 will look like a joke. The hedge funds will have no way to cover, and someone is going to have to bail them out. **Our economy is about to collapse.**

The hedge funds know this. Why do you think they are so long on Silver and Gold? Precious metals perform well during recessions. 

Andddd because this is WSB, here are my positions:
- GME shares
- SPY 374p 2/5
- SPY 300p 3/1
- SPY 250p 3/1
- UVXY 14c 3/1
- not a single SLV call or share because fuck the hedge funds

TLDR: 

Edit:
To those of you saying Im making up numbers:

[VW was shorted 12% and Porsche bought 43%](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/heres-how-the-gamestop-short-squeeze-is-like-the-vw-squeeze-of-2008/ar-BB1d9yVI) 

GME as most valuable company in the world: $2.25T/69.5M = $32,375

I used $100k as a lower bounds for the price because we can assume a 10x higher short percent would create more than a 10x higher price, so multiplying by 3 is a safe lower bound.

Title: GME/AMC Failure to Delivers VS Price (Attn: SEC Interns)
So some of you have noticed that the SEC publishes data for failure to deliver numbers for each symbol every day.  

After reading this post by u/johnnydaggers
https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/ , I got curious if this theory had legs.

I downloaded all the data for the last 10 years, and charted the daily FTD's vs Price action.  It yields some interesting results:

EDIT: Blue lines are # total collective failures on that date, green line is closing price 

GME: https://i.imgur.com/dvqlgib.png 

AMC: https://i.imgur.com/OLymQ4j.png

For both these stocks the failure to delivers are off the charts in recent history, and those increases in failures seem to correlate with suppressed pricing.  Now there may be legit reasons for a failure to happen, and without knowing which firms caused these failures we can't truly draw any conclusions other than *something is fucky*.


We can pretty easily generate a corresponding chart for any symbol with this:

GM: https://i.imgur.com/7d96w7B.png

Now IF these failures are coming from a handful of firms (SEC / DTCC should have that data..), I would say it is quite evident of intentional naked selling to manipulate the markets.  But ~~I'm not an expert~~ _I am a smoothbrained retard ape_ and would love to hear from anyone who understands this better than I do.

Title: Fubo stock on track to hit $200
Over the past few weeks, fuboTV has been caught up in the huge short-squeeze rattling through the markets because, well, the stock is one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the market.

In the first half of December, fuboTVs stock more than doubled over two weeks on the back of super-strong subscriber numbers. The strength in fuboTVs subscriber base broadly foreshadows its huge role in the live TV streaming world.

On the heels of that huge rally, multiple short-sellers targeted FUBO. The favored argument amongst bears is that demand for live TV is dying, the streaming platform itself is commoditized and the business model is built on broken economics. Fubos short interest currently sits at about 65% of the float.

Then, the Reddit-inspired short-squeeze broke out. It wasnt just GME stock that went flying. All heavily shorted stocks flew alongside GME stock. FUBO stock, with 65% of its float sold short, was a beneficiary of the rising tide in heavily shorted names.

But, this week, many of these short squeeze stocks have plunged.

Not FUBO stock  and thats because fuboTV is no GameStop or AMC.

## Unlike GameStop, fuboTV Is Fundamentally Strong

FuboTV  unlike many of the other heavily shorted companies that soared last week  is supported by very strong fundamentals and has a long runway for profitable growth ahead.

Heres the story.

Media consumption is pivoting from linear TV to streaming TV because the latter is cheaper, more flexible, and more convenient. Yet, even though **Netflix** has reached ubiquity among U.S. households, most households still pay for cable TV, because Netflix doesnt have live sports, live programming or news  three things which Americans still love to watch.

Thats why a new generation of live TV streaming services has emerged over the past decade. These services take live TV content, and package it into a streaming service  somewhat like a Netflix for TV. Because demand for live TV is robust and because streaming TV offers significant advantages over linear TV, these live TV streaming services represent the future of TV and will one day be as commonplace in households as cable TV is today.

fuboTV is one of these live TV streaming services. Its differentiation is that it is a sports-focused live TV streaming platform. That is, the company is hyper-focused on acquiring exclusive sports content and launching a digital sportsbook to enable dynamic sports betting through its live TV streaming platform.

In other words, fuboTV projects as a live TV streaming service purpose-built for sports super-fans and gamblers.

Thats a large audience. About 70% of Americans classify themselves as sports fans. Around 60% have gambled in the past year. That number is only growing with online sports betting becoming legal in more and more states.

Thus, fuboTV projects as a streaming platform that will one day have tens of millions of paid subscribers. It has just 500,000 paid subs today.

The runway for growth here is very long  and consequently, the potential upside in FUBO stock is very big.

## FuboTV Stock to $200?

My numbers indicate that FUBO stock will soar to $200 over the next several years.

Here are those numbers.

I broadly assume that fuboTV can scale to \~10 million paid subscribers by 2030. I think that average revenue per subscriber per month can grow to about $70, assisted by ad revenue growth and sports betting revenue growth. That implies around $8.4 billion in 2030 revenues for fuboTV.

I see EBITDA margins running towards 20%, as ad revenue and sports betting revenue add higher-margin revenue firepower into the business model and boost margins.

Assuming so, my modeling suggests fuboTV is on track to do about $10 in earnings per share by 2030.

Based on a 20X multiple, that implies a long-term price target for FUBO stock of $200.

## Bottom Line on FUBO Stock

Not all short squeeze stocks are created equal. On one hand, you have GME stock and AMC stock, who have tons of short squeeze firepower but very weak fundamentals. On the other hand, you have FUBO stock, who has almost as much short-squeeze firepower and strong fundamentals, too.

Thats a powerful combination which should sustain the current uptrend in FUBO stock not just for the next few days  but for the next few years, as well.

Title: $TLRY DD
Hello Everyone.

With growth in revenue and net income, EPS have also increased q/q which is a great sign for investors. With US legalization on the horizon and expansion into EU markets, it hard to believe that $TLRY isn't headed up from here. Which should lead to a squeeze on the 50% short when they are forced to cover.

**TLDR; $TLRY has improving technical, balance sheets and is expanding into newer markets. With legalization in US on the horizon, its hard to believe that the 50% shorts wont be squeezed.**

Title: ROBINHOOD IS A CHICKEN
This is my theory and analysis by autist.  


1. On Wednesday, Hedge fund saw that they might go belly up and lose the billions. The only solution they saw was to restrict retail traders, who trade on Robinhood overwhelmingly. They asked in whispers IF Robinhood should put restrictions on these stocks. The reason can be formulated by the team of lawyers later. They knew very well this will upset the retail traders and might create an exodus of retail customers from Robinhood.
2. Hedge funds have few hundreds of millions in investment in Robinhood. HF realized it's okay to lose millions and save billions. HF might lose everything if the stocks ($GME etc.) continue to the ride to the moon. Hence the blockade.

This is a classic example of when Robinhood could stand up for us to the bullies and say

 TIMES UP ITS TIME FOR DEMOCRATIZATION

 But they didn't and here we are.

&amp;#x200B;

I am moving everything out of Robinhood and I want them to go belly up. That will be my sweet revenge.

At this point, 

IF I LOSE OR WIN, DOESN'T MATTER. I WANT ROBINHOOD TO BE GONE FOREVER.

Title: **At least** 49% of all trades from 3.30-4.00 havent been made by Retail!
So i had my little Michael Burry moment or i am just a stupid ape, but ive ["read" all trades between 3.30-4.00pm](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades) made today (4060 in total). Thank god its just numbers!

As ive been sitting today from market opening and looking at [numbers like this](https://imgur.com/a/420z1fN) for hours on end having my small Rainman moment, ive noticed that a lot of those trades had 3 or 4 decimals, which indicates that those trades couldnt have been done by us retards.

Anyways, 1989 trades made between 3.30-4.00 p.m today had 3/4 decimals which tells us that at least **48,99%** couldnt have been made by retail. Also not every Fund will buy/sell with 3/4 decimals, so we can probably assume the number to be higher.

Well i dont know shit about shit, but it still looks like we are holding strong and they are just still postponing the inevitable. 

So boys  12.45 @ 123.34

Title: Why short squeeze in $slv would never work. You are being manipulated by wall st banks and hedge funds if you buy silver because you think 'wsb' has set its sights on slv for a short squeeze. The media is lying to help their hedge fund friends.
Why short squeeze in $slv would never work. You are being manipulated by wall st banks and hedge funds if you buy silver because you think 'wsb' has set its sights on slv for a short squeeze. The media is lying to help their hedge fund friends. 


Slv etf is not like other stocks. They can create and retire shares at will.

The way it works is authorized investors are able to buy baskets of 50k shares in exchange for the equivalent delivery of silver bullion. 

This delivery to the slv trust creates shares. 

These authorized participants can also buy 50k shares and retire them in exchange for silver bullion withdrawal.

If the etf becomes over valued, an authorized participant can buy silver on the open market (or go to their vault where they have the physical silver purchased already at a lower price) and deliver it to slv trust to receive 50k shares which they can then sell at the over valued market price risk free Arbitrage. 

It seems like some hedge fund is trying to unload silver in mass and is using the hype around wsb as a Catalyst for a price run-up.

Not investment advice.

Title: Alright everyone, iv been patiently waiting for this GME ride to end so I could post this CRSR dd. It's time. Get on board the hype train.
They are currently 81% shorted and are a solid company. Earnings coming soon. Whole market down and just a handful of stocks green from last week...Corsair (CRSR) one of them

They've been trying to short corsair and keep it locked in for weeks. Probably to buy before earnings cheap. They deserve the real boost before earnings. I will admit if it goes up it would benefit me, but I also have been watching them short this for months and it's making me sick.

Title: Technical Analysis of GME and Reality Check
Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, and nor am I writing this as financial advice. This is simply my perspective as an options trader on the current situation with GME. Many of you will hate my perspective. You will call me a (insert rainbow + bear emoji (I am write these on word so yeah)), you will tell me to fuck off and drag me through the mud. But all I am trying to do here is provide this growing community with some original and well thought out due diligence and research on a very popular invesment that many of you have sunk your life savings into. And sometimes you have to go against the grain to help a community see a different perspective. 

I also want to say that I am extremely proud of this sub. This sub has done something that no other sub has done on reddit or any social media platform for that matter. However, this is a sub that was built on Due Diligence, Degenerate Trading, and Crazy Gains and Loss Porn. And to see this sub shine a light on a clearly broken system is something to be truly proud of. 

However, the time may have come to realize that we were indeed robbed of the MOASS. Which it absolutely tears me up inside to say so. This was going to be by far one of the greater events to occur in the history of assets management and trading. I for one was loaded to the hilt in call options and ready to rumble just like many of you. And like many of you I made multiples of my salary within the first few weeks of January, it is life changing money. 

There is an old saying in the industry and within trading, that you Ride the trade, until it doesnt make sense anymore. And I am afraid to that we could either be fast approaching this or have even passed it at this point. So below you will find my technical analysis on GME and why I feel like it might continue its downward trend. This is of course is subject to change, and just my observations. I hope this helps some with a better understanding of what is going on and how to read the charts (Technical Analysis). 

My Technical Analysis approach: I am an intermediate term momentum trader. This simply means that I am trying to trade for the next 5-15 days. The tools I use are the following:

 RSI: Measures the strength of the movement or the strength of the momentum.

 MACD: This is trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securitys price, and helps you understand the momentum of a stock

 Volume: Speaks for itself

 MVWAP &amp; SMA: Helps Identify intermediate term trend and takes into consideration by comparing to shorter-term trend. (MVWAP: Pink Line, SMA: Teal Line)

I usually use a mix of the 15 &amp; 30 Minute chart paired with the 1 Hour to identify patterns within the market.

Chart (A): Below you will find the 15-minute chart, that spreads over the past five days of trading. Each data point represents a 15-minute segment of trading. The Black shaded areas represent the trading session and the grey shaded area represent pre-market and after-hours trading. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Chart \(A\) 15 minute intervals](https://preview.redd.it/lay0kxbpdye61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0639aa416de5f96a4228d5e8b4cb7fa3b5c3d973)

Tuesday of Chart(A) shows extremely bullish pattern being built late Tuesday afternoon and continued into the afterhours. This was the culmination of Papa Elon, and Camath chipping in their two cents on twitter, along with a clear series of purchases by institutional buyers (This very well could have been Melvin and the early shorts covering their positions). Additionally we can see that the VWAP and SMA are diverging further apart (Bulllish). The MACD is showing the same as well, with the Histogram showing no signs of slowing down as well (Bullish). And despite an onslaught of short attacks and put ladders during trading on Wednesday we still managed to end the day Green. However, we can see that the volume drove itself right off a cliff, and we all know what happened there after. 

Ever since the security price has shown an increased amount of volatility and the bid / ask spread continues to widen throughout every trading session. Clearly the market makers are not doing their job in creating a market for the stock and/or there is blatant fuckery going on behind the scenes. Either way it does spell bad news for the underlying security. 

Furthermore, we can see that during the Thursday trading session that three bearish events occur; 1) the MVWAP and SMA begin to diverge, 2)MACD Plummets with a bearish signal line crossover, and 3) The RSI Plummets to sold territory as well. 

To further support my hypothesis, I have included the 1 Hour chart as well

&amp;#x200B;

[Chart \(B\) 1 Hour Trading Intervals](https://preview.redd.it/3gt2em3rdye61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbe04b217967c20a258e4e9ad1606ee6ec3dbed0)

As we can see above the same sort of patterns that developed in the short term are now present in the long term (1 hour Chart). Only this time we can see how the patterns are drawn out over a longer period (1 hour intervals), and thus it may give us a better sense of where we might be heading. At this time, we can see that the MVWAP and SMA have tapered out and are possibly at the beginning stages of divergence. That the RSI has neared oversold territory (anything below 30 is considered oversold). And finally, the longer term MACD is showing that the momentum is being carried to the downside.  

As I said earlier, You ride the trade until it doesnt make sense anymore. And based off my research I can no longer say that it makes sense to be positioned for the upside. Which is why on Friday I started to trim most of my positions in GME, it simply made no more sense to me to remain on the bullish side of this security. Today I trimmed the remaining bits and will be walking away from GME at this time. 

I hope I am wrong. I hope this stock can reverse and we can go back to the fucking moon. I would be more than happy to dump a bunch of money to help build another Gamma Ramp. But right now, from my point of view that is not where we are.

Again, these are just my observations and I know a lot of you will find this offensive. But if you are going to trade or invest, you have to remove your emotions from the picture. Be a fucking robot. 

For those that are going to ask the trading platform I use is Think or Swim. 

Positions: No Calls left in the hopper, only shares about 1500 @ $19.

Title: GME -- S3 Partners  HEDGE FUNDS
The CEO of S3 Partners Bob Sloan who reported that short interest in GME went down by nearly 80% over the weekend **LOVES HEDGE FUNDS.**

His book **Don't Blame the Shorts** demonstrates his position to protect Hedge Funds.

The golden age for hedge funds is gone, but its still three times more lucrative than working at a mutual fund and most other places on Wall Street, said Robert Sloan, managing partner of S3 Partners, a hedge fund risk management firm. But this shouldnt pop up on the greed meter. They made money. Thats what theyre supposed to.

"While other authors point accusing fingers, in his book, Don't Blame the Shorts, Robert Sloan leaps to the defense of short sellers..."

We know who's side this  is on.

I'm an autistic ape with  and  that can **HOLD**

**APES TOGETHER STRONG**

Title: The case for $WISH
For transparency, I am long on WISH stock. I am also not a financial advisor.

Context Logic Inc, ticker WISH, is a stable, competitive alternative to Ali-Express, that has (since IPO) seen a steady incline despite market fluctuations. 

With record unemployment: [https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/10/business/unemployment-long-term-pandemic/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/10/business/unemployment-long-term-pandemic/index.html)

And Biden's plan to "buy American" paired with a new, stirred sense of patriotism amongst the lower to middle class, there is going to be an overwhelming influx of cheap, low cost, alternative household and every day goods. Now you're thinking, why don't they just go to amazon? Amazon's prices would be preferred had we not been in the midst of a pandemic and economic recession. The alternative to going broke is budgeting effectively, and we do that by slapping on the American brand name over cheap overseas goods. Does it matter where it was made if its from an American company? The vast majority of people wouldn't bother checking or caring.

Improving free cash flow in 2020 compared to 2019? Check. Monthly active user growth rising nicely? Yes. Active buyers up compared to the year-ago period? Yep.

After a significantly underperforming IPO, in my humble opinion, the company is a 6-8 bagger by EOY.

Position: long 300 shares @ 18.60

Title: I PUT EVERYTHING I HAVE (AND MORE) INTO GME, AMC, NAKD, DOG-E.
This is a message to everyone that is contemplating selling or already has sold.

I just turned 27 last week right when this all started and for my birthday I got a knife in the back from Vlad Tenev, Robinhood and the suits. 

I almost didnt go to school because of money struggles growing up. It took me six years to get my bachelors degree: first community college then transferred to a university. I graduated two years ago and Ive been struggling to find a stable job and Covid did not help. I went through many interviews this year, but was denied over and over or positions were dissolved mid-way through the hiring process because of company redirection. It has really sucked, and Im sure many of you have gone through same thing. 

For nearly 2 months I was hovering around $100 in bank account and doing grub-hub to pay for my bills. In October I started working in a distribution center...busting my ass until I get a career role. Fortunately, I am in another interview process for an awesome company and position.

I know its irresponsible of me to throw everything Ive made over the past few months into these companies. But I believe in what is happening and this community. This is bigger than money. What the suits have done is unforgivable. Although I am still up pretty well, it does look bad right now, but we still dont know whats gonna happen. Ive come to terms with the potential loss and all the work Ive done to get here, but I am HOLDING.

I have been in way worse financial positions and Ive always made it out. Robinhood chose not to do what was right. I will be okay and you will be okay. 

Do what you must.
Money will come and go. See this through.
Keep those diamond hands.

This is not financial advice I just like the stock and love you all. 



Title: $BGS SHORT SQUEEZE
Guys, continue to hold all your positions but I think theres a good case for a lot of money to be made if we consider $BGS. Here are some metrics:

 Price: ~$37
 Forward P/E: 16.42 (industry avg: 20.43)
 ~37%+ of float shorted and growing
 Dividend yield: 5% (#1 reason HFs are short is because they dont think this is sustainable but theyve paid for 65+ quarters in a row and the yield has been higher)
 Cheap OTM calls available (2/19 exp.)
 Stock up ~45% in the past month
 EPS expected to be up 57% y-o-y
 Quarterly Rev expected up 11.8% y-o-y

Odds are youve probably enjoyed some of their Green Giant, Crisco, Cream of Wheat, Mrs. Dash, Ortega, Emerils, Grandmas Molasses, Snackwells, Weber, and many more. Lets stick it to the HFs because we really like these brands and we really like this stock.

Title: $FEYE Long and their earning come out tomorrow.
FireEye mainly does incident response which is when a company gets hacked and they want someone to come and figure out what happened so it doesn't happen again. 

FireEye has the best incidence response for cyber attacks in the USA and were contracted heavily during the SolarWinds attack tens to hundreds of companies last quarter. They have seen some rougher quarters while dealing with debt and company reorganizations. They should post above expected earning this quarter which are released tomorrow after hours. Call options don't have crazy premiums right now especially for the ones expiring end of the week. (Feb 12 exp, 24 strike for $0.94 right now). I think this can come close to 30 by end of next week. 

Cybersecurity is becoming more valuable and WS is catching on. Incident response, a part of cybersecurity uses multiple technologies and does not get outdated as it is the process of figuring out how an entity was attacked and doing remediation's on that. This puts FireEye in a great spot to continue gaining business in this growing sector. 

I'm long here and have call options for this Friday. (strike of 21 for $1.20 - now 1.70)

Title: Twinkies for Tendies: Long Thesis on Hostess Brands (TWNK) (Owner of Twinkies)
# TL;DR

**Hostess Brands (TWNK)** has high (\~15%) short interest (more than AMC or BB) setting the stage for a short squeeze, additional upside from a gamma squeeze, is extremely memeable, AND has a fundamentally sound business with strong cash flows and organic growth trading at a reasonable valuation. ***Not intended to distract from HOLDING THE LINE ON GME. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade.***

Twinkies to the moon: [https://imgur.com/a/sUYpaue](https://imgur.com/a/sUYpaue)

# Intro

Sup guys. So I know a bunch of us are now looking for the next big opportunity to pile into. Unfortunately we probably wont see a squeeze of GMEs magnitude for awhile since that kind of short interest is insanely rare, but I think we might have found an opportunity that is pretty low hanging fruit AND is significantly better relative value than the other names people are piling into. It has what the finance community call asymmetric upside (more upside potential than downside risk), for the reasons Ill describe below.

**So whats the target?** ***Hostess Brands (NASDAQ: TWNK)***. You probably know them as the company that makes Twinkies, but they also make Cupcakes, DingDongs, HoHos, Donettes and Zingers (cant make this up)now theyre going to make us some Tendies as well.

For some historical context, the company was private-equity owned for awhile and then went public via a SPAC in 2016 (before SPAC's were as cool as they are today). The previous owners have fully sold out now, so the entire shares outstanding are pretty much public float today and theres no more downward pressure on the stock price from their share sales.

The company also has warrants from the SPAC (effectively long-dated call options) that trade under TWNKW. They trade as half warrants, so need two warrants to form one share and are ITM at $11.50 per one full share and expire in November 2021.

**So whats the thesis?** We think theres an opportunity to wring out the short sellers in this name and potentially even further upside from a gamma squeeze if we can get enough call option volume. From a fundamental standpoint, the business is extremely stable (as it was a pretty ideal candidate for an LBO), and trades at a slight discount to its peers.

# Technical Thesis

1. **High short interest = squeeze opportunity**  Roughly 15% short interest today, higher than AMC which is last reported at 10-15% (see end of post for reference) and BB at 5-10%. This seems low in comparison to GME, but again this company has no structural problems that were aware of (cant really say the same for movie theaters or mall-based retailers right now) and has actually been performing pretty well. Also, anything above 20% short interest is considered pretty high in the normal world. This level of short interest on a solid business smells like opportunity to squeeze out a couple of greedy hedge funds.
2. **Limited liquidity and trading volume will make it difficult for shorts to cover**  Average 3-month daily trading volume of 1.4mm shares (roughly 1% of the float). It would take about *13+ DAYS* for the shorts to fully cover if they were to buy up all the average daily trading volume. Current $2bn market cap is also in the perfect sweet spot for the WSB pool of capital (especially since many of us have our tendies tied up in GME right now). If youre looking for a bit of tendie diversification, this is the name.
3. **The potential for a Gamma squeeze is all further upside**  Theres actually been option activity picking up on this company. ***On Friday, Nasdaq reported that call options for 2.6mm of underlying shares traded hands on TWNK. This is with limited mention of TWNK online thus far (based on my keyword search through reddit)****.* See [this report](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-friday-option-activity%3A-twnk-wdc-nvcr-2021-01-29). Most of those options were sold OTM at the $17.50 strike price. Things are moving quick here and we might not be the only ones that have sniffed out this opportunity. In order to create the biggest upside, buying the highest strike call option is ideal. As the price moves closer to ITM on those options, the market makers will have to buy more shares to hedge. The IV is still really low on this name.

# Fundamental Thesis

1. **Snacking continues to be king.** Large market, resilient, growing. 95% of U.S. adults snack daily, and the average American snacks 3x-5x per day. The snacking category generates \~$150bn in annual sales and is expected to continue growing mid-single-digits driven by the need for convenience as consumers (at least pre-COVID-19) are busier than ever. Lots of room for multiple winners in the industry, of which I think Hostess will continue to be one.
2. **Strong organic growth story**. Organic sales have grown \~6% per year on average over the last number of years. Hostess Brands is growing  and likely gaining share.
3. **Strong brand value and nostalgia factor with millennials.** Some of you might be old enough to remember this but during 2012, when the company filed for bankruptcy (due to the heavy debt burden from its buyout), consumers freaked out that the company would discontinue production of their beloved Twinkies, triggering a mad scramble to buy up all available supply of Twinkies. ***At the peak Twinkies sold on Ebay for $22,000 (see article*** [***here***](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/11/on-ebay-the-starting-bid-for-a-single-twinkie-is-now-5-000/265346/)***).***
4. **The acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 rides the healthy snack trend.** Voortman sells crme wafers and sugar free cookies (new product categories for Hostess), and markets as having no artificial colors, no artificial flavors, no high-fructose corn syrup, and no trans-fat (playing the better-for-you snack trend). Voortman is one of the fastest growing independent sweet snacking brands of scale in North America, and should be able to accelerate growth by leveraging Hostess existing distribution footprint.
5. **COVID-19 re-opening should drive a bounce-back in convenience store traffic, which is the companys primary sales channel and may also increase demand as consumers become busy again (and thus snack more).** Management plans to keep growing within the convenience store channel, which is a growing end-market and should rebound as the world re-opens. As consumers get back to their busy pre-COVID-19 lives, they may also go back to snacking more out of convenience.

# Potential Risks

1. **Changing consumer preferences, especially to healthy.** The recent acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 allows Hostess to further capitalize on the healthy trend.
2. **Pretty high leverage for a public company.** They have roughly $950mm of net debt, or \~4x leverage on Adj. EBITDA (Adj. EBITDA is a proxy for cash flow). This is pretty high leverage for a public company (but quite low in private equity land). Leverage increased to \~4.5x in the beginning of 2020 after the acquisition of Voortman Cookies (up from \~3.4x before the acquisition), but has steadily declined to \~4x today as Adj. EBITDA has grown. Given their cash flow profile, would not be surprised to see them continue to deleverage.
3. **Customer concentration.** The Companys largest customer is Walmart, which was \~24% of sales. Top ten customers accounted for \~62% of sales in 2019. Some risk with customer concentration, but Hostess Brands is such a well-known and entrenched brand that I dont think retail stores will do anything irrational.
4. **Rebound of COVID-19.** Risk that COVID-19 cases rise again, possibly hurting traffic and sales through retail stores, increasing costs, or causing supply chain disruptions. On the flip side, the snack category seems to have held steady from consumers staying at home and snacking more.

# Conclusion

If youre looking for a little tendie diversification or finding the next oversold stock, look no further. This stacks up as a much better opportunity than AMC or BB given the higher short interest and more stable business fundamentals. Also, we can also potentially create even more upside with a gamma squeeze if we are able to buy more call options at the high strike prices.

***Again, this is not intended to distract from HOLDING THE LINE ON GME. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade (and hopefully does not require much capital). Bringing this to your attention now before it starts to trade away from us or before the hedge funds exit their shorts. More than happy to hear any feedback from you guys.***

Title: A letter from Robin Hood: More wishy-washy explanation: Let RH go broke
A note from Robinhood,  


We wanted to reach out to you after a transformative week in the markets to answer a question we know many of you are asking: Why did Robinhood limit certain stocks?  


We understand that the temporary limits we placed on certain stocks this past week were frustrating for many, especially since we built Robinhood to expand access to investing. We have always sought to put our customers first and we want you to be able to invest on your own terms.  


To help explain what happened and why we had to take action, we wrote [**a letter to our customers**](http://sg.robinhood.com/ls/click?upn=6fntGirSE5selsQKrSSUHh6lgFyOgotlCTJW8UC1di71-2FN8W9HLDeGxWC4U5aEavH91h1h75nfEoi40O-2BJp241os1OXbwqcvqJ1wx8fRtdZa4yPHJd3VaV9ZmuiW1Y8kIkOs_0QWL-2FCUCqlU7jIqxpPSB9OxM9FRLms8ed02eETm0XmLyPxEEZ9Yx1osF-2F2Olc0X95ijU64uSuhF1vPTW00ASBRnRYzE5nDEQo9kVCzyEPt6JRUURrNQwUEmhfgeIfRCW86mSXVtX2-2BS9LhHDNVmjdC8lpjCulKPt7v9hOTXzII645jTe2IqLIFCc-2BmHCi-2BVQ0W0yUI6HviMaE33-2BukVQvcPGCCZWjFtJsTSMS75-2BCmQbOmWbm8feSSdfOQpH08fSwx12NTBbXE46HOsa1cV-2F8j-2FJeCqDt-2BXbwuLJgrJb24pZiEuECgjY5seWaf5QttGF) and captured the key understandings for you below:

* For Robinhood to operate, we must meet clearinghouse deposit requirements to support customer trades.
* Deposit requirements are determined in part by how much stock a firms customers hold. If a firms customers holdings are volatile, a broker (in this instance Robinhood) is obligated to meet higher deposit requirements.
* Last week, in part due to [**volatility**](http://sg.robinhood.com/ls/click?upn=6fntGirSE5selsQKrSSUHmU2zwU4-2BFOOGZok1-2F2HV-2Fzt4c20N8xojDAhUgt8a3TK7RBIb22WdVUS4CSdTwvVnbL52f-2Bl-2B207nVUod7i4WaLCWuNNQ0d6ZEsoYQX1fJMiDjMpPyfpE5mx0X2MvnOeoHr6A6U-2FzwqHV0iErJeKPLQ-3DnV5W_0QWL-2FCUCqlU7jIqxpPSB9OxM9FRLms8ed02eETm0XmLyPxEEZ9Yx1osF-2F2Olc0X9VYayMHndG9bc69FjYlFlBsnTLvcEmpwFADktwS-2FAiCthQb5eIXGICHKIXTUooIxlznBo2QuHSt5fTyQSM3bWTvOlnZ5Rw0HejdBRUuBqCDvGDfDHVW2FT32HtCv3394-2BPZT3FpK3djP6sjWKPDsfK-2FuGZEQcZOAkV7VomUXBokliAnU4rdpoYGDbxHrKZD8NZbgtcmYBc9NKzZWO4dxsyP4nguFNZ-2BMW8EJK39Dh6Rf2xHhOpvmykRfeKuPL-2BnQU) in some popular stocks, Robinhoods deposit requirements rose tenfold. The combination of the deposit increase and the extraordinary increase in volume on these particular symbols led us to put temporary buying restrictions in place on a small number of those stocks.
* We had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile stocks to ensure we could comfortably meet our deposit obligations. **We didnt want to stop people from buying stocks and we certainly werent trying to help hedge funds**.

We hope you take away this: **at Robinhood, we stand with everyday investors participating in the markets**. Standing by our Robinhood community means being there for our customers through any trading environment. Well continue to improve as we break down barriers in the financial system to open it for all.  


Thank you for being a part of the Robinhood community.Sincerely,  
The Robinhood Team

Title: GME Fails-to-Deliver Trending Downward
NOTE: The most recent data is January 15th.

I was reading /u/johnnydaggers's post and wanted to mine the data myself a little. So being the sentient I am I downloaded the SEC's fails to deliver reports and looked up GameStop and read it into an R script. The source is:

    library(dplyr)
    x1 &lt;- read.csv(cnsfails202012a.txt, sep="|")
    x2 &lt;- read.csv(cnsfails202012b.txt, sep="|")
    x3 &lt;- read.csv(cnsfails202101a.txt, sep="|")
    x &lt;- rbind(x1, x2, x3)

    failtd &lt;- arrange(x, desc(QUANTITY..FAILS.), desc(SETTLEMENT.DATE))
    gme &lt;- failtd[failtd$SYMBOL == "GME",] %&gt;% arrange(SETTLEMENT.DATE)
    mean(df$QUANTITY..FAILS., na.rm=TRUE)
    plot(as.Date(gme$SETTLEMENT.DATE, "%Y%m%d"), gme$QUANTITY..FAILS.)

And this gives [this plot](https://imgur.com/QRm64tw)

Here we see a trending downward from a rather ludicrious 1.7 million to 650,000 FTDs. Each point is the cumulative value.

Can anyone with a brain tell me what this means?

Title: Some proper DD to explain why $NOK isn't a bot stock and you should actually pay attention to it. 
I've been reading a lot of you posting about the fact that $NOK is a bot stock and that it's being posted to distract people from $GME.

Many people don't seem to realize it, but no smart investors put all their eggs into one basket.

I've got multiple large bets going at any given time, this way, if one doesn't work out, I can always bank on another one.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, here's why I decided to put 100k into $NOK.

*This is not financial advice, do your own DD.*

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start with financials:

The company has been working to grow FCF (Free cash flow) for the past couple of years and have delivered 5 quarters of positive FCF so far. Expected to continue this quarter.

Their operating margins have improved from breakeven in 2018 to just over 9% in 2020.

They are siting on a total cash balance of **over 8 billion dollars.**

The market cap is 23 billion dollars. To put this in perspective. You're paying 4.90$ per share for 1.92$ in Cash + Nokia's assets.

The company's expected to reinstate their dividend.

We're paying \~1x sales to buy the company.

The board is authorized to issue or buy back up to 10% of the float. They have done neither.

&amp;#x200B;

**The other reasons:**

The Covid pandemic has actually accellerated spending on 5G infrastructure. $NOK and Ericsson have been large beneficiaries of this due to the security risks related to Huauei.

$NOK's reefshark chips help carriers reduce their costs (power demand is 64% lower for example). This has helped them sell more of their products, but they don't expect full adoption until 2022.

$NOK's been investing their money into R&amp;D as well as into turning things around. They aren't just sitting on the side, they are working to become a major player again.

Total addressable market for this is expected to be $700 billion by 2030. It's currently $10 billion.

This is a 70x increase in addressable market, for which there are only a few major players.

**The biggest risk:** Huauei is unbanned from use in the US.

 

**TLDR:** 

My positions: 20k shares, with an average cost of about 4.75$. I will be selling weekly covered calls at varying strikes, to take advantage of the high IV. I'm happy to be paid to wait.

Title: GME long term story the media won't tell you. MUST READ!!!
Full Disclosure:  I am long 4600 shares since May 2020 and have not sold a single one.

The media is intentionally leaving out all the positive transformation information that is going on inside Game Stop.  What am I talking about you might ask.  Let me ask everyone this:  If there was a company that was experiencing 300% yoy ecommerce growth, closing unprofitable stores, start of a new console cycle, heading into a 200 billion TAM computer gaming industry and oh yeah, three new board members including Ryan Cohen would you say, "Hey this company has a great future?"   I'm pretty sure most investors would.

I know  everyone is looking for the big squeeze and you fucking retarded apes have done fantastic holding the line, however, there is a great long term story about to unfold here.  The current tradeable float is probably less than 10 million shares, more than likely closer to 5 million.  The institutions own over 100% and the current BUY AND HOLD strategy is working like a charm.  The hedge funds, market makers and brokerages have engaged in criminal activity to hold the stock down.  My point is, the company and Cohen hasn't said a word due to earnings coming up 3/25/21.  Just think what the stock might do if/when CEO Sherman steps aside and they announce Cohen as CEO.  Then Cohen announces his plan of how he's going to transform the company.  This is why I haven't sold along with the fact that I'm just a retarded ape like everyone else, but I really just like the stock.

Moral of the story is JUST BUY AND HOLD and good things are in our future.

Title: What is going on with GME

Title: Do not fucking flinch - just advice.
Listen up, do not flinch. The price currently does not matter AT ALL - if anything, this is a plus. Just buy and diamond hand this. Citadel is currently hurting and desperate including other big firms shorting GME (keep in mind some big whales are still holding stocks for GME). What we saw today was the most obvious attempt at ping ponging the stocks between the shorters causing the price to fall even at such low volumes - Almost a disgrace to call this a volume, as it was almost no volume. Check out [tradingview.com](https://tradingview.com) for example.  The price is not reflective of the situation at all. And remember, why are all these things happening?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Tons of bots promoting anything other than GME.

\- Tons of news saying WSB was responsible for a surge in SLV and an apparent squeeze which will NEVER happen. Citadel holdst the 6th most shares in SLV.

\- Tons of TV-news reporting the same

\- The stock being sold way undervalue between hedge funds that have shorted the stock by over 110%.

\- Portraying us as lazy, greedy,  irrational and Alt-right people promoting GME

&amp;#x200B;

Do not fucking flinch. This was the most transparent the hedge funds has ever been by showing blatantly that they are naked-short selling and spam ping ponging the stocks. Fuck the funds and fuck the SEC. This is fucking it. Holding till 0 even though that is not possible.

&amp;#x200B;

As always this is just my opinion and I am not a financial advisor. Just a donut. Just over 40 at 140 and 142 at 330.

Title: Due Diligence - My Resons for Going Long in Blackberry
I know that last week was a bit on the turbulent side for BB. I decided to double-check my original BB DD, as a way to remind myself of why I invested in the first place. From my point of view, nothing has changed in the fundamentals, and I am still very well satisfied with my investment.

Currently, I have 410 stocks, with an average buy-in of $17,62 per stock.

Before getting down to the good stuff, I just want to point out that **this is in no way financal advice**, neither do I take any responsibility for your financial choices based on my text. I'm just your average happy amateur.

**THE PHONE COMPANY THAT SWITCHED TO IoT AND CYBER SECURITY**

For starters, you can't really exclusively call Blackberry a phone company anymore. They've switched their main focus to Cyber Security and IoT. Today, BB provides solutions for Unified Endpoint Security, Penetration Testing, Ransomware Protection and Blackberry QNX (remember that last one, because it's important).

In December of 2020, a massive attack occured against SolarWinds, a major IT firm that provides software for entities ranging from Fortune 500 companies to the US government. The US agencies in question that got attacked were: parts of the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, the Department of Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and the Treasury.

However, **not a single of BlackBerry's customers were affected by the hack**.

**BLACKBERRY QNX**

Blackberry owns and develops the closed source QNX operating system, which is a real-time operating system (meaning that it can process data without buffer delays). If you have a smartphone or a car, chances are that in one way or another, it runs with QNX embedded.

Read more about QNX [here](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2019/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-150-million-vehicles).

**PARTNERSHIP WITH BAIDU, XPENG and GAC GROUP: EV-INDUSTRY IN CHINA**

Just like in other developed parts of the world, it's springtime for the electrical vehicle-market in China. You might have heard about some of their most successful brands: NIO, BAIDU, XPENG and GAC group.

NIO has a market cap of **$61.6 bn**, XPENG has a market cap of **$31.5 bn**, Baidu has a market cap of **$80,16**, and GAC group has a market cap of a whooping **$114,7 bn**.

Why is this good for Blackberry?

1. In August 2020, BB announced that they will be *"powering the Level 3 driving domain controller of Xpeng"* using... you guessed it! **QNX!**
2. A couple of weeks ago, BB announced that they would deepen their partnership with Chinese GAC Group, who amongst other things make electric cars. I read an article from a couple of days ago claiming that *"Future GAC electric cars will get BlackBerry driving assistance technology"* using... you guessed it! **QNX!**
3. Since April 2019, GAC group and NIO (the other EV maker) has had a joint venture in the form of the brand "Hycan", an electric car manufacturer. It's not farfetched to believe that there is a good chance of the Hycans to have QNX embedded as well.

Read more [here](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology-301211498.html).

**PARTNERSHIP WITH AMAZON**

As you all probably already know, Amazon is the world's largest e-commerce and cloud platform company. BlackBerry recently partnered withAmazon Web Services (AWS) to launch a new connected vehicle platform that merges BlackBerry's QNX operating system with AWS's IoT services.

AWS launched its IoT platform in2015. At the time, Amazon stated that it would make it easier for developers to create apps that link to myriad IoT gadgets, including smart speakers, home appliances, wearables, and connected cars. AWS is already the world's top cloud platform, so it makes perfect sense to integrate its IoT service into the most widely used embedded operating system for connected cars.

By linking QNX to the cloud, automakers can instantly monitor a vehicle's EV battery levels and vehicle subsystems, provide over-the-air software updates, and personalize vehicle cockpits, advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and machine learning models for autonomous driving through cloud-based apps.

This reinforces BlackBerry's market-dominating position in embedded operating systems for connected cars, which also circles back to BB's endevours on the Chinese EV-market.

**PROJECT KUIPER**

I want to warn you all that this next part is purely speculation on my part.

From Wikipedia:  **Kuiper Systems LLC** is a subsidiary of Amazon that was set up in 2019 to deploy a large broadband satellite internet constellation to provide broadband internet connectivity. The deployment is also referred to by its project name "**Project Kuiper**". Amazon announced that it would be investing $10 billion in this project to deploy the satellite internet constellation.

How could BB fit into this thing?

Well, here's my hypothesis:

Why would Amazon start a long-term partnership with BlackBerry? Well, because BlackBerry has competency that Amazon lacks in-house of course. If Amazon wants to send satellites to space, why wouldn't they use Blackberry, when QNX has already been used in rockets by NASA and SpaceX?

Although there isn't any concrete evidence for my claims about BB and Project Kuiper, I personally don't believe that my thougts are way "out there". I guess time will tell if I'm right, but it's what I'm betting on!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TL;DR:

* BB's QNX operating system could become huge during 2021 due to BB's involvement with Amazon and Chinese EV-manufacturers.
* BB could play an important part in Project Kuiper

Whats Happened the Past Few Days?: The Anatomy of a Short Ladder Attack

Published courtesy of Citizens for Securities Reform, at http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html

Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.

The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.

When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.


Typical tactics include the following:

Flooding the offer side of the board - Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.

The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.

By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of "strategic fails-to-deliver" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will "mask" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.

Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other "success" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.

Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.


Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called "crashing" the stock and a successful "crash" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash "stick" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:

Media Assault -

The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.

The shorts have "friendly" reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the Wall Street Journal, Barrons, the New York Times, Gannett Publications (USA Today and the Arizona Republic), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the "friendly" reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.

One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair - proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This "mistake" was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation "Due to a mathematical error" appeared three days later - after the damage was done to the stock price.

Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.

This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.


Analyst Reports -

Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned "friendly" media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.

Planting moles in target companies -

The shorts plant "moles" inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media.

Frivolous SEC investigations -

The shorts "leak" tips to the SEC about "corporate malfeasance" by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed "confidential inquiry" is leaked to the short media.

The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community.

Class Action lawsuits -

Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.

Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc. -

If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product.


Pulling margin from long customers -

The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover. (Click here for more on Pulling Margin).

Paid bashers -

The shorts will hire paid bashers who "invade" the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation. (Click here for Confessions Of A Paid Stock Basher).

This is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.

How Pervasive Is This?

At any given point in time more than 100 emerging companies are under attack as described above. This is not to be confused with the day-to-day shorting that occurs in virtually every stock, which is purportedly about thirty percent of the daily volume.

The success rate for short attacks is over ninety percent-a success being defined as putting the company into bankruptcy or driving the stock price to pennies. It is estimated that 1000 small companies have been put out of business by the shorts. Admittedly, not every small company deserves to succeed, but they do deserve a level playing field.

The secrecy that surrounds the shorts, the prime brokers, the DTC and the regulatory agencies makes it impossible to accurately estimate how much money has been stolen from the investing public by these predators, but the total is measured in billions of dollars. The problem is also international in scope

Title: Ultimate XL DD


Alright autists, put down your pitchforks and stop raging at Robinhood and read about the next moonshot for 5 min...

TLDR for you retards who dont have the patience and/or the ability to read is located at the bottom.

**Summary** 

XL fleet is a company primarily involved with the electrification of commercial fleet vehicles across the US.  This company aims to reduce carbon emissions by vehicles by fitting vehicles with electric components to transform gas powered vehicles into hybrids.

**The players**

Tod Hynes- The founder and president of XL Fleet who currently is a senior professor at MIT, where he lectures a graduate course, Energy Ventures. He also co-founded the MIT Clean Energy Prize.

Dimitri Kazarinoff- Current CEO of XL fleet. He is an accomplished transportation industry executive who has led impressive growth, expansion and innovation throughout his career. Prior to joining XL as CEO, Dimitri successfully scaled the hybrid power systems division of Eaton Corporation by 15x within two years.  He also has worked at General Motors.

Needless to say, the current leadership of XL fleet has decades of experience not only in Clean Energy, but also in leadership and expansion.

**Application**

The Implementation of electric components to vehicles is no doubt extremely beneficial to both the customer and the environment. Heres how:

- XLs hybrid electric  drive system improves vehicle MPG by up to 25% and reduces CO2 emissions by up to 20% for Class 2-6 fleets.

- Their Plug-In drive system improved vehicle MPG by up to 50% and reduces CO2 emissions by 33% in Ford F-150 and F-250 pickup trucks.

- XL grid is XLs charging and power stations, and simultaneously function as driving data site analysis and solar power sites. 

These figures are pretty impressive, and saving the consumer money via gasoline consumption and saving the environment via reduced CO2 emissions is a win-win.

** Other Info**

- On Jan 21, 2021 XL fleet was named one of the Top 100 Impact Companies by Real Leaders Magazine

- Partners with GM and Ford, along with other well-established and successful companies such as Coca-Cola. 

- The US government will replace its entire fleet of 645,000 cars and trucks with US-made electric vehicles, president Joe Biden said on Jan. 25, while signing a Buy America executive order that creates new guidelines for the governments $600 billion in annual spending on goods and services.  XL fleet can capitalize on this opportunity to further expand their operations and boost their publicity

- This stock is currently over 70% shorted with a low float (~8,000,000). Now this is not the next GME by any means, but I believe that the foundation that this company has and the fact that the Biden Administration is focusing so heavily on EV will drive this stock upward quickly. 

**TLDR**

XL fleet is poised to rocket to the stratosphere based on its foundation, application under the Biden administration, and its partnerships (All mentioned above).  Couple this with its low float and high short percentage (70%+) and weve got ourselves an early boarding pass to Alpha  Centauri. 

Alright retards, resume brandishing those pitchforks and rage on against Robinhood, Citadel, Melvin, and , but do so with XL fleet in mind.  

Giraffe out.

Positions- 200 shares and several 8/20 25c

Title: Why Things Are Still Looking Good: FUTURE CATALYSTS AND OUTLOOK
Let's be real, some of you are sounding like desperate fucks. You don't need to convince anybody to hold their shares; have confidence and hold strong, here is why:

Today we shook all of the paper hands. I repeat: TODAY WE SHOOK ALL OF THE PAPER HANDS. Every single mf holding the stock has **diamond**   hands and will not sell. **DFV is still in**, I'm still in, we are STILL IN. We have created a moat.

Potential upcoming catalysts:

* Potential announcements from gamestop regarding their outlook and business plans
* More celebrity shoutouts and support by the day.
* ITM calls from friday must be settled tomorrow at the latest
* Legal developments (ie SEC involvement, congressional hearings)
* More people realizing silver is a fucking scam.
* WSB subscribers up to 8 million (was 6-7 million last week) and continuing to rise this week.
* Official/reliable government short data released feb 9 or something

&amp;#x200B;

**Addressing doubts:**

* According to some sources, the short percentage has dropped:

We don't know the actual short percentage. All numbers we have are estimates, which can easily be manipulated by shorters with various tactics (using options, etc) or methodology changes (not accounting synthetic longs, etc). Even if we do accept the data from S3, the short squeeze thesis is not contested or done-- as long as people hold the shorts still lose money whether they have an absurdly pants-on-fire high amount, or a lower but still insanely high amount. The true "float" of shares gets lower and lower as more and more diamond hands enter at dips. It is even possible to short squeeze at 10% (and lower) if nobody sells and buying ramps up due to some catalysts. Keep in mind they could add more shorts today or at any time if they believe we are losing momentum.

&amp;#x200B;

* What if the whales rug pull us? (or some shady under-the-table deal, etc)

&amp;#x200B;

The whales want to make money too, and they make the most money off of volatility and GME staying high and popular. They have the retail data, they read wsb. They know you fucks ain't selling. If they wanted us to tank the price would already be 40. They would never let short sellers off the hoo knowing they could squeeze them dry.

&amp;#x200B;

* What if shorts never give up and continue to lower the price?

I don't know about you but I believe in the stubbornness of our community of apes (which lose nothing from holding) more than hedge funds which are losing money daily. They don't want to tie up capital on losing trades for such an extended period of time.

&amp;#x200B;

* "Veterans" and people with "concerns"

Likely holding puts or have no better idea wtf is happening than you do. What do they hope they accomplish with these "concerns"? Are they helping you by trying to spark a panic sell?

&amp;#x200B;

Welcome people's doubts with open arms and offer your rebuttals: our community has a diamond will.

These are just my dumb thoughts, godspeed apes.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: GME GO UP

Title: IS $AG THE NEW $GME OR IS THIS PLAIN MANIPULATION?
Many of us retards are holding $GME, I personally believe and I want to hold this stock as much as I possibly can. But the charts and the numbers are clear, today $GME was down -42% while $AG soared +22%.

The real question here.. is it time to get into the $AG train before it's too late? I am going to hold my humble 10 stocks of $GME as much as I can, but I'm really concerned.

Can someone bring a real explanation of what's going on? Why is $AG +22% today?

Before reading my take on the subject, [please go read u/johnnydaggers take before. It's the most interesting thing I've read this week-end](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)


 **STATUS QUO** 


In a game of musical chairs slowing down because of a drying liquidity, both parties may be stuck for a while in an inconfortable position. Shorts are experiencing a slow burn paying interests for their borrowed shares and Longs might feel discouraged with a sense of injustice turning odds against them (especially retail investors).
The problem is, paid interests are marginal (millions) when that could be much much worse with an ever increasing percentage of longs which has been quite halted since last Thursday. Shorts are then playing against the clock hoping for some backup by the SEC simply freezing the trade of $GME for ten days or more, killing momentum and scaring people away --&gt; papers hands flying in the eye of the storm. 

What can we do other than buying more shares and holding? Most of us are out of ammo and holding has its limitations too. We've gone a long way, me might have already landed in the moon unknowingly but I know we all aim for more.
But lets be realistic for a second, we've just invaded Dirty Money People playground and they know every corner of it. We may be in a strong position regarding $GME, but we don't drive the narrative for the remaining 99.99% of the stock market. Shorts still can make big bucks elsewhere, even though they have to liquidate their assets to fund our Nintendos, Teslas, dildo shaped rockets to effing Mars, etc. 

SHARES DON'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE. Yes we already know.
SHORTED SHARES DON'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE. Ok we know that too, they *only* have interests to pay.


 **NOT JET FUEL BUT OUT OF THIS WORLD NUCLEAR BLAST TYPE FUEL** 


What do we do to **FORCE** them to buy those shares NEXT WEEK?
What has always been our weapon of choice?
Last week we were too much focused on owning our shares and holding that we collectively agreed that options were not the best way to trigger the MOASS. The plan was followed religiously and that's still an advantage.


 **What my only wrinkle whispered to me while in bed this morning** 


As you retards already now, ITM options can be exercised for shares : 100xcontracts you own.
Meaning, past the expiration date, those shares HAVE TO be bought within the following week and given to you lucky retards.
Unfortunately, right now, one single of those safe contract cost so much that most of us can't afford it anymore.
*Wrote this half assed DD this morning and it seems like options buying has been made difficult in several brokerages, meaning they don't want us to go this way...*

NOW we need bigger fishes to light a fire so hot Shorts would not have time to lose their shirts but cook instantly! We need rich kids and mad billionaires!

IF we collectively hold and harden our diamonds hands even more in this week to come, and have rich troopers coming to buy every single deep ITM and ITM calls there is, next week is going to trigger the biggest chain reaction and propel us so fast that we could attain light speed in a snap and reach $69,420.69 


 **PAPA MUSK, if you are reading this poorly made DD, don't buy shares, buy far ITM options to force their hands and make us 0.001% as rich as you!! I'll definitely buy a Tesla if it goes higher than $6000** 


Thanks for your consideration. I don't know what I've just wrote down. I'm ape. I like bananas and I like $GME for sure.

Title: Why the $GME price is not the best indicator of what is really going on with the stock.
[THE VOLUME](https://www.tradingview.com/x/5ejo6FPT/)

I'm a retard, don't take financial advice from me.

See the chart linked above. This is why the current price of $GME is a misleading indicator of the actual situation at hand. The turquoise/salmon bars at the bottom indicate the volume traded. The chart starts on Jan 11th on the left and ends with today, Feb 1st on the right. Today was the lowest volume traded since this whole rocket ship really started blasting off.

Additionally, the thin green bars at the bottom are a Squeeze Momentum indicator (measures volatility). The squeeze officially started on Jan 13th and has been building momentum steadily over the past two weeks. It appears that the pressure is building.

Who knows where this goes from here.

Title: Reconciling S3 Short Interest Data w/ Actual Trading Volume
I've seen a lot of posts on here claiming the latest S3 short interest data couldn't be possible with current volume, but they had appeared to be accurate up until recently, so I did a little digging.

## First, the data:

on 1/29, [S3 reported](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755?s=20) that projected short interest was 113.31% of float with 57.83M shares shorted. Important to note is that this data represents their estimates for END OF DAY ON 1/28.

on 2/1, [Ihor Dusaniwsky](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356261806612885509?s=20) S3's managing director of predictive analytics reported that projected short interest was 53.15% of float with 27.12M shares shorted. This data represents their estimates for END OF DAY ON 1/29

This means that shorts had to purchase at least 30.71M shares on Friday total (including pre and post market trading).

On Friday, we saw a trading volume of 50.25M [source](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history?p=GME)

 ## What does this mean?
The data stands up to the test of basic math. There WAS enough trading volume on Friday for shorts to cover and GME ended the day up about $120 / share.

## Conclusions and Opinions (NOT DATA)

I suspect that most of the older shorts have in fact covered on Friday. Retail was still heavily limited in volume due to Robinhood and other broker trading restrictions, and I doubt retail had enough fuel on their own to explain the rise in price on Friday. It is fully possible that AT THE CURRENT MOMENT we won't have another short squeeze. I closed my GME positions this morning at $250 due to a relatively high cost basis and seeing that there is some truth to shorts covering. If short interest picks up again and the price dips low enough, I may re-enter. Y'all probably think I'm paper handed, but I did what I thought was best given my current situation. If I had actually gotten in back when it was sub $100, I might have been a lot more comfortable holding.

Some people will probably say that 50%+ short interest is pretty high, however I currently suspect most of those shorts entered their positions above the $300 mark, and thus can handle a lot of pain before they are squoze. Retail would need to drive the price up significantly on their own before we see more squeeze IMO.

This is speculation and not investment advice, do your own DD, blah blah.

Title: Why the price is dipping and why you shouldnt worry.
Today, we saw a MASSIVE dip for our beloved ticker, not unlike the dip we saw the days before. This is due to short ladder attacks done by hedge funds which is a form of market manipulation to lower the price artificially, scare us, and get us to sell our shares to them to cover.

We know this for two reasons.

1. Volume: The volume for the last couple trading days was quite low. What is volume? Its the act of trading (buying and selling) shares for that day. Today, the volume was just not high enough to justify such a dip. The same thing is happening after hours where volume is MUCH lower because the US market doesnt have access to the the stock. Low volume means low volatility. These dips were HIGH volatility, but with low volume, which means the high volatility cannot be explained by the low volume, but instead of a short ladder attack. 

2. Bid/Ask Gap: If you have access to Level 2 data on Robinhood Gols (which is free for the first month and 5 dollars every subsequent month), you will notice that expanding the stock chart will reveal the option to add extra data. Among this data is the Bid Ask chart. This chart simply shows you how many shares are ready to be sold at a certain price and how many shares are ready to be bought at a certain price. The Gap between them is the difference between the average bid (buyers) and ask (sellers). Todays gap was a whopping 5 dollars which is quite big. The average gap would just be a few cents on normal trading days.

3. Some of you may think, if they keep short laddering this, cant they just keep doing it to cover their positions? Well, they still have to buy shares from people and as we saw in the chart, even when the price fell, people massively bought as opposed to sold. Meaning every ladder attack leads to a huge upswing in price. The base for all this is around 100 dollars, its hard for it to go lower with all this attention, and a big whale will definitely eat that up. 

In the end, HOLD. The fundamentals and sympathy is on our side.

But what do I know, Im retarded. This is not financial advice, do your own Due Diligence.

**EDIT: Now that this is popular, please dont bet on silver, or NOK. Its a pump and dump.**

Title: Real Printers make Gains, my XRX Thoughts
 Ive been looking into non-GME stocks \*gasp\* \*heresy\* and I am gonna make a case for XRX, Xerox.

Truth is, I aint got the guts of steel to go into volatility like that. I wish all you brothers and sisters best of luck though. 

Right before the pandemic, Xerox traded at \~$38 dollars. The pandemic did affect their revenues, bopping it down to 7 billion annually, from the previous years 9 and some billion. 

This, along with pandemic stock battering, seems to have messed up Xeroxs valuation. Take a look at some of these numbers, which I pulled from tradingview. 

Market Cap: 4.48B

Total Assets: 14.741B

Total Debt: 4.86B

Free Cash Flow: 592M 

Gross Profit: 2.562B

This is all numbers from a pandemic battered year. I personally expect these numbers to go higher, given the end of the pandemic is now just perhaps half a year out. The stock trades right now, at $22.59. 

Let me do complete monkey math for a second: 14.741-4.86 = 9.881 =/= 4.48, not accounting the fact that they have a massive cash flow. To some extent the cash flows contribution can discounted, granted that they are a dividend stock with a yield somewhere near 4%. 

Xerox today also announced some business management shuffling, which is projected to boost growth and more clearly organize the businesss operations. I think their stock should thus have some incredible upside, both to us WSBers, and to those looking to invest in a sensible dividend stock. 

If you read this far, please share your thoughts too, this is basic numbers Im sure you guys know more complex terms. 

This isnt professional advice. 

Positions: I bought \~$600 of XRX calls for April, target $25. This is all I can afford till my next paycheck, when Ill go in bigger. 

P.S. dont expect anything related to a short squeeze, short% of float is small compared to what we are seeing.

Title: $SPCE potentially an interesting sideshow 
First and foremost: I am long, not financial advice, so on, so forth. Also not saying sell GME so get that only GME matters bullshit out of here!

To the point: SPCE pleas fly again isnt flying right now in the real world, but SpaceX is and theyre bringing civilians. This is bringing a lot of attention to SPCE for a number of reasons and I think its an excellent catalyst opportunity for the following reasons:

1. This legitimizes commercial space travel to a great extent and it will bring this new category to the forefront of conversations for the coming weeks/months. To my understanding, virgin is not doing so badly in this department themselves, so it shouldnt be challenging for them to get early adoption.

2. Short interest is high as shit. Contrary to what many of you have been taught, it does NOT take 100%+ short float to cause an epic squeeze. These happen all the time when black swans fuck up bear trades. GME was just the first time a community like our successfully triggered one. With that said, SPCE sits at 50%+ short interest, and was the third most shorted stock on the market following GME and AMC. The big difference is, unlike those two names that were recovery plays, this is an emerging business and is being shorted purely on valuation despite valuation being near impossible.

3. Valuing a stock like this is esoteric and I defined. This is a pre revenue company, but its one of the only players in a market that will be $30 billion+ by 2030 according to UBS. Lets assume 33% market share and a 2.5x price to sales multiple (good airline average js around 1.6), then youd get a $25 billion fair value in 2030. Given this thing will likely be growing much faster than any airline, and the fact that its balance sheet is fucking stacked $720+ mil cash vs around $40 mil in debt, this isnt outrageously priced. A lot less risky than hoping GME somehow justifies a $30 Billion market cap (again, not bashing it, just rationalizing that this isnt a crazy idea).

4. Low share count = high volatility. Not than many shares on the market, around 150 mil total and in the ballpark of 70 mil in the float. This baby could move, and, unlike a mature GME or AMC, you shouldnt count on insider bailing considering this is super early in the growth curve. This means less surprises and less risky for big at the market capital raises. (Again, not bearish on either name, long live apes!)

5. People are fucking stupid. People buy the wrong ticker all the time. ZM vs ZOOM. Hell, Im stupid, I bought the wrong ticker for Fisker, but so are other apes and I still made money! My dad even told me I need to add SpaceX, symbols SPCE months and months ago, and had no idea it was Virgin Galactic. I wouldnt be shocked if half the people in the AH though this was SpaceX, hell, I wouldnt be surprised if half of you reading this thought it was SpaceX.

In short, this seems like an excellent trade idea thats primed for a short squeeze pop. Thats why Im buying at least.

Do your own research though, these are just my opinions, not financial advice, know your risks.

Title: Whats Happened the Past Few Days?: The Anatomy of a Short Ladder Attack
Published courtesy of Citizens for Securities Reform, at http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html

Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.

The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.

When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.


Typical tactics include the following:

Flooding the offer side of the board - Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.

The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.

By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of "strategic fails-to-deliver" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will "mask" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.

Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other "success" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.

Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.


Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called "crashing" the stock and a successful "crash" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash "stick" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:

Media Assault -

The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.

The shorts have "friendly" reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the Wall Street Journal, Barrons, the New York Times, Gannett Publications (USA Today and the Arizona Republic), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the "friendly" reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.

One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair - proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This "mistake" was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation "Due to a mathematical error" appeared three days later - after the damage was done to the stock price.

Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.

This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.


Analyst Reports -

Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned "friendly" media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.

Planting moles in target companies -

The shorts plant "moles" inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media.

Frivolous SEC investigations -

The shorts "leak" tips to the SEC about "corporate malfeasance" by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed "confidential inquiry" is leaked to the short media.

The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community.

Class Action lawsuits -

Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.

Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc. -

If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product.


Pulling margin from long customers -

The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover. (Click here for more on Pulling Margin).

Paid bashers -

The shorts will hire paid bashers who "invade" the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation. (Click here for Confessions Of A Paid Stock Basher).

This is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.

How Pervasive Is This?

At any given point in time more than 100 emerging companies are under attack as described above. This is not to be confused with the day-to-day shorting that occurs in virtually every stock, which is purportedly about thirty percent of the daily volume.

The success rate for short attacks is over ninety percent-a success being defined as putting the company into bankruptcy or driving the stock price to pennies. It is estimated that 1000 small companies have been put out of business by the shorts. Admittedly, not every small company deserves to succeed, but they do deserve a level playing field.

The secrecy that surrounds the shorts, the prime brokers, the DTC and the regulatory agencies makes it impossible to accurately estimate how much money has been stolen from the investing public by these predators, but the total is measured in billions of dollars. The problem is also international in scope

Title: Long sportsbetting stocks into Superbowl DKNG PENN
Why you should go mega long PENN and DKNG:

So PENN owns barstool and sportsbooks, DKNG has daily fantasy and sports betting, and I think there are multiple reasons why buying calls would be good. The runup to the Superbowl, the increase in popularity of gambling/sports betting, and states will continue to legalize sportsbetting.

First off, the Superbowl is coming up on February 7th. You all know you are going to bet massive amounts this year with all your tendies. Mahomes and Brady is a huge draw. There is going to be record sports betting on the Superbowl which is going to signal massive growth for these companies.

Second, we've all become rich this year and have money to blow. We are the key demographic for sports gambling. Without a doubt we are going to see record inflows into sportsbetting in the future. It has the potential to be a trillion dollar industry.

Third, US states are dying for money right now. Cuomo has said he wants to legalize sports betting in NY to help raise revenue. That is a huge market and would be huge for PENN and DKNG. ([https://www.barrons.com/articles/draftkings-penn-national-jump-on-news-that-cuomo-supports-making-online-sports-betting-legal-51609984632?mod=article\_inline](https://www.barrons.com/articles/draftkings-penn-national-jump-on-news-that-cuomo-supports-making-online-sports-betting-legal-51609984632?mod=article_inline)). Here's a Cuomo quote from this article:

"New York has the potential to be the largest sports wagering market in the United States, and by legalizing online sports betting we aim to keep millions of dollars in revenue here at home, which will only strengthen our ability to rebuild from the \[Covid-19\] crisis.

I mean it is a no brainer for these states to legalize sports betting for raising revenue. No reason why other states wouldn't feel the same way as NY.

Everyone has become gambling degens now with the GME short squeeze. We need our fix. Sportsbetting is going to have massive growth. The tailwind of the Superbowl and states legalizing are going to cause these stocks to moon.

PENN Feb 12 160c

DKNG Feb 26 80c

Edit: I really aped into these. ARKW added DKNG. Cathie Wood ty for the tendies!

Edit: Ty for the gold!

Title: BCRX: Get in before takeoff
BCRX: The most undervalued stock in the market

First up, I'm acting as a surrogate for u/BIO9999 as he can't post here yet but is absolutely brilliant and deserves to be heard.  He'll be around in the thread to answer questions

We are going to look at**Biocrysts**recently approved drug**Berotralstat**, AKA**Orladeyo**. It is a**once-a-day pill**given to patients with a terrible lifelong disease called**Hereditary Angioedema**, that results in them having to**frequently visit the Emergency Room**for life-threatening angioedema attacks (check out Youtube for videos of HAE patients suffering from these attacks and using Berotralstat). It is estimated that this disease affects**1 in 50,000**people in the world, or roughly**140,000 people**, so although considered a rare disease, it is still affecting a**lot**of folks.

The available treatments for this disease are**all IV drugs**that are painful and produce local reactions. Berotralstat is the**first oral drug**. It achieved excellent results in phase 3 trials, and the US FDA gave it**fast track**status in 2018 and Japan gave it**Sakigake**status (type of fast track). Then**on December 3rd, the US granted approval for the drug**. They did it very importantly with**zero label**statements--meaning that they had no concerns about side effects or dangers.**On January 22nd, Japan granted approval**. The**EU**also met last week to discuss approval and will announce its result**this quarter**.

So let's look at what the above means for this stock. First the drug is in**HIGH**demand. In the US there are at least**10,000**people with HAE. Despite the disease being frequently debilitating, patients are so uncomfortable about getting regular injections that**only 7,500**are currently being treated with IV injections. The other 2,500 are going**untreated**despite the high risks. Now let's look at the 7,500 patients on a prophylactic treatment. Based on numerous surveys by doctors, the company, and researchers, most of these people would prefer an oral treatment. Take a look at this peer-reviewed survey article finding that[98% of IV prophylactic patients (the 7,500) would prefer an oral treatment and 96% of the non-prophylactic patients (the 2,500) would want an oral treatment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33489436/).

No wonder then that one of the preeminent biotech analysts, Evercore's Liisa Bayko, wrote to her clients on December 4th that Berotralstat was likely to quickly**take at least 30% of the HAE market**based on Evercore surveys of patient and doctor demand.

Remember that this is**just the US**.... Japan did not even have any prophylactic treatment until Berotralstat was approved there a few days ago. They have**500 people registered with HAE**and estimated**2,000 ready to be registered**. [TheUKis so desperate to add the drug for its patients, it did not even wait until the formal approval process to go through and gaveearly access to the drug on November 9th](https://angioedemanews.com/2020/11/09/berotralstat-available-to-eligible-patients-uk-through-early-access-program/#:~:text=Berotralstat%20%E2%80%94%20an%20oral%20therapy%20by,before%20its%20potential%20regulatory%20approval).

The EU is not far behind, with its estimated**20,000 patients**, with approval coming in the next few weeks. Then there is the rest of the world. The HAE patient population in**Latin America**is estimated by**HAE International**, the most important advocacy organization for HAE patients worldwide and one of**Berotralstats biggest supporters**, to be**over 15,000 patients**, the vast majority of whom are poorly diagnosed and not prophylactically treated. Argentina and Brazil have the highest actual diagnostic rates. HAEI through its Latin American sister organizations is strongly advocating for Berotralstat in Latin America.

Next, it should be noted that Biocryst built a**world-class sales team**for this drug in the US and EU and signed a**partnership with Torii in Japan**to take charge of the large sales and marketing promotion there. It has hired dozens of professionals, most from its HAE competitors. Its**vice-president**and US general manager**Allen Hodge**was even responsible for the**successful efforts of the HAE drug launches**of Cinryze and Firazyr, two pioneering injectable treatments for HAE. You could not get a more promising leader for this task.

It should also be pointed out that this drug, an oral kallikrein inhibitor, is potentially of**huge value for a host of diseases, including COVID-19**(that is now recognized to severely affect the kallikrein-kinin system, and kallikrein inhibitors have begun to be tested against COVID19--see this (IV)**kallikrein inhibitor trial that was just announced in Brazil**for instance:[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472675/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472675/)),**diabetic macular edema**(which Biocryst just obtained a patent on a technique to administer kallikrein inhibitors for), many autoimmune diseases, and even some types of cancer.

Last but not least, how should this stock be valued based on this one drug? First, this drug is**one of the 10 most expensive drugs**(based on its annual cost of prescription) in the world, but still**less than the price of its IV competitors**, at $488,000 per patient per year. This drug is being approved by insurance companies**left, right, and center**as their preferred treatment, all you have to do is follow[R8](https://stocktwits.com/R8Plus)or[nickpd](https://stocktwits.com/nickpd) on Stocktwits to see how many insurance companies have been making it easy for patients to sign up for the drug.[Optime careeven lets patients getdirect-to-patientprescriptions now](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/biocryst-scores-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-first-oral-option-to-prevent-hae-attacks).

So what does all this mean for sales? And why is the stock not valued based on just this drug alone (I will get to the others in**future posts**)? I**estimate conservatively**that by December 2021, there will be**over 6,000 patients on Berotralstat in the US, EU and Japan**, and I can share in a future post the graphs and calculations I made to get to those numbers. 6,000 patients annualized is up to**$2.9 billion in annual sales**.**Most**of this is going to be**profit**. At a**conservative price to sales ratio of 7**, that should produce a price of**$121, not $8.52**!  If you want to play around with the math yourself, look [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tLvclUzTqCitwKfawL7kGCLquJxA2T7IJKLg52VWotE/edit?usp=sharing).

And that is**just the beginning**. Because Factor D and Galidesivir are going to be much bigger than Berotralstat for reasons I will explain in future posts. Remember that**its Factor D drug, which is showing superiority to all other anti-complement drugs in Phase I trials and was fast-tracked and given orphan status by the FDA and now is in Phase 2 though not officially announced by the company eyt,**and can be used in at least 20 diseases including common ones like Rheumatoid Arthritis, is currently**not even factoring into BCRX's valuation**. Consider that**Alexion with its significantly inferior anti-complement drug was just sold to Astra-Zeneca for $39 billion**because of the**recognized potential of anti-complement drugs**for a host of diseases. BCRX even has has**other drugs like Peramivir, already approved for Influenza and able to be used for the next bird flu pandemic, and its FOP drug--a story for another day**.

So why is this company, with**zero risk of dilution**due to an**amazing royalty deal**it signed in December and**three super-drugs**each worth tens of billions of dollars, and a host of other exciting developments to look forward to,**worth only $1.5 billion right now?**It can only be because the company's stock has been**relentlessly shorted in 2020 and 2021**to allow for significant accumulation by institutions. That is why the stock**only went up 168%**, yes "***ONLY***"**168%**...

The time for BCRX investors is**now**. My next post will be about Factor D, brace for that one. Factor D is 10 times bigger than Berotralstat! Good luck to all!

Title: Why $GME short interest appears to have fallen when in reality it has not.
Ok, girls, I have an explanation why short interest is reported to have fallen when in fact it has not. Its not data faking, its hedge funds hedging their shorts with calls and puts. Let me explain.

Gary Black is a guy to follow. Not always follow his advice or take everything for granted, but he gives a good insight into how hedge funds think: https://mobile.twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1356253412103512065

Gary has the opinion, that short sellers have hedged their short position by buying ATM calls and selling ATM puts that match the share count of its short. Ok, so lets run through this scenario:

1. Before expiration, the fund doesnt do anything, he has to pay the daily fee of the short interest on his shares and he loses value on his call as well as gains value on his put (because he sold it). This can draw out the short squeeze by month!
2. At expiration, if the share price is above purchase price, he can exercise the call, return the shares and the put expires worthless so he keeps the premium.
3. If the share price goes down, the call expires worthless but he buys shares with the put and returns these shares to close his short position.

In scenario 1, the short interest stays the same as nothing happens. But I can totally see the statistics to **reduce the reported short position because it is fully hedged!** In scenario 2, the call seller has to find the shares on the market. In scenario 3 its the same, but this time the put buyer has to find the shares.

**IN ALL 3 SCENARIOS, THE SHORT INTEREST STAYS THE SAME BUT THE REPORTED SHORT INTEREST GOES DOWN BECAUSE ITS SHOVED UNDER THE RUG OF THE OPTIONS TRADERS.**

Which means, the statistics might be correct, but the true short interest is still the same as before! **THE SHORTS ARE NOT OFF THE HOOK!**

No investment advice you monkeys! We have the shorts by the balls until they turn blue and fall off!

Position: $GME at $19 and HOLDING!

Title: Nokia $NOK is bad idea? Not really! It's brilliant!
There is a lot of people that push you to buy hype GME because they want to get rich like us fellow. But  in this Holly War they started to make dirty steps like saying that other tickers like NOK or BB or SLV is bad idea. This is because they don't want to lose they money. And they don't care about money of other people that already have a deep looses.

Why I think that Nokia is a great idea for other few millions that didn't enter in GME in appropriate time. And this is a reasons:

1. During this year Nokia has taken only hold and buy ratings from all analysts including best performing. And it's not connected with WSB activity at all.
2. 3.3% of best performing individual investors started to buy Nokia. And this number is continually increasing.
3. Blogger sentiments is mostly bullish.
4. Company is based in Europe and it pretend to get profit from the expansion of the [5G market](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) in 2021. Most of all it could avoid cyber security issues in US and Europe markets in comparison with Chinese companies.
5. Nokia news sentiments is 86% bullish. There are plant of articles about 5G equipment
6. EPS was increased twice during this year (see below)
7. Dividend yield twice bigger than sector average: 1.86%, Sector Average: 0.93%
8. Nokia literally goes to the moon and pretend to be the first mobile network on the surface. Think about Space X and Virgin galactic success in this year and Catherine Wood space fund.

Title: Spread out your investments when investing in volatile stocks
For people that are considering investing in volatile stocks like $gme for the first time - it can be good to spread out your investment. Stocks like this can fluctuate significantly, it's possible that you'll add your money at the peak price and within a day it will lose half its value which might discourage you and cause you to cut your losses and walk away. Instead, consider spreading out your contributions so that if there's a dip in the stock price you can buy the dip and feel more confident about your investment.

I'm not in a financial advisor, this is just common sense.

Edit: Yes I know this goes against everything this sub believes in, YOLO

Title: SHORT SQUEEZE $GME $INO Cancer CURE
PAYBACK TIME- Short Squeeze Imminent

Its time to make Citron short seller feel the burn. They have shorted the sh*t out of this stock. This company has a huge pipeline of cures. HPV, Cancer, and now COVID-19. 

They have millions in funding from Department of Defense for their Cellectra Vaccine delivery device. Have you read about any stories of the army getting COVID-19? My point exactly. Connect the dots.

Theyre also running trials in China and just finished phase 2. They will start phase 3 during THIS 1ST QUARTER. China also signed a $100 million deal with INO for the use of their COVID-19 vaccine. China has a HUGE market. 

This stock has been wrongfully manipulated to its core due to Hedge Fund/Big Pharma/FDA/ corruption.  This company can literally end the pandemic. Their phase 1 results show 100% efficacy rate for their COVID vaccine. Its time for the squeeze. BUY AND HOLD.  

This is not financial advice. Im just a retard who likes Stonks.

Title: Rocket Mortgage $RKT to the moon 
**Mortgage market is hot (and your wife)**

If you are have been locked in a basement for a while you may have missed that real-estate market has been hot. Low rates has made bored desperate housewifes think of buying a new house with a pool or second home where to go on a romantic weekend with their boyfriend. Try and buy a condo in a popular vacation spot like Miami. Condos are gone within a week of listing, sometimes within a day.

Mortgage rate is 3%, which makes owning a real-estate a great hedge against inflation. If inflation kicks in then the $300k condo today will be $400k in few years. And your house payment will be much lower in todays money versus in 5 years.

**Mortgage numbers in 2020 gave been best ever**

December mortgage numbers 26% higher than year ago (Refi up 102% from last year)

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/mortgage-demand-from-homebuyers-spikes-28percent.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/mortgage-demand-from-homebuyers-spikes-28percent.html)

January mortgage numbers 16% higher than year ago

For the year, Loan Origination on volume grew 71% annually, but the data is even better, because if you consider the refis which do not add to the volume, **there was a 158% growth in refinancing YOY.**

[https://www.housingwire.com/articles/loan-officers-made-insane-money-in-q4-2020/](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/loan-officers-made-insane-money-in-q4-2020/)

If rates start to increase we may see even more refi efforts in 2021 to capture the low interest rates.

**Alright, so why Rocket Mortgage?**

Well it is often in the **top 3 best rated mortgage companies**. In addition, the companys its primary focus is mortgages unlike Chase of BoA. So if mortgage numbers are good, then their numbers will be really good because their revenues is heavily depended on mortgages.

Brand recognition - Its probably one of the most recognizable names for mortgages. Their website gets over 110 million visits per year. More than any other mortgage site.

They are innovative, they have developed a directory for all of the local mortgage brokers. Now this is interesting. They are listing the brokers and do not charge any fees for the leads to the brokers whether they work with Rocket Mortgage or not for the load. Thats lost revenue right? Well, I think that they are building a good relationship with the local brokers, so that the brokers can get the origination fee and then send them business back to get the loan via Rocket Mortgage.

**Share ownership**

They IPOd around $21.50, then went as high as $30m, and then dropped to $20 levels. **Short interest in Rocket Mortgage is 30%. But the leadership team owns 95% of the entire Rocket Companies** parent company. So this shows huge insider holding of this company, which clearly indicates their strong belief in this company. Check out their CEOs message to the shorts [https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/29/rocket-companies-ceo-on-the-stocks-friday-surge.html](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/29/rocket-companies-ceo-on-the-stocks-friday-surge.html)

**Buzz**

There will be a buzz for rocket mortgage. They will have two superbowl ads this year to stay current and in peoples minds. This should play well with the time leading up to their earnings call which is coming up later in February. This can be a catalyst for the stock (it jumped last week to 23.50 with the whole shorts frenzy)

I have a good conviction on this company, but I am open to hear opposite views from you degenerates.

Positions 400 shares at $21.50. Thinking about some options too but don't have the balls to do a 30c 2/19 yet.

tl dr - I bought rocket  mortgage because I think it goes to the moon  

Also own GME, BBBY, NOK

Title: Long dated GME puts
I am completely retarded so please hear me out. From one disabled person to another please. Dont get me wrong. I am heavily invested in GME because I really like the stock. But...i do not think I will like the stock in 6+ months. I dont think GME will be worth 20bn in 6 months. After the squeeze...which might not happen...the share price could easily return to a significantly lower valuation. 

Why wouldnt the sqeeze happen? Well, only 20% of the outstanding public shares are owned by us little retard hands. That means the major price fluctuations are largely caused by massive hedge funds far larger than Melvin. We dont even know for sure that Melvin still holds the shorts. Another Mega Hedge could have bought them out and repositioned in a much better time frame. This fund could also be one of the major gamestop shareholders. What this means is that if the major shareholders decide to dump the stock will be left around 40-80 dollars a share at the current valuation.

Sticking it to the billionaires is the most room temperature IQ "movement" i have ever seen in my multiple years here and I congratulate each and every one of you retards for thinking thats whats happening. Most of the profits from this movement are going to go the hedge funds and insitutions that make Marvin captial look like your autistic son in the sand pit compared to your wifes boyfriend. 

The real kickers is that if they really do get left with 20-70 billion in debt they will most likely get bailed out by Mr. Rothschild and the fed and the American citizens will be left to pay back the debt with their tax dollars once again lining the pockets of billionaires.

TLDR: If you single brain cell "investors" are right and Melvin is stuck with a 70bn dollar bill the american peoples tax dollars will pay it and most of the profits will go to even larger cap hedge funds. Really sticking it to the billionaires retards. HOLD SHARES IN CASE I HAVE .5 brain cells and go long dated PUT options for when gamestop realizes its true market value.

Edit: Since I am in fact more than retarded, probably borderline Melvin, I need to mention that I would only play on these options during the supposed run up during the squeeze and hopefully sell during similar if not higher IV on the ride back down. Not holding till expiry per say.

There are an insane amount of Puts expiring over the next few weeks.

Look at the massive amount of Puts expiring 2/19 at strikes of $1 (52k), $20 (20k), $10 (18k), $50 (16k), $35 (15k), $30 (13k), $2 (13k), $5 (12k), and so on.

Am I special or is this a huge indicator?

tl;dr

AMC is the global leader in a $17 billion dollar industry thats been beaten senseless to the ground with so much room to run. After pioneering deals with streaming services, buying out their competition, and upgrading their facilities worldwide, 80% short interest is highly inappropriate for its TRUE fundamental value  $69.69 a share.

I fuckin miss movies. And when I say movies, I mean the whole damn experience. I wanna buy my $15 popcorn, pour an ungodly amount of butter and jalapenos on that shit and munch in a recliner seat watching in laser 4k quality. I like this company. I like this stock.

For the past few days, I've been scouring Google for news articles and company data. I've also been trying to find some detailed DD in here but theyve all been pretty limp-dick when it came to AMC. And most of the news articles I've read were surface-level AT BEST with a grim outlook based on first-glance analysis. Guess these analysts are just too damn lazy to dig deep.

Because when we dive into these issues, we can easily see that the theater giant may not be in as bad a situation as the media/analysts are claiming.

In fact, I believe that **AMC is absolutely misunderstood, overlooked, and** **undervalued.**

Here is why I am more confident than ever that $AMC will not only reach $30 but is in the perfect setup to see ATHs and WELL ABOVE.

# I. Ugly Start, Beautiful Setup

Chances are if you are currently holding a significant position in $AMC, then most likely you've already read up on the company and its current standing in the cinema industry. You've probably read about how the corporation has nearly [$5 billion dollars worth of debt](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/amc-could-benefit-from-bankruptcy-analysts-say.html) with many of its locations still closed as the pandemic remains a global issue. You may have realized that new movies haven't been coming out. But more than that, you're seeing that movies are just being[ released on streaming platforms](https://hbr.org/2021/01/will-movie-theaters-survive-when-audiences-can-stream-new-releases) anyway. You might be concerned for AMC, or even the industry as a whole.

All of these concerns are very valid and based on real uncertainty, but let's break down each of these points and see if theyre as bad as analysts claim.

# II. A Discussion on Debt

Media outlets keep honing in on this debt like its an ugly scar of the corporation. But what we need to focus on is why that debt came to be, how the money was spent, and how this debt was a strategic play in order to cement AMC into the new era of cinema-streaming.

We can categorize the money used into four parts:

* **New equipment and amenities**
* **Lease payments**
* **Maintenance costs (utilities, wages, etc.)**
* **Expansion (buying out the competition)**

Pay close attention to the last category because this one is important. Over the past five years, AMC has been [acquiring smaller theater companies](https://tracxn.com/d/acquisitions/acquisitionsbyAMC-Theatres) like [Odeon](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/amc-theatres-closes-odeon-uci-acquisition-become-largest-exhibitor-europe-world-951348). After buying out these companies, AMC then had to suit its "new locations" with the standard luxury amenities AMC is known for. This makes for a significant bulk of their debt totaling over $3 billion in just acquisitions. This was the investment that helped **solidify AMCs spot as the world's largest cinema chain**.

On the topic of maintenance costs, AMC managed to raise enough money to [get through 2021](https://variety.com/2021/film/features/amc-ceo-adam-aron-coronavirus-bankruptcy-1234891440/). With ongoing news of vaccines, we can hope their efficacy leads to a speedy reopening near mid-late 2021. But when the economy *does* reopenand AMC is back at full operationwhat will it look like?

# III. The Future of AMC

There's an elephant here.. right in this very room. Yes, streaming and cinema have had some serious beef in the past. In fact, some cinema chains are having tensions with streaming to this day. But what has AMC done in regards to streaming? They were the first to[ settle deals](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/universal-amc-theatres-historic-deal-windows-1234718737/) in order to partner up and take part in streaming revenue.

*Yup, you read that right. AMC is both having their cake and eating it too.*

Why would motion picture companies do this? Why not just end the cinema industry? To put simply, analysts are deeply underestimating the value of the "cinema experience". Just as I mentioned in the intro, I miss the cinemas. But I am definitely not alone. But let's not talk about me and the hypothetical "people'', instead let's talk about research studies.

In a 3-year study done in Korea, researchers found that shortening the window of cinema exclusivity and releasing movies on streaming early[ did **not** have a significant effect on ticket sales](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3749476). And though this is a limited study done outside of the US, remember that AMC is a global corporation and these results have a hopeful outlook for the future relationship of cinema-streaming for AMC worldwide.

*"But wait, you still haven't mentioned what streaming gets out of this?"*

It's not what streaming "gets out of this" but rather what these motion picture companies maintain in keeping a healthy relationship with cinemas. During the peak heat of the movie theater-streaming feud, AMC[ halted the showing of Trolls](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/amc-theatres-trolls-world-tour-dispute-1234592445/) and vowed to never show a Universal Pictures film in its theaters again if they were to continue releasing their films on streaming platforms without a proper cinema-exclusivity window. But today, we can see that the tensions have fallen and both motion picture companies and AMC have found a way to mutually benefit each other.

Now besides streaming, AMC has been investing in luxury amenities as seen by their chairs, 4K laser projectors,[ MERV air filtration](https://www.amctheatres.com/amc-safe-and-clean), and ultra-surround sound speakers. With so many locations and so many amenities, they are offering [full theater rentals](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/amc-launches-private-theater-rental-program-111020.html) with high demand during the pandemic. AMC has further cultivated their century-old movie experience into modern times. And this pandemic didnt just change their amenities.

They had to learn how to[ cut costs and have more efficient operations](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/amc-could-benefit-from-bankruptcy-analysts-say.html) in order to survive. This only spells good news for when they emerge with better operations, more money to spend, and higher valuations. So that begs the question, how high can the company's share price go realistically?

# IV. Valuation

First, let's look at the Movie Theater industry as a whole in comparison to a few other popular entertainment industries:

[Movie Theater US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/movie-theaters-united-states/) **$17.1 billion**

[Casinos US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/non-hotel-casinos-united-states/) $15.7 billion

[Amusement Parks US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/amusement-parks-united-states/) $14 billion

[Music Label Music Production US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/major-label-music-production-united-states/) $9.4 billion

[Music Publishing US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/music-publishing-united-states/) $7 billion

In the world of entertainment, cinema is a very lucrative business.

And, again, who is the largest movie theater chain in the world? Yup,[ AMC](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2020/12/11/amc-worlds-largest-movie-theater-chain-raises-100-million-lifeline-but-it-needs-750-million-to-survive-next-year/?sh=338d2b35257b).

Clueless CNBC dude mentioned that we retail traders[ don't trade with a fundamental reason](https://youtu.be/_KpecK1mvNo?t=1577) but is there a fundamental reason in shorting a $17 billion dollar industry GLOBAL leader down to its grave? Does AMC deserve to die? I surely don't think so.

Now I won't touch upon squeezes in this since I'm sure many of you folk have already read/heard enough about them, but I will leave this quick intuitive[ article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/investing/2021/01/27/short-squeezes-what-to-know/43360347/) about it. And yes, these shorts can and will be squoze once we have faith in our upper valuations and investors(we) begin buying again.

**And buy again we will**. As many users flee limp-dick Robinhood and join one of the real brokerages, their positions/funds will be settled and ready to trade come next week. Where do you think these angry RH refugees will be putting their investments? That's right, exactly into the positions that RH stopped them from buying last week: which includes $AMC.

If you were part of the RH user base and your plays were affected by the blatant market manipulation, it's not only "not too late", but I believe it is an opportune time to **BUY**.

How high can it go then? When will I know it's too late to take a position?

So when we talk about valuation, many people fear the uncertainty of a stock rising far past its current value. Well, I think Chamath Palihapitiya[ said it best](https://youtu.be/_KpecK1mvNo?t=1522):

***"Everybody that bought that stock is also underwriting how they want to own it."***

In our current price-action environment, it's not too ridiculous to see how we are forming the foundations for AMC to continue rising beyond ATHs. We are already hitting nearly $16 on the day and rallying +53% while enduring heavy trade restrictions. Who's to say that this passion cannot continue? Now Im no expert and cant tell you how high this can go, but I am personally eyeing $69.69 as a target.

With so many current factors at play including hype, short covers, and ITM options having to be exercised, this is actually the BEST entrance to manifest its ATH valuation and chart some never before seen territory in its price action. **It's like the manifest destiny of stock valuation**. In fact, we may never see this opportunity for AMC again if we don't act now and solidify its value upward.

At the end of the day, prices are what the buyers/sellers settle upon so **WE** can pioneer that value if we damn well please. **This is what a free market is all about.**

*Will there be people that disagree with this?*

*Sure.*

Will people continue to short AMC as it goes up?

*Absolutely.*

Do I think that AMC being shorted 80% and rising is fair?

*Really? See section III.*

But institutions are selling off! Like [Silver Lake liquidating their 44m shares](https://www.barrons.com/articles/amc-entertainment-investor-silver-lake-sells-stake-51611962182).

*Yes, then the next day $AMC dipped to $7.50 and has since recovered  with AMC $600m less in debt.*

We all know who is shorting AMC, and I am sick of these hedge funds who think they, alone, can decide whether or not a company is worth a damn.

# V. Conclusion - Resurgence

We are at the cusp of AMCs resurgence. Because most of us have been kept from participating in social activities, we can better understand that the public is yearning for a sense of normalcy. Sure we've gone pretty far with just watching movies on our TVs or computers through the pandemic, but that doesn't scratch the itch for many folk.

What you're investing into when you invest in AMC is the entire experience in tandem with its new streaming deals. And having been beaten so lowwhile still holding such great fundamental prospects its share price is ready to blow up.

In the future when The Deep Squeeze is turned into a movie, well be a part of history.

And youre going to want to see it on the big screen.

Title: 15 U.S.C.A.  78i - the Illegality of Short Ladder Attacks (Legal insight)
Dear SEC and President Biden,

I am calling on you today, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A.  78i, titled Manipulation of Security Prices, to prohibit manipulative and deceptive tactics that artificially depresses the price of GME and AMC securities in contravention of the laws of the United States. 

Section 78i(a) clearly states that "It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of any facility of any national securities exchange, or for any member  of a national securities exchange -- **(2)**  To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, *a series of transactions* in any security registered on a national securities  exchange, any security not so registered, or *in connection with any security-based swap or security-based swap agreement* with respect to such security creating actual or apparent active trading in such  security, or **raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others."**

Currently, GME and AMC stock prices are actively being manipulated using a mechanism called "short ladder attacks" to depress the price of these stocks in contravention of 15 U.S.C.A.  78i. "Short ladder attacks" occur when large institutions in possession of the aforementioned stocks sell them for just less than market value in rapid succession between one another in order to drive the price down. The fact that short ladder attacks exist is apparent from on-going market activity that can be seen here

check this out

Such blatant attacks readily establishes prima facie case of market manipulation and must be investigated by the SEC immediately. Further silence from the SEC on this matter, which can be investigated quite quickly, not only encourages further market manipulation but also further diminishes public trust and faith in the U.S. Government.

Finally, section 78i(f) makes it clear that "Any person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in  violation of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section, **shall** be liable to any person who shall purchase or sell any security at a price  which was affected by such act or transaction."  


I am calling on you to do your job. The direct manipulation of GME and AMC stock prices is an on-going crisis that directly hurts the public interest and is AGAINST THE LAW. You must act now before it is too late.

Sincerely,

Your Average Retail Investor

New-ish to the market. I get the concepts but haven't ever dove into the details / DD.

More of an observation + question to those that know more about this than me:

&amp;#x200B;

DATA:

Trading volume of 1.1m

Outstanding shares of 102.27m

% Shorted = 88.58

&amp;#x200B;

Does this mean that 88.58% of the 102.27m shares are shorted? \~90.6m?

At a volume of 1.1m/day, if the volume was 100% short-closing, that would take,  +/- 3 months for them to be able to close all these shorts, physically is that right?

&amp;#x200B;

Not that I think it will take that long, I get that the options might expire way before that. I am just asking if, theoretically, these short positions couldn't even close at this volume for at least 3 months?

&amp;#x200B;

Trying better to understand the data and how it all relates to each other

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I see on Yahoo!'s finance page that volume is showing 34m? Am I looking at the wrong volume # above?

Title: Congrats on giving Citadel 10 million today in SLV. And in giving Melvin Capital 15 billion on GME.
&amp;#x200B;

[\(Screenshot taken from this article: https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-02-01\/citadel-s-silver-bet-exposes-rifts-in-the-wallstreetbets-army \) ](https://preview.redd.it/yoh2bz6tnxe61.png?width=593&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21fa7793ae1210cd5ce52e89f09cbf80aa2c0360)

With 6 million shares in SLV, Citadel made about 10$ Million dollars. But it pales in comparison to the enormous 15 billion  shredded off GME's marketcap. 

THEY ARE DIVING WALLSTREETBETS AND IT IS WORKING. GUYS, THE FIGHT IS NOT OVER, GME STILL HASN'T BEEN SQUOZED, SHORT INTEREST IS STILL VERY HIGH AT 50%, HIGHER THAN AMC... 

7.5 Billion dollars still need to be covered in shorts, don't let them get away with them!!

Title: GME - The Game Theory Scenario
Fellow Diamond Hands,

First and foremost, I have 2,000 shares of GME which I first bought around \~$90 as I learned about the short squeeze thesis. I know I will get a ton of hate for this, but in full transparency, I will hold these until the price dips below my reservation price of $100, at which point I will likely dump to at least get my cost basis back. I am hopeful that this wont happen anytime soon though.

I think whats going on right now is a complicated game theory problem. I am still thinking through this so would very much appreciate any input from anyone that I may have missed.

**Actors:**

**The shorts**, which include the Melvins, the Citadels, and the Robinhoods. The Melvins represent all the hedge funds that are short the stock (Viking, D1, Maple Lane, etc.). The Citadels represent the market makers that have to take on a net short position to ensure liquidity and volume in the stock as the price rides up, and the Robinhoods represent the brokerages that have to post up increasing amounts of collateral to clearinghouses, as they are ultimately responsible for  losses in major downward movements in the stock (e.g., if someone buys GME at $500 on 100% margin, they in theory should be called when the stock dips to $250, but in the case of a couple trading days ago, we saw it go from $500 to $130 very quickly, making it difficult to liquidate the position on time and resulting in substantial losses for Robinhood).

**The longs**, which include institutions and retailers. Institutions are all the good guy funds like Blackrock, Maverick, Vanguard, etc. that are long the stock. The retailers are us. 

I think we all understand the situation in that shorts are in a world of hurt. If short interest truly is 100%+, and costs of borrowing skyrocket, there really is nothing shorts can do here. They will get squeezed and we will get our tendies. If. We. Just. All. Hold.

That being said, the difficult thing here is the lack of communication and transparency that works against us. Id bet my left nut that Citadel is on the phone with Melvin, whos on the phone with Maple Lane, whos on the phone with Lone Pine coordinating every move, ensuring no one triggers the short squeeze. Theyve got more weapons in their arsenal as institutions to run things like ladder attacks which we all saw these past few days. Being on the long side, however, is a little more challenging. We need to have mutual trust across not just us, as retailers, which I think we have, but also with the long funds for which there is no open line of communication. Theres a chance that they could cash out their position for a solid gain with a willing short at a set price in an OTC deal. That would not affect the stock price but would dramatically reduce the short interest and leave us holding the bag at the end of the day. This is a very real risk that we need to have in the back of our minds.

The other wrinkle to this however, is that if a true infinite squeeze were to be achieved, all the short funds would go under. Robinhood would absolutely go under. And theres a great chance Citadel would go under as well. While thatll bring us tremendous amounts of joy, it would not bring Blackrock the same joy as their other holdings would surely come down quite dramatically.

I think the long funds have to understand this dynamic, and theyre clearly willing to play poker. They understand that theres still squeeze to be squoze before reaching that catastrophic scenario outlined earlier, but as soon as its in their best interest to sell (before short funds and Citadel go under), theyll get out. 

**My takeaway from all this is that there is still room to run here, which is why Im still in, but diamond hands from all of us are needed and we need to proceed cautiously.** Its an uphill battle to climb given our limited ability to buy stocks on certain brokerages and the shorts having an arsenal of weapons to use (including the Media), but if we have coordination amongst us, an unspoken coordination with long funds, and diamond hands, we should be able to rake in some tendies.

Very open to suggestions / questions / other theories.

Title: PSA: remember, shorts have two days to deliver. This was why there was no squeeze today.
**EDIT: I am not claiming that the squeeze will be squoze tomorrow (prepare to hold for weeks). My claim is that another gap up this week is guaranteed if we hold $300.**

**EDIT: you diamond hands really need to step up. If we break today, past two weeks will be all for nothing. As another post pointed out, shorts will do anything to break the 13-day failure to deliver chain, as otherwise the SEC will immediately force them to cover.**

With GME pushed above $320 Friday, a huge wall of calls were exercised. Anyone who sold calls is now deeply, deeply underwater.

The longs havent won the battle yet though: holders of the short calls (largely Citadel at this point) have **two days** to deliver the shares. (See source below).

If I was in their position, would I start covering today  and therefore trigger a gamma squeeze? HECK NO. 

Instead, If I was a short, I would kick the can one more day while I try one more hail mary. I will attempt a large short-ladder attack to at least push the price down (if not outright induce panic-selling). At the same time, I would approach a large institution with shares (think Fidelity or Blackrock), and make an offer for a large volume of shares.

By pushing the price down, I can reduce my losses, and at the same time strengthen my hand in negotations with institutions that can offer shares.

If the hail mary works, shorts can at least get away alive tomorrow without even incurring failure to deliver

However, if retail is able to kill them at $300-$320 by open tomorrow, there will be a gamma squeeze the likes we have never seen this week (probably not THE squeeze yet, but a squeeze nonetheless). 

Panic-buying will start. Not all firms will do this panic buying, but I figure there are enough smaller HF shorts who dont have a legal team to temporarily stonewall failure-to-deliver lawsuits. Those have no choice but to start covering.


**TLDR: no squeeze today because shorts still have one day of breathing room. Dont just , BUY until we are at $300**

GME

EDIT:  = 

EDIT: for those asking for source on that GME is a physically-settled option: see this: The SEC only granted cash-settlement on a specific set of ETF tickers  (https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nyseamer/2020/34-88131.pdf)

For info on the T+2 settlement days on see page 9 of 42 (or 15/48 for whole document) of this: https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/filings/orgrules/17/06/rule061417occdco001.pdf

Rule 903 governs the obligation of a Clearing Member to deliver when either a Delivery Advice or OCC directs that settlement be made on a broker-to-broker basis. It currently specifies the delivery date for physically-settled options as the third business day following the day on which the exercise notice was, or is deemed to have been, properly tendered to OCC. Rule 903 also generally specifies the delivery date for physically settled security futures as the third business day following the maturity date. Under the proposed rule change, these references in Rule 903 to the third business day would be changed to the second business day.

Title: GME rest in peace. LGND new front runner for highest shorted stock
Listen everyone, I know you retards are all holding GME as hard as your anal sphincters allow, but don't forget GME is still shit and you have to let it go at some point. I recommend you do it tomorrow at the open and grab LGND stock instead and here is why:

We always need a good reason for why we're investing. For the many who started sub $100 price point on GME, it was mostly because the short interest was through the roof at 140% when GME was at $5. That's fucking ridiculous. Because of that, there was strong potential for a short squeeze and a gamma squeeze even happened 1/22. Big applause to the retards who won that and drove the price of GME past $100.

Here is an example:  Melvin Capital closed their shorts on 1/26 when GME was at $148. If they were shorting since at least the start of January when it was at $17, then they lost $17 sold - $148 bought = $131 for each shorted stock they had. They bought at 148/17 = 8.7X how much they sold the stock for.

Ultimately, they motivated short holders to cover their position at a fat loss. However, shares short as a percentage of float still remained dummy high the same week. Why? Because new shorts came at higher price points of GME stock ($300+) than before. For those hedge fund institutions to be incentivized to cover their newer short position, GME would need to keep skyrocketing, at least into the $500 range to put pressure on their shorts at $300, and that isn't even 2x how much they sold the stock for. Remember, about 9X is when Melcin Capital finally threw in the towel.  If it does go that high and institutions do sell though, then they could  further carry it into who knows, maybe 1k+ where the moon awaits. Ok so if you're holding, goal is to get the stock to $500+ so that a short squeeze can happen. Remember, getting it to $500 won't happen because of a short squeeze.

This means that initial jump into a solid $500 stock price would need to be made mostly by retail investors, of which, have already invested into GME. Literally the WHOLE WORLD is on this boat including Europe and even China. Listen, if the hype was real enough to get global attention, that's the peak man! You're not gonna find more retail investors to jump onto the GME ship to carry it to $500+, there just isn't any more people. So, I don't think retail investors have the remaining capital to keep boosting GME stock price because its peaked its hype.

Still thinking GME has dummy high short interest and you don't care about what i've just said? Think again, more than half the shorts were covered Friday

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1vjhmhbcixe61.png?width=607&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ebdee3c6797eb0d2941d98f2991c29ce009e983

What does this mean? If capital is all tied up and gme isn't moving up, people will sell. If they sell, you already know what that means... its over.

So to save my tendies and maybe yours, I'll be the first to say I sold my GME stock and moved it all into LGND. Wtf is LGND? Fuck if i know. But I do know (as far as my research goes) they're now THE MOST HEAVILY SHORTED COMPANY.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g1bke9kgixe61.png?width=576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59909847a2ed8cba0924a8ff22b40d7d9ee23fb3

This was the whole reason why GME was a gem to begin with and it happened, that bitch mooned because we like the stock. But without the short position to help keep it bolstered, it doesn't have support like LGND does. The short position on LGND is at a super high 65% and most of those are from a month ago or before when the stock price was half. THIS MEANS THE SHORTS ARE PRIMED TO BE COVERED ALREADY! HOP THE FUCK IN BOYS. Positions = buy the damn stock.

TLDR; GME is dying. I like LGND stock better

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: LGND

To the many of you still thinking GME shorts are high AF and over 100%, thats because the information you're getting IS NOT UP TO DATE. The stock exchanges releases short interest data once every two weeks for the public to see. I paid to see data daily. GME short interest has declined sharply because shorts were covered. Here is a link to an article with a different graph than mine, same conclusion: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/gamestop-short-interest-plummets-in-a-sign-traders-are-covering](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/gamestop-short-interest-plummets-in-a-sign-traders-are-covering)

Second edit: for anyone that listened, congrats you saved yourself from getting fucked by after hours on GME

Title: GME will squeeze and here's the 10 reasons why I think so + rabbit-hole reading
TL:DR  = but read anyways.

My monkey brain has been reading wsb far to long and I decided to put together a quick list of reasons why I think the squeeze will happen (or not, fuck you I lick doors), I sourced everything so that if you learn to read in the next little while you can give it a shot with those. This is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor.

A) GME has been on the NYSE Threshold Securities List for over 35 days.  The streak of FTD (Failure to deliver) of shares continues. Where are the shares?

B) The last 3 trading days have had abnormally low volume. It's not coincidental that when the sentiment for $GME is at its all time high and price mooning, trading is/was being suppressed.  Last week was an obvious attack on retail investors ability to purchase shares and gatekeeping from upward momentum. An obvious tell that they would and did incur massive losses.

C) Since then we've seen Short Ladder attacks everyday to force stop losses and paper hands in order to cover as much as they can. We saw on full display the perversion of MM's/HF's trying to fuck the average joe for their negligent behavior. We've recovered every time. This is an orchestrated attack. This could of ended long ago if they just covered.

D) Brokers no longer have shares to borrow for short sale.

E) Speculation that the shorts have been trading counterfeit shares, this isn't a unique situation and I wouldn't be surprised is this is happening. They could be trying to cover their tracks of this as well as prevent catastrophic losses.

F) The losses incurred should strengthen your convictions about the thesis of $GME.  Melvin needed to be bailed out, RH CEO lied publicly about liquidity and required a bailout today. I'm sure more will also be taking further losses in the days/weeks ahead. HOLD STRONG, they are trying to bait you through volatility, disinformation  and attrition/fatigue. We are gamers HOLD STRONG, consider this a time-gated mission before getting your legendary weapon.

G) The aggressive and blatant ramp-up of disinformation through media is immensely revealing. The billionaires are scared and getting their stooges to throw all the FUD at the wall to see what sticks, to ensure we don't hit the "grand slam" as Cramer put it. They are shilling silver (perfectr example), stating arrogantly that reddit is in on silver while out of GameStop ,or both (the swaggystocks sentiment tracker shows the complete opposite) and finally of course saying last week that the shorts are covering. Today's media was down right egregiously incorrect.

H) A large amount of January 29, 2020 calls (strike 115-325) finished itm. These shares will require fulfillment by tomorrow. This is a huge amount of obligated buying pressure.

I) Bloomberg terminal still showing over 120% SI. However there will be a clearer update of the short interest in the coming few days. I want to say the date is Feb. 9, 2020.  IMO shorts have not covered.

J) FINALLY, THERE IS ONLY ONE GME. NOTHING ELSE REPLICATES THE CONDITIONS. I LIKE THE STOCK AND RYAN COHEN. FUNDAMENTALLY I BELIEVE GME WILL REPLICATE CHEWY.  ALWAYS HAVE A TARGET BUT I'M HOLDING. THIS IS A WAR, WE CAN REMAIN RETARDED THAN THEY CAN REMAIN SOLVENT BUT THAT STILL MEANS IT TAKES TIME. DONT BE PAPER HANDED AND STAY RESOLUTE.

I believe that these 10 factors are converging and I'm holding.

Title: Some actual evidence that GME isnt over yet: If you dont like whats being said, change the conversation
Seeing all explicitly negative news around GME and the positive news around SLV reminded me of this:

https://imgflip.com/i/4w9ip2

There is a ton of conflicting information, market manipulation, and other bullshit out there.  We will not actually have reliable data that the shorts are covered until this is all over (real short data is only published every 2 weeks and is already 2 weeks old by the time of publication).  How the fuck do we keep our emotions in check in the mean time?

One thing is for sure, there is a MASSIVE effort to divert attention away from GME and other meme stocks going on right now.

If these guys were truly out, they wouldnt give a fuck and would just walk away with their money like they have for the last 10 years.  People dont spend A LOT of money trying to tell people what to think unless they have something to gain.

Ill be selling at $1000+ or when I havent heard SLV or GME on the news for a week.  Thats when well know this has changed from retail vs hedge fund to retail vs retail.

Edit:  Stop giving me awards losers.  Except Silver.  I hear we are all into that now.

Title: The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation DTCC and Cede Corporation.
These are the shadowy bodies that are supposed to make sure shares in companies are correctly assigned when you buy and sell them. The DTCC is the body that leaned on Robinhood at 3am to force them to raise their capital covering. Probably leaned on a whole bunch of other clearing houses and brokerages.

This is what drove the shutting down of GME and other Reddit meme stock sales and avoided a complete meltdown last week.   


These articles explain how counterfeit shares are created and illegal naked short selling can occur.

i think the CEO of the DTCC needs to issue a statement to clear up illegal naked short selling.

Title: WHY YOU DEFINITELY SHOULD NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE FALL FOR ALL THE SILVER SCAMS!!! CAREFUL, YOU ARE BEING PLAYED BY THE MOST POWERFUL ELITE ON THE PLANET!!!
# THIS IS A META THREAD IN WHICH I'M JUST DOING 2 THINGS: RANTING AND LINKING TO OTHER DD THREADS THAT PREDATE GME MOONING BY MONTHS, THUS CALLING BULLSHIT ON THE 6 MILLION NEW DEGENERATES THAT "HAVE NEVER SEEN A SLV JPM SQUEEZE IDEA IN THIS SUB BEFORE THE SUITS WANTED TO SAVE MELVIN".

Do you realize reddit has a search function? Here is a list of posts that talk about a potential silver squeeze of SLV and JPM long, long, long before GME blasted off towards the moon. This is /r/wallstreetbets, not /r/GME. We trade multiple tickers, you dumbshit fucking "entry at $450" bag holding tards.

Great, you joined in the last 2 weeks because your autistic nephew made more money in 2 months than you've ever done.

Instead of just shutting up and watching the plethora of good DD posts rise and fall, you think this entire subreddit is only about holding one frickin' short squeeze as if that's the first time in history anyone got squoze, and downvote otherwise great research because you're frickin' terrified of losing money you couldn't afford to lose in the first place.

The entire global media didn't all pool together in 48 hours to present a uniform story of "buy silver" as part of some frickin' conspiracy designed to save a few medium-sized American hedge funds. No more than COVID was made by the Chinese to win Biden the presidency, anyway.

So here, since you guys are too damn handicapped to use a fucking search engine, are a list of DD/YOLO/Discussion posts about SLV and Silver written LONG BEFORE THE FUCKING GME SHORT SQUEEZE FINALLY ROCKETED!!! Jesus fuck, you tinfoil wearing sack of "fake news" American mouth-breathers with the collective IQ of a doorknob.

Just look at the fucking DD and pretend GME doesn't exist for 5 minutes. Silver. Is. A. Deep. Fucking. Value. Play! It has value. So much fucking deep value! 

Yeah, no shit a market maker is holding silver positions when silver becomes more sought after, their job is to make fucking markets liquid. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SUPPLY LIQUIDITY IF YOU DON'T HAVE SHIT TO SUPPLY?! DID YOU NOTICE HOW THEY HAVE A LOT OF PUTS AND A LOT OF CALLS, AND NOT JUST CALLS?!

DO YOU THINK NO BILLIONAIRES HELPED RIDE GME UP? Do you think it was 100% retail on one side and 100% Melvin and Citron on the other? Ah, you do. Of course, you do.  


GREAT, WE GOT 8 MILLION DEGENERATES HERE. The 6M that didn't manage to find this place without hearing about GME having rocketed already, MAYBE DON'T FUCKING POST, COMMENT AND BRING YOUR DAMN IGNORANCE INTO A SUB THAT WAS ACTUALLY PROVIDING 2-10 DECENT TRADE IDEAS PER WEEK PRIOR TO THIS CULT FUCKING INFESTATION OF JACKASSES COSPLAYING RETARDS.

Whatever, here's a list none of you fuckers are capable of reading:

\- 5 months ago, /u/negovany wrote "[Cornering Silver Market](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/idjk61/cornering_silver_market/)". The whole thing is about JPM and squeezing silver. $GME was at $5 back then and /u/DeepFuckingValue was still getting laughed at for buying at every opportunity. Rest of you fuckers had barely gotten over the last cult following, PRPL mattresses.  
\- 6 months ago, /u/lucasandrew talks about "[Why you should trade futures - WSB Edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i3qkex/why_you_should_trade_futures_wsb_edition/)", in which he mentions "*Speaking of SLV, people have been posting all the reasons that JPM fucks with the SLV ETF*". Yeah, I bet he took a fucking time-machine back 6 months in time after Citadel got stuck in the boo-boo. 

\- 6 months ago, /u/LE0TARD0 implores the "[SILVER CHAD'S RISE UP!](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hy7nvn/silver_chads_rise_up/)". A straight fundamental thread on why silver is undervalued, not mention JPM. However, in the comments, a thread is started by /u/kbtech18 and supplemented by /u/ayyayyron talking about precisely JPM and their price manipulation of silver. YEAH, NO THAT NEVER HAPPENED, I'M SORRY FOR BEING A SHILL, LIKE FUCKING TAKE YOUR TINFOIL HATS OFF YOU DUMB SHITS!

\- 5 months ago, /u/Fuzzers wrote "[September Silver Futures Contact - Something Aint Right Kids](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i9b1th/september_silver_futures_contact_something_aint/)".  
After hailing his fellow degenerates, HE IMMEDIATELY SAYS: "*I know there has been 6 billion posts about silver,"* before later writing "*A large amount of contracts will stand for delivery such as in July. If its enough, maybe some of the big banks who have short positions might find themselves in hot water with their silver delivery amounts.".* Isn't IT JUST GLORIOUS HOW MELVIN AND CITADEL HAVE ALL THESE TIME MACHINES TO MAKE UP IMAGINARY SILVER SQUEEZES 6 MONTHS BEFORE THEY WERE MADE UP? YOU GUYS ARE SO FUCKING DUMB RIGHT NOW, HOLY FUCK! DON'T INVEST IN SILVER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO, BUT PLEASE STOP WITH THE AMERICAN FAKE NEWS CONSPIRACY THEORIES, IT HURTS MY ALREADY FUCKED UP BRAIN, STOP, I DON'T CONSENT!

\- 5 months ago (YOU GUYS, MAYBE YOU ARE RIGHT, ALL THE POSTS ARE FROM 5-6 MONTHS AGO, MAYBE IT REALLY IS A TIME TRAVELLING CONSPIRACY BY MELVIN AND CITADEL, YES, LET'S GO WITH THAT!), /u/jetter23, wrote "[Weekend Update - Silver](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i6l0o2/weekend_update_silver/)". What did he have to share, in terms of ideas and DD? " *4a) Banks will continue to fight us on silver, but they are losing as they were massively short,*  ". WHAT SNEAKY FRICKIN' MARKET MANIPULATING HEDGE FUND SHILL HE IS, JUST GOING BACK SO FAR IN TIME TO SET US UP FOR THE PERFECT TRAP TO HELP CITADEL!!!

\- /u/jetter23 was quite active shilling 5 months ago, he also wrote "[Weekend Update - Silver (DD#3)](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i9uxok/weekend_update_silver_dd3/)", where he just casually mentioned "*JPM is currently under DOJ investigation AGAIN for price speculation on Silver. JPM is learning a VERY expensive lesson that when there is a pandemic, global FIAT currencies are crashing(like the DXY), and there is a run on physical metals - you can't be naked short on paper."* IT'S ALMOST LIKE HE'S TALKING ABOUT SOME SORT OF SILVER SHORT SQUEEZE ON JPM, BUT HEY, THAT CAN'T BE IT BECAUSE THAT'S JUST A SCAM FAKE NEWS IDEA THAT'S 2-3 DAYS OLD, RIGHT? 

\- /u/CCJ_Moon_6969 popped his head into the stream of tachyons, relatively talking to us from the present all the way 6 months ago, when he wrote "[Silver. $SLV call options. New York Comex.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hy8wv9/silver_slv_call_options_new_york_comex/)". Do you remember /u/kbtech18 from a few threads up? WELL, GEE WHIZ, HE COVERED THAT TIME STREAM TOO, talking about JPM and silver. 6 months ago. I mean, today. Reddit probably changed the timestamps on the posts. DAMN SHILLS!  
\- /u/rawvi wrote "[JPM and Silver](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i88cyy/jpm_and_silver/)" 5 months ago, wanting to learn more about... time travel. Nothing to do with naked shorting of silver. BECAUSE THAT WASN'T EVER TALKED ABOUT ON THIS UNTIL 2 DAYS AGO, SO LIKE... HAH, HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN ASKING ABOUT THAT, RIGHT?!?! CORPORATE SHILL BOT LOLOLOL!

WE LIKE THE STOCK!!! 

  
Don't buy silver, it's a time-traveling scam orchestrated by Kenneth Griffin!

Title: Some DD for your BB
Based on responses to my earlier post, I will preface this whole post with this  I AM NOT TELLING YOU TO SELL GME. HODOR THAT SHIT!

I got a lot of messages after my last post asking for thoughts of the big four, and BB is one that sticks out to me as having high value long term and not just through this current bonanza. 

Many of you have been seeing this ticker posted a few times called BB (blackberry for the less imaginative readers). Now, I am sure many of you new-comers to this sub probably are thinking What in tarnation? This phone company still exists? 

Yes. And the kicker? **BB is no longer a phone company**

In case you missed the news, BB is selling their phone stuff and going balls deep into automotive software. Not just any cars, but autonomous and EV. Every WSB autists wet dream.  I mean AI and EV in one company? No way this can go tits up!

If you look at older posts in WSB, you will see that BB was getting attention here for a while before the the current madness and many had high hopes that BB could rain in tendies in the near future. I am sure there are many here that have BB for under 10, which are probably the people who saw this potential. 

BB is selling away their phone patents to Huawei and partnering with Baidu (amongst other companies) to work on their autonomous driving technology. Specifically, BBs operating system will be incorporated to be the backbone of Baidus autonomous driving platform. 

The news does not stop with Baidu. This is merely one example of BBs expanding influence over autonomous driving, navigation, vehicle health protection, and vehicle security. At this point a simple google search with the words Blackberry + vehicle will net you dozens of results for projects they are working on and leading in the automotive software industry. 

All in all, I am very bullish on BB, especially long term.  What this all boils down to is if you think youve missed the boat on the big 4, BB may still be a good choice to jump in. Even if it pulls back, BB probably wont leave you bag holding for long. 

Good luck all and may the tendies be with you.

(This isnt financial advice)

TL;DR  Hold your GME. BB has long term potential after the current madness is over.

Title: Stay Away From Silver!
**Dont even think about silver.** Seriously it is not *the next GME.* As far as were all concerned, there may not be another GME for a decade at least. 

Silver is bullshit being pushed by the hedge funds and the media (who are in the pockets of the funds). It also has a massive amount of shares, and its hardly being shorted at all. It would take billions of dollars for anyone (not even necessarily us retards) to even start squeezing.

Have you noticed how the media is pushing that narrative so heavily? And how maybe once per day theres one shitty silver post? Its clear nobody in the media reads this sub, or if they do, they only have personal interests in mind.

In short do **NOT** listen to the media regarding anything going on in this sub, we know better than they do what goes on here.

This is not financial advice, Im just a retard that likes video games and movies. 

 Hold like your life depends on it.

Title: EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS: The Anatomy of a Short Attack
Seeking Alpha published a [summary](https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack) way back in 2014 (before many of you were born) about the anatomy of a short attack, and it perfectly encapsulates what is happening with GME. You can and should read the actual source which is linked in the article if you want even more detail. Great way to learn more about the underground bullshit funds have been getting away with for far too long.

In summary:

A consortium of hedge funds get together and plan a short attack by selling and buying counterfeit shares at lower and lower prices, driving the bid/ask artificially. With the disclosed short positions and the counterfeited shares, the true price of a stock can be manipulated much further than it should realistically should go. If the short attack meets resistance on the long side, they flood the market with their reserve of "strategic failstodeliver" shares and overwhelm demand. Usually they do these big attacks on big news days so that their fake volume is masked. But now, with GME, nobody is selling so all their action is out in the open!

They utilize '**Media Assaults**' which we have seen nonstop the past week with CNBC reporting 'sHorTs hAvE coVeReD' and now every outlet reporting on silver. It's all fake and these news outlets are in bed with the HFs. We've seen this evolve over the years to the social media bot attacks and disinformation campaigns. I'm sure the mods can attest to the thousands of bots they ban daily. I certainly saw them first hand in the Discord, promoting silver and other BS distractions.

There is a criminal **lack of transparency** surrounding short positions and the prime brokers, DTC, hedge funds all benefit. The SEC looks the other way because they are unfunded, powerless, and let's face it: they exist to protect big money.

**What can we do?** These events with GME and others have put these illegal and corrupts acts in the eyes of the public around the globe. The pressure needs to stay on these actions until something changes. The public should continue to voice their concerns to members of our government and push for more transparency and regulation against these outright malicious acts.

In the mean time, everyone should realize these ladder attacks are fake outs and are driven by miniscule volume. Everyone is, and should continue to HOLD (duh).

The article states that these short attacks are &gt;90% successful. Well, looks like they fucked up big time by betting the farm and landing a critical miss.

tldr: WE LIKE THE STOCK; GME

Title: REMX - The less volatile way to play derivates (rare earth metals) of the EV and Renewable Energy craze?
*\[Posted this on another Stock Market subreddit accidentally (now deleted from there)\]*  

Disclaimer: Do your own DD. I am not a licensed/certified financial advisor. This is not financial advice. Just may personal point of view.

\*\*\*

[REMX](https://www.vaneck.com/etf/equity/remx/holdings/) is a Rare Earth Metals ETF that gives any portfolio broad exposure to all major rare earth metal miners and players in China, Australia and some more (e.g US including Lithium Americas and Livent).

This saves one from the hassle of trying to track individual Chinese or Australian RE mining / metal extraction companies while giving access to an industry that will be a key supplier to the EV market in China and abroad. The output of these companies is also critical for the renewable energy (wind) sector and electronics to a certain extent.

For all the talk of the US bringing back supply chains (or relying on MP materials), this is one sector that cannot be brought back in the immediate to short term. The ETF hit highs of 92 in Jan 2018 and I expect that in a high liquidity environment with policy emphasis on electrification it will touch and exceed those levels. The ATH of 2011 is 300+ but I am not sure how relevant that might be today (but is a technical indication of the last time we had a media driven rare earth metals craze).

In summary

\- If you are not sure which Rare Earth mining company to pick or you want exposure to the EV secular shift but are not sure which SPAC or EV maker will go to the moon, consider REMX (rare earth metals ETF)  
\- Solid performer over the last months, currently going through a pullback (83 to 75)  
\- Moves slow but steady and has strong tailwinds  
\- Not super volatile so easier to get out of if you find a new shiny thing  
\- OTM calls are cheap  
\- Most recent high within the last 2 years was 92

Full disclosure: I have one deep ITM call for Aug 2021 and some shares (small account holder). The ETF has done nicely for me over the last few months (got in at 40), and this current pullback might be a good time to buy.

Title: $SPWR - high short interest, solid company, bright future, NO PSYOP
Before you retards scream about this post being a psyop or something, here me out. 

SunPower is a leader in residential solar. Climate Change is never going away. Boomers have turned their back on this problem at the expense of their children and grandchildren.

If you want to be an activist for real change in the world. Find solar/altenergy plays that are heavily shorted and offer real solutions to the problems facing the world.

$SPWR is currently over 50% short the float and at the time of this writing is offering a juicy dip for the intelligent retard.

This is not investment advice, do your own due diligence. I like the memestonks.

Full Disclosure: I am holding AMC/GME/PSLV for the cause

Title: The Rolling 20s - LEAPs on Cannabis
The Rolling 20s - Investing in US Legalization

Hi all! I believe the marijuana industry presents unique growth opportunity through legislative change. Heres why I am long the sector and eyeing options..

Last week, Chuck Schumer accounced that Marijuana Reform Bills are being merged as Congress moves to legalize.

This is massive news, in fact, Stifel is calling this a Goldilocks Scenario for companies like Tilray.

&gt;This could potentially foreshadow the most significant catalyst in the history of the U.S. cannabis industry

The ~~Roaring~~ Rolling 2020s 'Will Be Fueled By Weed' As Cannabis Experts Predict Regulatory Shakeups In 2021

&gt;2021 should be a year of ongoing regulatory movement; expecting 2022 to mark the biggest wave the reform movement has seen so far

The marijuana industry is a beaten down industry with banking restrictions &amp;amp; short interest through the roof. 

US Legalization is just around the corner and no one is talking about it. 

I strongly encourage everyone to research some companies and potentially get in before the media gets ahold of this story.

Here are a list of cannabis related companies you can look into with options:

Aphria, Tilray, Canopy Growth, Organigram, Aurora, HEXO

(Many MSOs still trade on the OTC, but will be pushing to uplist in the near future. Keep an eye on Curaleaf, Trulieve, Cresco Labs &amp; Green Thumb)

There are also ETFs available with US exposure such as $MSOS

Also, it is important to deepdive the management in this industry, as it is with any other. A good management with tegrity goes a long way. I wont go into detail, but, weve seen behind some curtains(walls) and it wasnt pretty.

Politico said Theres no stopping the industry now: Democratic control is a big win for marijuana 

Stay safe &amp; GLTA!

I am eyeing APHA 1/20/23 20 Cs @ 4.20 (currently long)

Check out that bullflag forming on the monthly.

Edit: Heres a list of other cannabis related companies... Verano, Acreage, TerrAscend, Harvest Health &amp; Rec, 4Front, Columbia Care, Sundial, Planet 13, GrowGeneration, Jushi, Vireo, Village Farms, Cronos

Title: GME and AMC is a dying horse. Anyone still in it bought at peak, now trying to increase the stock to unrealistic prices
[deleted]

Title: A theory on why investing in SLV isn't going to end well.
1. Citadel has a stake in SLV.
2. If we buy SLV and spike it up, Citadel will sell SLV to fund their GME cover which at this point they aren't able to hence the ladder attacks.
3. HFs like citadel know how market psychology works -that people are always ready to chase the next best thing so that's how they are peddling SLV along mainstream media to divert funds from GME to SLV.
4. What happens when Citadel sells off SLV - SLV will tank and you as a retail investor will lose money.
5. What happens if we buy GME - they are forced to cover, it moons, we as retail investors win.
6. What about AMC, BB,NOK - I personally believe in all 3 but I am long . BB has a contact with amazon and chinese EV manufacturer and has earnings soon.  NOK is the only 5G play along with Ericsson, AMC - vaccines are out and people have cabin fever, going to the movies is cultural and AMC is out of debt.
7. So invest in AMC, BB, NOK and not in SLV? - Nope, invest in GME coz thats the one going to the moon. Invest in AMC, BB, NOK for the long term they will moon but not right now.

Title: Questions on Short Float, Short Ladder Attacks and Short Squeeze.
Here are the main questions many have. Post will be updated with more answers and questions from the comments. This will help a lot of people!

#**Q1) The short float % seems to be going down from a number of sources. Why are these not correct?**

Responses:

- From u/kevinjing11: Short float % is what's publicly reported. Many ways that MMs and hedge funds can essentially fake this number through unreported phantom shares
- From u/Candle-Sticks: The short float % numbers we've been seeing are all estimates. The official reports don't come out until 2/9.
- From u/JesusHimself69: There's no way the hedges could have paid out their shorts that fast without the stocks rocketing up. Some on Thursday/Friday? Sure. But not over the weekend. It's just a scare tactic.

- From u/ whateverathrowaway00: 
http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html and 
https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf
The documents listed here show that the DTC ( central clearing house for stock trading ) has allowed counterfeit stock trading to occur for a long time. It is this environment that allows naked shorting to occur.
The SEC article above is from 2008 basically laying out how the restrictions put in place could be side stepped and it lines up. With this explanation, no one needed to call the DTC. There are no more shares of GME... period. Thats why even though short interest is being manipulated exactly as spelled out in the SEC paper above, there are no available shares to short in most brokers. The DTC raised deposit prices. They didnt need a phone call. Theyre not doing it to help any brokerages or hedge funds. Theyre doing it to save their own ass. This is an opaque company that has the ability to shrug off congressional subpoenas. Independant actors all acting for their own gain is a much more likely explanation then widespread collusion. This is what makes sense to me. DTC raised deposits, allowing the shorts to unwind over time. The media will vilify the brokerages and hedge funds and no-one will ever ask where all the shares are. If that tactic does not work they will crash the economy in response.


#**Q2) Can't the hedge funds just keep doing more short ladder attacks and drive the price down?**

Responses: 

- From u/FudgieThaWhale: No, because they're losing money doing ladders in an attempt to acquire additional shares. If investors don't sell a dip then they just flat lose the money. They won't keep doing it because they can't.
- From u/Candle-Sticks: The ladder attacks rely on the HF holding shares, they can keep selling and laddering until they run out of shares. Of course they can easily buy more at the dips they artificially create.
- From u/storyhungry: Interactive Brokers currently says that the borrow rate is 16.97% for HFs


#**Q3) All these hedge funds are saying they're out of their short positions to align with question #1, we obviously don't believe them and they're probably racking up a ton of fees. How long can they really last?**

Responses:

- From u/FudgieThaWhale: It can last as long as they want to pay margin fees. I imagine that won't be for very long.

- From u/autodrafter2020: There is a massive amount of Failure to Deliver, and short sellers have to pay the clearing houses soon, it could be just days: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

#**Q4) When the short squeeze happens, what period of time are we talking about? Does it last 10 mins, 2 days, etc?**


#**Q5) How do I know if it's a short ladder attack?**

Responses:

- Click and read through this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7bhj/gme_mms_have_until_tomorrow_22_to_buy_shares_it/glmatag?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3


#**Q6)  What % of the float do we need to own before this starts to squeeze (and is this publicly available)?**

Responses: 

- From u/thejewsdidnothing :It is possible (and likely imo) that we already hold over 100% of GMEs float. Why havent we squeezed? Because the shorts are able to dilute the float with fake shares as much as they want. The real question that should be asked then is at what point does the government step in to stop them, or when do the shorts accrue such heavy losses that they have to cover? The answer is that we dont know, but its only a matter of time.

#**Q7)  Why can't I buy more on Vanguard (relevant to other brokers too)**

Responses: 

- From u/Tainthairtwizzler : Vanguard no longer allowing you to use money transferred immediately. Just got off the phone with support and the funds need to be cleared through the 7 Day Hold before you can spend them. Must have been set over the weekend/today because I was able to buy BB from the same account but wasn't allowed to buy GME all during this morning.

#**Q8) Isnt it plausible that HF have been shorting at 300- 400$ level and are now taking in big time on their own ladder attacks to around the 250$ level?**

Responses: 

- From u/Thefsm93: It is possible that they have been shorting at 300-400, except that the volume of shares being traded doesn't match the volume of shares needed for the short. If the question is more geared at them buying in at 300-400 and trying to short at 250, that would just make this situation worse because they would still then need to BUY.
Plus, why would they be artificially driving the price down with ladder attacks?

#**Q9)  How does the short % of the float matter if there are approximately 10M shares to cover with?**

#**Q10) (from others) Im trying to get into the gme/amc craze but public / webull apps is taking anywhere between 1-7 days to confirm deposits before i can use the funds in my bank account. is this new? is there a way to expedite the process?**

Responses: 

- From u/waqas961: If you have a cash account linked to your bank on webull and you transfer an amount it will be available same day if did in morning or available next day as provisional funds to trade with until your actual deposit goes through which can take upto 5 days. I bought on 27th and 28th Jan but my actual deposits still show pending. Wire transfer however is different and for that you need to actually wait the whole time till it gets processed.
- From u/sutsusame: If you want to invest money right away, see if the brokerage will let you do a wire transfer. I use E*TRADE and incoming wire transfers usually clear within minutes, with no hold period. You will probably need to pay a fee to your bank.

#**Q11) What are some in depth posts that people believe should be read?**

Responses: 

- An insane amount of deception has been in the works for a long time: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

#**Q13) What happens if HFs have artificially created the counterfeit shares to the amount we hold which they exactly need and then when the short squeeze takes place, restrict all of us  and basically resell it to themselves and make our shares burn to the ground?**


#**Q14) What happens if the short squeeze takes place and all of the brokerage houses crash, as we have seen they have restricted us from buying? Wouldnt be surprised of seeing them not allowing us to sell at the most important moment. Btw, as we see that there is an insane amount of counterfeit shares, does that mean that this is hope they will save their asses by restricting the fake shares to be sold?**

Title:  REPORT ON GME (OVER 100 PAGES) 
[**Link to download the 100-page report.**](https://gofile.io/d/h8M6x3)

EDIT:

* **There has not been of lot of interest for the research I published. I am not going to lie, I'd rather move on to new investment opportunities and make money elsewhere rather than pushing something that the WSB community doesn't care about.**
* **There has been 1.5K likes on my 20-page research when GME was NOT mainstream and traded at 17/18$ vs. 0.2K for a 100-page document.**
* **I am not going to push my work given the metrics. This is basic supply and demand.**
* **For those of you who had interest in it, sorry but I think WSB is more interested in memes and gains/loss posts. However for those who are interested stay tuned, I will keep publishing my views about new investment opportunities (not financial advice of course).**
* **I will continue to defend WSB reputation and be against market manipulation.**
* Something important I want to had about the fundamentals of the company: with the buzz that GameStop have made, there is a real chance that its sales with perform better than expected. No valuation models, as far as I know, accounts for this because it's very difficult to price in.
* Updated the link with a new version (minor corrections).

Due to the increasing demand I am posting the EARLY VERSION of the full report, there will be an updated version later. The report contains the story of GameStop, my previous analysis on the company (from 3 Jan.) and all the references. For the analysis I included the work of GMEDD.com so that you have an updated version of the analysis on top of my previous one. I hope the boomers who say we can't do our own research will shut up now, even if I know they say stuff like this just because they lost big.

If you have any suggestions, corrections or feedback PM me. This is not investment advice. This is an organized collection of informations and my personal opinion on the matter.

Big shout out for those who supported me before the story became mainstream [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kps5bb/gme_almostultimate_dd/). Truly appreciate.

Title: $F ford and google partnership
Fellow Autists, hopefully theres still room for analysis outside of GME.  I purchased Ford on Friday based on a technical pattern hoping for a quick swing.  Today Ford announced a six-year partnership with a Google.  What was intended to be a short hold, has no turned into oh shit!...this could be huge. Everyone knows that every EV company out there has exploded higher over the last year including anyone with anything related to autonomous driving as a business channel.  $F has performed... well like ford. The stock is in the 10s.  However this could change things big time.  

With further initial research I found that Fords head of global design Moray Callum (square looking old white guy in a suit) has retired and they have recently hired Anthony Lo.  I looked into this guy and he has led the design of some badass cars Ive seen, including this one https://www.saabplanet.com/saab-aero-x-anthony-lo/

Im still putting the pieces together and doing my DD but is $F a potential big time tendie over the next few years?   Anyone have thoughts?  This may be a   type of a purchase.

Title: A quick word about the current silver situation. (DD)
Despite all the shit being tossed around here about silver, here is the deal.

There is a VERY real situation on the available PHYSICAL silver you can buy. The stock SLV is so trash, it doesn't even keep up with Physical silvers price.

TD Precious Metals has been down for 2 days. Online stores are VERY low on stock.

&gt;In response to the rapidly-evolving COVID-19 situation, the TD Precious Metals digital store is currently unavailable, but please check back later. Thank you for your patience

Locally you could call up your silver dealers and a lot of them are simply NOT SELLING! It's WILD. Just think, about this idea. let it ponder. Back in the day, 1 oz of silver = 1 dollar. If 1 OZ of silver was worth even 1% of our monetary system it would equal 2 MILLION DOLLARS an OUNCE!

Buying silver right now is insurance you have for THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. You really can't go wrong.

If even 6M people (IN THE WHOLE WORLD) bought 1500 worth of physical silver, the shortage would be SO GREAT, the price would increase over 1,000 / oz.

[https://www.mining.com/silver-is-now-even-more-precious-than-gold-do-you-own-any/](https://www.mining.com/silver-is-now-even-more-precious-than-gold-do-you-own-any/)

&gt;**Constraints in Supply**Why cant we just mine more silver? The reason we cannot fix the problem by mining more silver is the cost. Today for example, to mine gold, it takes $350 \[to $450\] to mine, refine, and bring to market one ounce of the yellow metal. With gold trading around \[$1200\] an ounce, that is a profitable endeavor. Silver however, is mined \[primarily\] as a by-product. In order to mine one ounce of silver as a primary metal, the cost associated with it is similar to the cost of mining one ounce of gold and with silver trading around \[$17  $18\] an ounce and would not even be close to profitable when the mining costs are factored in. Currently we mine around six hundred million ounces of silver each year while industry consumes about eight hundred and seventy million ounces. Can you see a disparity developing? The market is tightening.

***TL;DR Read the constraints in supply, and this -&gt; 130% of YEARLY silver harvested, is used in Industry!!***

We were expecting a short ladder attack. It has happened every day since Wednesday 1/27.

We won last week. We made all calls between 115 and 320 strike expire in the money. That means MM has to buy shares in order to hedge against those expired ITM calls.

It can happen anytime TODAY or TOMORROW.

Title: Vanguard no longer letting you trade stocks on new money in account.
EDIT 1:50.  I'm dumb.  Purchase that went through this morning and a Limit order that's already in is counting against my available balance. Wire funds usable for trade today. 

EDIT 1:30pm : Wired money into my account, still can't trade. On hold with Vanguard now.

Transferred some more money from my bank into my Vanguard account this weekend.

Just spent the morning trying to buy the dip.

&gt;"This order can't be accepted because it would exceed your current available balance. "

Talked to a rep at vanguard, and as of TODAY At 6am, you can't buy with money until it's cleared your account (aka 7 days.)

So wire money into your account, rather than transfer it.  

Just an FYI.  Yes, I understand why the changed it.  But no, I don't like it.

AND IT is especially funny, because my limit for GME went through this morning. . .using the same money.

I'm a trained monkey, this isn't advice.

Title: MORE TRICKERY: GME attack explained
REPOST FROM FRIDAY NOW THAT IT'S RELEVANT. u/SNICKYSNACKS THE PREDICTOR. 

BUY THE FUCKING DIP. THEY'RE PUNISHING THE RETARDS THAT HELD CALLS TO EXPIRY WITHOUT ALSO HOLDING ENOUGH MONEY FOR THE SHARES.




**TL;DR**
&gt;Not investment advice. Market goes up and down, I think GME will go up. But this is to protect the true retards that held FDs through to expiry on a low budget account.

&gt;They could potentially do a short attack to lower the prices enough that brokers margin call the owners of ITM calls on Monday. You can short the float for 100 shares, essentially making yourself delta neutral to protect yourself, then you get rid of them both on open with full gains.

Price is down $20 AH so be prepared for the morning dip. More scare tactics.

So, if institutional investors want to punish the retail investors they need to do it in a way that the retail investors have trouble countering.

In most cases, they would try to get the strike to where a majority of the open options positions would expire just under the strike with the most interest to keep people from having them executed and making money (in this case, the target would be &lt;$320)

But my theory is, since there is a huge short interest, it's better for the big players to let GME finish above 320 which causes the largest open interest (300, 320) to all get auto-exercised.

Most retail traders don't know how to prevent the auto-exercise, so this causes a bunch of people to buy the stock at 300 and 320 (and various other strikes, under the 325 closing price)

Then they short the price down hard and buy to cover at the lower price in after-hours market, which has much less exposure to the retail investors. Right now the price is down to ~300.

This allows them to gain a profit of ~$20 right now on the execution of those 320s and potentially more, if the price continues to drop.

If the price actually tanks well below 300, this will additionally trigger margin calls Monday morning on the people assigned the shares at 320 and generate maximum profit for the short sellers.

It's too early to determine if this will happen since it would require a hell of a sell-off, but there is clearly an absolute ton of pressure to lower the price after hours to punish those who were holding 300 and 320 calls.

To give a more concrete example of how to manipulate the price:

HF buys GME when it dipped under $150.

HF sells GME 320 calls after it goes back up, for $$$$

Market pins GME at 325 at expiry, forcing auto assignment of 320s

Instead of allowing the cheap GME to be called away, they force the price down after hours.

They buy shares to cover their short calls at a discount, since they will get $320 for them.

Price was bouncing pretty hard between 300-320, but creeping back over 320 now. Should be quite interesting to see if it holds.


**u/snickysnacks
get in here so they don't think I wrote this.**

I'm long GME. This is opinion only and not investment. I'm also not responsible for any temporarily capped gains because you don't understand the words delta neutral.

Title: GME short interest news - use with caution
Before going into news about short interest, I want to make clear that this data is generally not exhaustive and can never be seen as real-time. Also in light of the diversion and fake news tactics we can now observe, e. g. concerning silver, all data has to be regarded with caution.

Short positions have to be filed officially but with some delay. The last official update is from January 15th, 2021 and showed around 123% of GME float shorted. In the meantime, market intelligence firms provide reports about estimated short interest, which they sell as a product along with news and analytics services. Among these firms are IHS Markit Ltd. and S3 Partners.

According to Markit, short interest is now about 39%, S3 Partners states around 50%. Both values would be well elevated compared to the rest of the market. We also don't know to what extent these alleged numbers include new short positions at higher prices.

However, since the enormous short percentage of GME and the extreme increase in price, it can be argued that the short squeeze is not over and will continue, if the stock price stays elevated.

The short squeeze will only be over, if the shortsellers have abandoned old positions and are comfortable in new positions, if the intend to open them.

GME's stock price over time is one of the deciding factors here. If the price moves in favour of shorts still holding their positions, the may decide not to close them. If price stays elevated, additional shortsellers may need to close their positions, sending the price up.

\#WeLikeTheStock

\#Edit 1: For anybody criticizing this post: the percentages are, regardless if the allegedly came down, extreme numbers. It is logical that the massive increase in share price came due to some positions being closed and therefore Hedge Funds suffering. But the shorts are still in and that is why they use all their foul play. Someone on here recently deducted how high the percentage of retail holders could be. It was estimated 10 shares per user. The float is only 50m. The big squeeze is not off the table. Don't jump to conclusions because my post doesn't contain rockets and so forth. The best rocket is the one in your portfolio.

Title: BANG is BS. SLV is BS. There is only one squeeze. Game  Stop.

There is only one stock that can squeeze to infinity. You know what it is. 

Look, if you are a well intentioned or a confused autist, I get it, you want to make money on whatever it is. But AMC is not on DFV's DD. BB is not. NOK is not. Fucking SLV certainly is not.

Title: Incredible AMD financial report that seemingly flew under the radar during all these GME posts
Haven't seen a post about something other than GME since this sub was flooded by millions of people, so I figured I would mention something new. AMD, yeah remember the company everyone seemingly forgot about despite posting huge growth consistently in 2020? Well they recently had earnings and suffered bigly along with most tech. Some highlights from their earnings:

* Record revenue for the year with $9.76 billion in revenue
* Q4 Revenue up 53% to $3.244 billion (also record quaterly revenue)
* Gross profit up 53% to $1.451 billion
* Net income up to $1.78 billion compared to $170 million a year ago
* EPS up 867% (yes that is right) to $1.45 per share
* Cash flow up to $554 million YoY
* Q1 2021 guidance: 3.2B in revenue (79% YoY) and 46% gross margin
* FY'2021 guidance: 37% increase in revenue YoY
* Lets not forget their recent acquisition of Xilinx that will put them in a great position for the future

Su bae has been delivering hard on her promises, and I see no reason for this momentum to not carry forward into 2021. They have gone on sale after earnings, and I can't wait to see what AMD has in store for 2021.

Title: GME price target $2,797.70 after short squeeze.
GME is no longer just GameStop. It is a revolution! It is regular people against the establishment. It's the unemployed bankrupting hedgefunds. Throw away your old valuations and look at this new. This is a movement....and there's fucking value in that!

How high can this go? This is where Ryan Cohen shines. We never know how far he will take this, but I know the dude is fucking brilliant. So fucking brilliant that I'm willing to give him my entire 401k to make this happen.

GameStop is no longer a retailer, it is a viral company. We need to value it like a viral company. Look at Dollar Shave Club. (Almost) everyone buys razors and doesn't give a shit where they come from. But DSC changed everything. People WANTED to buy razors from DSC. I believe we will WANT to buy from GameStop. Fuck, I love this company (and stock) so much, if GameStop starts selling razors, I will buy them.

Dollar Shave Club was sold to Unilever for $1billion when sales were around $100million ($200million projected). I believe GameStop has more value. They are going to increase sales 3x or 4x. They will increase their online presence and start selling more products. This is going to be huge. My valuation of GameStop is 15x current sales, or $1,398.85 per share and my target price is $2,797.70 within 2 years. 

The short squeeze will push this stock even higher, but for the long term the current price is a bargain.

I'M HOLDING THIS STOCK!

I know GameStop is a good retail company and I'm confident they will grow after this, but it is also personal. The criminals who paused my trades need to go to jail. When they get out, I want them to see a fucking GameStop store everywhere they go. Every shopping center, every mall, fucking everywhere! I want Gamestop to be bigger than Walmart. To do my part, I will buy everything from Gamestop. If they sell toiletpaper, I'll fucking buy.

$300/share is a bargain.
Buy GME and hold

Not financial advice, do you own research
I eat crayons when no one is looking
HOLDING 150 GME @99 FOREVER! 
Love you all!

Title: Tilray Receives the First and Only Market Authorization to Offer Medical Cannabis Products in Portugal
Tilray stock was up over 10% at its highest during premarket today. 

With the incoming acquisition of Aphria, Tilray will become the largest cannabis company in the world.

Tilray was also selected by the French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified medical cannabis products in France last week.

With a short volume ratio of 31%, Tilray is a heavily shorted stock with potential to be squeezed hard

Title: BOOM (DMC Global) Fundamentally exposed opportunity due-dil #DYOR
Hey everyone!

I spent the weekend looking for good opportunities to flip wall street. I set out looking for stocks that have good technicals to pull off a GME style short squeeze. I think DMC Global Inc, trading as BOOM (yep, that really is the ticker), is our best play. Here is why.

To find a play, I am looking for companies that are way over shorted, that arent too big and that could be squeezed by a WSB onslaught. I looked for these things:

1. Stock where there is **more than 100% institutional hold**, which indicates naked short selling
2. Stock where there is **more than 15% of float that is openly shorted**, these are shares that have been borrowed and shorted.
3. Stock with a **reasonable market cap** so we can move it, smaller is better here.
4. Any other factors revealed by a review of the company.

I am not an investment advisor and I am not giving any investment advice. #DYOR I have an MBA and know how markets work. Im a geek who got into coding and finance in high school and working and investing for more than 20 years. I bought my first Jag with investment gains and people asked if I was old enough to drive it! I also got screwed over multiple times by banks and institutional investors. In 2008, I lost 3 years of my hard work investing when a broker closed out some of my positions at the worst possible crashing moment (to protect me!) and left me holding a bag of shit. I watched my broker front run my trades. When started with OTC, I saw them settle their prop desks least favorable trades of the day to me. Robinhood didnt invent this stuff. If youre in this to change Wall Street, lets break their trades and take back the markets.

First, I think targeting companies like Nokia is a bad idea. **NOK has a market cap of 25.6 billion and not enough shorts on it. It will be very hard to move such a monster. BB is another case with few shorts and almost 9bil mkt cap.** AMC with a cap of 4.5 billion is already a challenge. GME was around 2 billion when we started this and its 22 billion now - very hard to hold at this level. We have to ask: **How big is this challenge - a mountain or a boulder? and Whos on the other side of  the trade and how deep?** Keep these questions in mind before we move.

Secondly, **this is not long term investing** \- we are playing a hard game vs. wall street. Its about momentum and trade positions. Company data doesnt matter: EPS, EBITDA, cash flow - it doesnt matter for a short squeeze trade. With GME, we have given the company a great opportunity to raise funds and pivot, but its future depends on management. We bankrupted Melvin. That is our achievement. Our goal is hitting the crooks on the other side of these trades: Citadel, SAC, Robinhood, etc. The company is just the football in this game.

Two interesting companies are Teradata Corp and Allogene Therapeutics Inc. These are short squeeze opportunities as well. TDC, has a 105.98% institutional and a 19.46% short interest with a cap of 2.9billion. TDC is almost 4x bigger than BOOM, so it will be harder to move with lower beta and a lower institutional so moves will have less impact. ALLO, has a 61.46% institutional and a 19.52% short interest with a cap of 4.9billion. Price action is not aggressive either but Allogen 8x bigger than BOOM and could be much harder to move.

After looking at these and several other candidates, I found the best option, one that I believe could be successful in less than 3 days. It is DMC Global Inc. (NASDAQ:BOOM)

1. **DMC has 114.49% institutional hold** \- this means that there are hedge funds that have big short positions on this stock, many of which are naked. Naked shorts create the phantom shares representing 15% more than the float. Naked short is when you short the stock and the lender who let you short sell the stock actually didnt deliver the stock to you. This creates phantom shares. *Let me say that again:* there are 115% of the issued shares in play, that extra 15% in play *does not exist, but is owed*. These shares have been short sold without actually having shares to sell.
2. **DMC has 17.46% Short Interest**, so pretty heavily shorted. This means that pushing the stock up will squeeze that like a big zit on a small face.  This is way bigger % than NOK and BB who have a little zit on a big face.
3. **The market cap is just around 1 billion**. It wont take huge volume to squeeze this one.
4. Other interesting features are a) **beta of 1.3**. The stock historically moves more than the market and b) recent price moves are up, but the **stock hasnt had any crazy big run**, so there is a lot of room to push this up really fast. c) fyi: DMC has a real business manufacturing metal parts and accessories using explosives for the energy industry,
5. **It trades under ticker BOOM. This is a poetic bonus for this story.**

After looking at these and lots of others. I concluded that the best play is BOOM, its just like a ripe cherry waiting to be picked. I can find no better chance of success than this: a perfectly sized company that is as leveraged and as owned by hedgies as this. **I put this out for everyone and let the WSB mods decide.** The situation wont stay like this for long in these volatile markets, so if we decide to act, it must be now. Lets make this week another one for the history books. This is our moment. Lets change the world, one BOOM at a time!

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit**: Position long: GME, BOOM, G bee tee cee, NO SHORTS and NO UNDIES EITHER.

Title: Incoming $SLV short squeeze 1000% ? Come in ape don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.

Title: lot's of controversity on silver in here, here's my point of view
So there's a lot of controversy going on regarding the idea of a silver squeeze. After what happened with gamestop, I'm convinced that this shit really might work out. On the other hand there are a lot of people thinking that this is just something to draw attention away from GME and withdraw fund from the stock. Let me assure you this is not my attention. And if you're all about GME I suggest reading here because it's a waste of time.

I personally think that slv really might be the next big thing that could work out. Therefore I'd suggest to not go against the idea generally. Keep your hands at gamestop as long as you want, but once work is done, get together into this next big thing.

\*\*Here's what happens or might happen:\*\*About the theory of the silversqueeze. Can't really be compared to the GME squeeze as it is not about squeezing out hedgefunds shortsellers in particular. The idea is that the silver price is priced way too low for the amount of silver that physically exists. The silvermarket volume on paper (exchanges/Futures..) is 250 times bigger than the supply of physical silver (just read this and didn't do my own DD if numbers are correct). The Idea is that a physical shortage will be caused and this would really let slv skyrocket with all that derivatives that are not backed. Now imagine some 7 million apes and the following retail investors that come after suddenly plunger the physical silver market...

Example: Let's assume there is a shortage and Person A wants physical delivery of the future he bought. Person B as the seller needs to deliver 5000 ounces of silver. If supply is short, the person buys another future from Person C in order to be able to deliver the slv needed. You understand the reaction this causes.

Also the silver market is said to be manipulated and kept low for a long time. I have no opinion on this.

\*\*What happened on the weekend?\*\*Silver already surged 20% since friday morning which was most likely a result of the news of "Wallstreetbets taking over silver" and "Shortage in silver supply".example: [https://twitter.com/bitpanda/status/1356023060814585859](https://twitter.com/bitpanda/status/1356023060814585859)Also I noticed several locals stores and online stores being sold out completely on silver and it looks like this is not only regarding a few small dealers.[https://www.theepochtimes.com/reddit-forum-sparks-physical-silver-shortage-on-major-dealers-websites\_3679079.html](https://www.theepochtimes.com/reddit-forum-sparks-physical-silver-shortage-on-major-dealers-websites_3679079.html)Also social media generates a lot of heat.

So it look's like it's happening - if we're heading to a global shortage, prices could absolutely go to the moon and this is a big time chance to be with it at the beginning right now. Additionally there is a good chance that shortsellers have learnt from what was happening with GME and they might get out of their short positions earlier which will generate further momentum.

**What you can do** in order to participate and make this work:It does not help the cause if you buy mining companys (even though it might generate good income). But still, in order moon the prices, you'll need to invest physically. The options are:\* Buying silver futures and let it physically deliver. Only possible if you can easily invest some 150k.\* Buying slv or pslv if you live at the hamburgers, and for instance "Xtrackers physical silber" if you're from Europe. It's really important that you check if the fund needs to fully physically cover it's assets (=buy silver). Because not all do so.\* The next option is to physically buy silver at your local store or webshop.\* At last, you can buy options. Your counterpart might want to hedge the positions and therefore will potentially be covered. This is also obviously the part where you can win big time (or lose everything). My weapon of choice is:  34.00C expiring in April

I prefer a mix of above.

But as we all know, I'm just another ape sharing brainfarts, hence I'm definitely not in the position to give financial advice. Also I'm long on slv, silver options and bought the silver of some local shops.

TL;DR:This post is **NOT about GME**. No selly selly - I get the hype! But silver might be one of the best chances for the upcoming weeks I believe. And today it's still a chance to get in early at low prices.

e/okay, guess we have to wait until GME is through. Looks like most in here aren't open for a new relationsship. Anything that's not GME/AMC gets downvoted to hell. ITT: People with weak hands scared of any funds going from gme to slv - this is ridiculous.  

e2/ Thx for gold, even though silver would have done it!

Title: Evidence of Massive Naked Short Selling Fraud in GME and AMC
First of all, major credit to u/johnnydaggers for the [original DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/) If you haven't read that yet, go take a look.

Inspired by his analysis, I wanted to investigate the SEC's publicly available Failed to Deliver data and see how it compared to other companies over time.

I wrote some code to process the the raw SEC data and normalize the shares that failed to deliver by the total number of outstanding shares of the company. This gives us a view that where each company's FTD shares are expressed as a percentage of the outstanding, so we can fairly compare companies to one another.

(Before you ask, yes I account for fluctuating values of outstanding shares.)

I went back to the beginning of 2019, looking at a few of the recent meme stocks with short squeezes as well as the top 10 (by weight) in the S&amp;P 500 as well as GE (as an example of a stock with very low short interest). Here's what I found.

[This is not normal.](https://preview.redd.it/9us7kdme1ue61.png?width=2554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddf843285adac642c3d15360c71e14ed04566a38)

Shares can fail to deliver for many reasons, but when large numbers of shares fail to deliver a likely explanation is naked short selling. For a thorough explanation of this, see [this article](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html).

Back in early 2019, both GME and AMC look like the others. All had sub-1% of their outstanding shares end up as FTD. But starting in mid 2019, both GME and AMC experienced three waves of progressively larger naked short selling attacks. This is known as [scaling in](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scale-in.asp).

I wanted to see if I could find corroborating evidence of news and price data which aligned in time with these waves of naked shorting. What I found were two stories, both similar, explaining how GME and AMC got to where they are today.

# GameStop

The first wave (small bet) of naked shorts occurred in June and July of 2019. GME reported Q1 '19 earnings on June 4th after hours, with a [bleak future outlook](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/06/05/gamestop-stock-plunges-nearly-percent-gamers-brace-new-era-consoles/). Overall sales was down $1.5B, net income plunged by 78%. This story is what formed the core of the bear thesis. The stock dropped 36% on the news.

[GME Q1 '19 Earnings. Oof.](https://preview.redd.it/vbrosels1ue61.png?width=2804&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b04f103567aa52b8af929191f14fbae86a41f0e4)

But things changed when Q2 '19 earnings came around. Yes, sales were down again and the numbers didn't look good, but the company announced it was going to [reboot with a major strategic update](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/09/10/1913815/0/en/GameStop-Reports-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2019-Results.html). They were going to make their retail stores more efficient by closing some locations, focus on becoming a social hub for gaming, and build a digital platform around the relaunched GameStop website.

Investors liked the news and the stock tries to move upwards, but is repeatedly beaten down. This lines up with the second wave of naked shorting. The original short sellers couldn't let the price float up, so they resorted to more than doubling down on their original naked short bet to keep the stock trending downward.

[Naked Shorts double down, gotta drive it to zero faster than they can rebuild!](https://preview.redd.it/p6x5x8zw1ue61.png?width=2772&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=382b78b87a737dc480f85bccea573096ca681706)

Finally COVID hits the US in March and April. Lockdowns happen and it becomes clear that nobody is going to malls anytime soon. This is where the third and final massive wave of naked short selling happens, attempting to push GME into bankruptcy. Remember, that's always the goal with naked short selling. If the company goes bankrupt, especially with a convenient parallel story ("It was a failing company anyway and COVID was the nail in the coffin!"), then nobody bothers to look into how many counterfeit shares might be floating around out there. They aren't worth anything, so who cares!

At its peak, **over 20% of the company's entire outstanding shares were failing to deliver every month**. This is confirmed by a tweet from Michael Burry (since deleted, he scrubs his tweets) that says when he tried to recall his lent-out shares, it took his broker **many weeks** to locate them. Remember, companies normally have well below 1% of their outstanding shares fail to deliver every month.

# AMC Entertainment

To understand how we got here with AMC, you need to look back further, to 2017. AMC has been struggling to be profitable for a while. They had a history of posting very small net profits along with many net losses. Their cash on hand was hovering around $300M and their corporate borrowing had been going up.

[Trying to hard to not lose money.](https://preview.redd.it/g7zugy792ue61.png?width=1876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f580cf12bad13197ed1426466d8b183a4191933e)

[Surely borrowing will make this problem go away!](https://preview.redd.it/jtgjqlu92ue61.png?width=1876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93a8ac04fd426390354024ce016a2a08df36c79f)

What coincided with the first small naked short bet on AMC in June/July of 2019? Their cash on hand just dipped below $200M (from being stable around $300m). The last time that happened, AMC more than doubled its corporate loans. The short hedge funds smelled blood in the water.

The second bet, where the naked shorts doubled down occurred in November of 2019. What happened then? AMC Q3 earnings, which showed that cash on hand had dropped to a precipitous $100M. Bankruptcy was in sight for the hedge funds...

And then COVID hit. Their massive third wave bet was similar to GameStop, though slightly more delayed. Why? May 2020 was the peak of naked short selling, around the time when some businesses were able to reopen with restrictions, but it was clear that **movie theaters**, among a few other things, would be staying closed until the pandemic was completely over.

Also like GameStop, at its peak **over 20% of the company's outstanding shares were failing to deliver**. This is not normal.

# Conclusion

I think the evidence shows there is a strong reason to believe that one or more hedge funds, probably in collusion with broker dealers or the DTCC, have been deliberately naked short selling both GME and AMC since mid-2019. They made small bets to start with in the first wave, doubled down a few months later, but stupidly went all-in for the kill when COVID hit the US. It presented a unique scapegoat that nobody would question for pushing a failing mall retailer and a dwindling movie chain out of business.

Where does this leave us? I don't know. Unless this results in some kind of economic crisis (and I'm beginning to think it will), I don't see anything getting seriously investigated or changing. This is the same crap that happened with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008, but nobody was went to jail for it. Of course they were going to keep doing it.

**This is not financial advice. I eat crayons and paste.**

Positions: 100 GME @ $36, 500 AMC @ $2.75 (but I wrote $3 calls before it mooned... GUH)

If anyone wants to play around with the code or data I used to generate the first plot (monthly normalized failure to deliver data), [I put it on GitHub](https://github.com/bobsomers/evidence_of_naked_short_fraud_in_gme_and_amc).

Title: $GME Caution (actually just Gay Bear) reporting in with some DD
**TLDR: "CoNtrARiaN" but actually just a
dick-eating bear thesis that the SQUEEZE has in fact, been ALREADY SQUOZE.**

_Let me preface that for all the 5M newbies to this sub, I
am saddened that my favorite sub since 2017 has been invaded by normies. But at
the same time, I am excited for all the new amount of fodder (yeah, you) for
memes. So WELCOME TO THE GANG, GANG &amp;lt;3_

**

THESIS: The big short squeeze has already happened.**

**

When?**

Approximately from the when our lord and savior Burry probably cashed out
(sometime before his settlement date for 13-F filing coming out in 2 weeks
time) to when the news broke and Cramer shat his pants on CNBC last Monday.

**

Why do you think this?**

First, MELVIN was NOT the ONLY ones SHORT, they were just
the slowest ones to cover (and hence probably will continue to be the poster-child for
bukkake gang-rape by millennials and zoomers with stimmy checks).

Second, GME literally went from $5 per share to $37 per
share by January 15, 2021, the settlement date for the latest short float
update (Ill come back to your fucking daily updates from S3 Partners and Ortex
later on, and why I dont trust them).

To put it into perspective for these unscrupulous, criminal,
BIG money positions on the short-side that have been here a LOOOONG time,
thats already a 750% loss.

If someone had put in **JUST** $1M in August 2020 (by the
way, the short float % was around 99% at this time, so I KNOW more got in short
after this) hoping for a Gamestop bankruptcy, by Jan 15, 2021 these fuckers
would have lost $8M in total (initiating position would have been about 200K
shares short, by the time it gets to 1/15/2021, $37 x 200K shares = $7.4M.

So, by wagering $1M on the short side, you now have to buy
back and return your shares. You now have a $6.4M loss.

**WELL THAT FUCKING SUCKS? Right? Well then what does a 400-IQ,
uncircumcized-dick hedgie with a wedgie want to do about this situation? They
GOTTA make that loss back SOMEWAY SOMEHOW.**

You could suck trucker dick or deal drugs, but these
white-collar yuppies have enough power to NOT have to stoop down to that level.

**

Here is how they CAN, and probably ARE, doing it right
now:**

Melvin wasnt the only short position. Just the most
retarded one that didnt cover in time, so they had to go through a whole
fucking liquidity crisis, class action lawsuit, and dick-eating meme-fest while
literally asking for sugar-daddy money. What about the less retarded short
positions? Well, they probably have some losses too, because I mean, they did
get squeezed in the earlier portion of the play, but now they have sights on
something else.

**First, your hedgies (excluding Melvin &amp; Citron)
continue to push the narrative: Throw Melvin &amp; Citron to the masses and
keep the retail investors coming in with their diamond hands and high school
diplomas.**

Second, **hedgies go LONG on GME shares now**. WTF HOW?
Well remember that for short positions, there are LENDERS of these shares.
These lenders would happily let go of their positions at the top of a
squeeze. (Its ez fucking profit, and they want none of this mess).

Third, you now have a long position with underlying shares.
Whats the best play here? You fucking write call options because the vol
premiums are literally mooning at the moment. And Ive been on WSB long enough
to know that WSBs risk management is literally just selling one-paired organ
to afford the option premium on FDs.

Lastly, you push the narrative of a GAMMA SQUEEZE which is
JUST a little bit too hard for your average joe from Mississippi to understand
with his Algebra 2 from high school  Essentially telling him, HEY THERES
STILL MORE TO SQUEEEEEZE.



**

REAL Gs MOVE IN SILENCE:**

Look at the volumes, the float rotation in the past week for
GME is already enough to have fucked virgins 20 times and sacrificed them to
capitalist gods. 

Which means for hedgies with wedgies, its no longer a
tail-risk, blind-side event, its time to REAP the souls of every stimmy check
fool, by MaRkET MAkInG.

If I am that Hedgie, I write call options, while maintaining
a faade that I will rationally hedge those positions by buying more of the
underlying shares. FUN FACT: I already have them.

You stimmy check tards will keep buying into GME, because
you heard about it in the news over the weekend and want to get in on this
action to STICK IT TO THE MAN because 2020 has been an absolute suicidal
descent into madness because of COVID. You will probably go on for a couple
more days this upcoming week, now that liquidity restrictions are slowly being
lifted on trading platforms.

SO, while you fools supply buying volume, all I have to do
is collect my premiums on option sales, while slowly unwinding my underlying
share positions, and thereby also managing risk of option assignment since Ill
sell shares into every spike and swerve the price away from the strike price of
YOUR options.

And Ill also have an expectation as to where GME could
potentially rise to. You just look at the WSB subscriber count, multiply that
by the avg retail trader account liquidity.

You guys will think you have stuck it to the man, but the
man is sticking your wife ALREADY, ever since the moment you got angry and
emotional about an opportunity to unleash your pent up hatred towards the Wall
Street system. All I am saying is, for every tard like Melvin, theres 20 other
hedgies out there to fuck you up without you even realizing it. After all its
done, theyll even make you feel bad, saying you were Greedy and Reckless,
further perpetuating emotional volatility in markets that they will keep
profiting off of.

So while the retail GME HODLER thinks theres still enough
gold raining from the top of midtown Manhattan, all theyre getting is piss and
pre-cum.



**

APPENDIX  Ortex &amp; S3 Partners**

If you got all the way through until now, I apologize for my
lack of presentation in this thesis, its literally 3AM in the East Coast US
because Im up for 4AM pre-market (dont fucking judge me, Im a retard too).

So Ill explain that point from WAY up there about short
interest estimates.

I dont give a flying fuck what Ortex and S3 Partners says.
I do NOT believe that short float is STILL above %100 after the official data
came out on 1/27 with a lag of two fucking weeks from its settlement date on
1/15. The stock price moved so egregiously that every autist in Manhattan would
have literally gone bankrupt if theyre still short, NOT just Melvin.

See, heres the thing. If the system is ALREADY built with
this **two weeks lag** on short data for individual stocks, what fucking
data analytics company in their right mind would NOT try to take advantage of
this time &amp; information arbitrage? The system is FUCKED, but it gets
perpetuated because the ones perpetuating this have the MOST to gain.

Ortex and S3 Partners is purely a marketing ploy, they
hopped on this gravy train to get your subcriptions and some more clicky-clicks
on their website traffic so they can use those metrics to raise some more funds
later on.

And even if they believed in your cause, no smart data
analytics firm would willingly give up that information arbitrage to the
public, if they want to ever think about doing business with ANY hedge-fund in
town.

Therefore, I am sticking to my autistic thought that the
system is stacked (which most of you agree) against us. BUT, I urge you to be a
little bit more careful, because short float data can be misleading at best and
a total fraudulent bull-trap at worst. 

Again, If you are new here, welcome to the gang. This sub
will always be about losing money and becoming best friends with your wifes
boyfriend. But over time, it will be about the friends and knowledge you gained
along the way.

Thank you for listening to my ted-talk. I expect a PHD

Title: GME Original Analysis and Thesis for why I bought in at $13.
Evernote link for better formatting
https://www.evernote.com/shard/s406/sh/c770a0f8-21e9-75b5-9fa1-8afe83712c8a/b5c179b3717cccf990bd14b187d71dce

**Thesis:**  
With the advent of online gaming and e-sport, Gamestop is prime to make a turnaround and grow again assuming it will change direction and adapt post Covid. The support of Ryan Cohen, a e-commerce marketing guru, has brought hope to a once-beloved brand and ignited the flame of this reality.  The stock is also enticing because of its 138% short interest which is the highest percentage in the market. Thus, a remote chance of a short squeeze could occur. *Majority of investors do actually believe in the company and is not in it for  just the short squeeze opportunity. *    
&amp;nbsp;

--  
**Background:**  
Gamestop was once the most prolific gaming retailer in the brick and mortar time period. They made their profits by rebuying used games/gaming paraphernalia at low prices and marking them up greatly. They relied mainly on foot traffic due to a subpar online presence and they were slow to change. The low price and convenience of online shopping had won over shoppers causing the demise of brick and mortar. Large brands started disappearing left and right and now it was Gamestop's turn with a boost from Covid. Investors wrote GameStop off as a dinosaur company with its shares eventually dropping to $2.5 dollar.

--  
**Results:**   
Hedge funds saw this and decided to go short on them, betting on their demise like all the others. The funds abused the mechanism of the market to cause a large selling pressure onto the stock, forcing the stock price down and accelerating the demise. Could this be manipulation? If a hedge fund were to short a company out of spite, they could very possibly bankrupt a company.  

--  
**How did Gamestop survive for so long?**  
Even though they weren't raking in e-commerce profit, they were still profitable. It was just that that profit stream was shrinking. The profits were also concentrated at a fraction of their stores. As they closed unprofitable stores, they were able to offset cost slightly. Investors were also holding on to the imminent release of the new console super cycle. Investors noted that the golden days were right after the new consoles were released and Dec 2020 couldn't come quicker. Gamestop was patience and managed their financials well with a strong balance sheet. Investors had underpriced the real estate of theirs. They were not valued for growth anymore so they weren't in a situation to raise capital risk free. They have several billions in short-term and long-term debt but  they had 600 million cash in hand to cushion with. Lastly, the Nintendo switch had just came out and was the best selling gaming console ever. Gamestop rode the tailend of Nintendo success all through 2020 with Switch sales offsetting losses in the other gaming segments.  
https://www.evernote.com/shard/s406/res/8832d8fd-2fda-68ce-77ac-5ab3f362f936  

--  
**The turnaround:**  
A new management team had join in August 2019 that set to slim down the company. They were much more aggressive and sought to aggressively close stores. A comprehensive turnaround plan called GameStop ReBoot  was announced with 4 elements:   
  
1. Optimized the Core Business  
	Reducing unprofitable stores and focusing on what works  
2. Become the Social / Cultural Hub for Gaming  
	Turning Gamestop into a experience center and not just a store  
3. Build a Frictionless Digital Ecosystem  
	Revamp the supply chain to be e-commerce focused  
4. Transform Vendor Partnership  
	Rekindle and make new partnerships   
  
Like all new managements, this one needed time but unfortunately Covid complicated the plans. Investors became increasingly doubtful and even bearish. However, they had underestimated the future of gaming. 

--  
The first significant move was bringing Reginald Fils-Aim onto the board of directors. Reginald was known for his market prowess bring Nintendo to what it is today. Investors loved that. 

--  
As Covid happened, working from home and home entertainment exploded. Logitech, Corsair, Bestbuy exploded. Online gaming was projected to be very ludicrous in the next decade and Covid had shorten this timeline. Online gaming took off. Activision, Electronic Arts, Zynga, Tencent all exploded. Apple app revenue from their gaming segment exploded. Investors had repriced these stocks higher taking advantage of the first player advantage. One notable company that changed in valuation was Logitech, they were a value company but relabeled to growth. What was missing from this list was Gamestop. The bullishness in gaming was there and everyone else profited. If there was hope of a GME turnaround, their valuation model would certainly flip to a growth model at higher PE multiples. It was only fair.

The next big event that occurred  was in October 2020. Gamestop announced a partnership with Microsoft which was the first real tangible milestone on the turnaround plan. Investors started to give the company a second look.  Microsoft Partnership caused shares to rally 30% in a day. A bullish sign that the big players haven't given up. However this was short lived as shorts continue to drive the price down as there was no concrete details on the revenue sharing partnership, only that "for every Microsoft Xbox console that GameStop sells going forward, GameStop will get some percentage of the revenue from every digital full game download, DLC, microtransaction, and any subscriptions as well." To me this sounds very bullish that Microsoft still believes in Gamestop.  
 
--  
Next came news that the well-respected businessmen Ryan Cohen released that he had bought up 13% of Gamestop shares, becoming a minority owner. Ryan Cohen was the founder of Chewy, a Petsmart online branch that outcompeted Amazon. Investors labeled him an e-commerce guru/genius. He had bought shares at $4.81 and slowly gobbled up more as the price increased. Rumors started speculating that Cohen would takeover and transform Gamestop and it was materialized when Cohen sent the management a very aggressive letter.  

--  
"GameStops leadership should immediately conduct a strategic review of the business and share a credible plan for seizing the tremendous opportunities in the rapidly-growing gaming sector. GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences  not remain a video game retailer that overprioritizes its brick-and-mortar footprint and stumbles around the online ecosystem."  

--  
It was a do this or else there will be a hostile takeover. The letter was sent three weeks before Q3 Earnings and investors were now watching intensively for details of a roadmap or of a Cohen reference during the earning call. ER came around and management was mute beside the announcement of a shelf offering of 100mil. Company performance wise, they were negative on profit but had still beaten expectations. The expedited closure of unprofitable of the stores helped. The stock would have soared had not an offering been announce (offering dilutes shares) so instead GME dropped 17%. From the conference calls, many bull investors felt reluctantly weary of this turnaround while some even dismissed management consideration of Ryan and piled on to the shorts. A week later, a filing by Ryan Cohen showed that he had continued to believe that the stock was undervalued and bought even at $14.83. This news rekindled the speculation that Ryan Cohen was going to do a takeover. Stock bounced and soared to $22.35 dollars for the next few weeks before dropping to $17.35.    

--  
**Jan 2021 - The first squeeze:**  
Shorts were still convinced that Gamestop would not be turn around and so they held steady with a short interest above 130%. Some short sellers had left while new ones piled on.    

--  
Monday, Jan 11th, Gamestop decided to drop bombs to the short:  
- First with an announcement that there was 309% increase in e-commerce sales from 2019 holiday season, 4.8% increase in comparable store sales, 3.1% decrease in total sales.  
	- The biggest takeaway was that their new e-commerce strategy was working. 309% increase is massive. Also this followed their original plan to concentrate on their core. Rise in sales of profitable store was also shown. The closure unprofitable stores hit their total sales but it was not much and implied that these stores were dead weight. They slimmed their bleeding cost segment and increased their profit. This was super bullish.  
- Secondly, a board of advisor switch up was announced. Ryan Cohen and two main Chewy guys were hopping on, replacing 3 other people. 
	- Ryan essentially brought Chewy Management to Gamestop. They know have 1/3 of the company's vote.  
	- GME Management knew that a takeover was happening, hostile or not and so they opened the doors. They also expanded Ryan Cohen's ability to buy up to 20% of the total shares  
	- Permit And Hestia Capital also align more with his vision so that would put them at a 5/9 majority  
Result: Even with the news, the stock price stayed range bound at 20.5 and volume was extremely low for that Monday and Tuesday.  Shorts were once again depressing the price. However, Wednesday came and the first of the shorts closed their position while bulls bought calls. The stock soared. This catalyzed into a gamma squeeze to kick off the huge rally.  

--  
The analysis stopped dead of the gamma squeeze as these recent events have been a gray area of interpretation. Enjoy.

Title: My Theory for why the S3 data is wrong.
Disclaimer: I hold GME and I am retarded, so this is probably wrong, but it is definitely not financial advice.

Anyway, here what I think these sneaky fuckers did:

Lets say Melvbitch is short 100 shares. He needs to get 100 shares somehow to close this position to make it look like he got out of his short, but how does he get them? Calls. 

So, he buys a $0.5 1/29 call and exercises it (we will assume that SIG actually has the shares, so this doesnt trigger a gamma squeeze). But, he needs money to buy and exercise this bad boy, and where does he get that? Calls again. 

So, he sells 4-5 (based on what I am seeing value wise) OTM calls to get this money. This maintains his short position whilst making it appear that he is no longer short SHARES. He can also spread to the news that he closed a short position. 

If these OTM calls that he sold them expire OTM, he wins and gets out of the short basically. 

But no, thanks to the norse legend himself and all of you diamond handed autists, those bad boys expired ITM on Friday. Did Melvbitch have the shares for when these options got exercised, no. Did he get assigned them and is therefore still short despite making it appear that he is out? Yes. Now this fucker has to buy even more shares than he originally owed. 

Tldr: if I am correct, the S3 data is missing the options fuckery that they performed last week and they still have to buy hella shares. 

GME  

Edit: someone pls correct me if the S3 data would catch assigned shares.

Title: How High Can GME Go?
This is some retarded, third-grade level DD, some shit you could do as long as you know what a market cap and multiplication is.

We're in uncharted territory here and are witnessing a short squeeze which has never been seen before. We also don't have retrospect to show us what really happened as it all played out.

But we can look to the fabled Volkswagen short squeeze a while ago. I don't care about short interest or float or whatever: Volkswagen became the biggest company in the world at that time due to a short squeeze. If we consider market cap alone, how high can GME go?

Let's use 1 trillion as a nice round number. Sure there are companies with larger caps, but fuck I don't want to complicate things. GME (according to corrupt-as-fuck Robinhood) has a cap of 17 billion. Divide 1 trillion by this and we get the number 57. GME has to go up 57 times it's current price to be a trillion dollar company. 

330*57 is about $19,000 per share. If this squeeze played out like VW back in the day, we can look forward to at least this target. I could be wrong, I could be retarded, but this is what the math is pointing to if history somewhat repeats itself.

TL:DR: Buy and hold GameStop with  .

Disclaimer: I own 5 GME shares. I am long the stock. I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm retarded.. This is not financial advice. I'm drinking and fucked around with a calculator and considered it DD.

Title: $TSLA hates shorts DD
The short interest on **Tesla** is **56,367,815 shares**

Average **$TSLA** daily volume is 	**42,129,010 shares**

that is $47,348,964,600 (**$47 billion**) position and they will probably not ban it from trading

**Elon did it before** and burned the shorts.

Dozens of huge hedge funds bet against Elon Musk since 2013 and they **ALL LOST**.

The short position on **$TSLA** is much **MUCH** larger than all the meme stocks **COMBINED**. In $ amount.

**The future is electric**, GM announced all vehicles will be electric after 2035 others will follow.

 **Elon hates the shorts.**

There's **$50 billion** sitting there for us to take.

Title: GME Oddity and what it could mean
So I've been waiting to see someone talk about this. The TD ameritrade % held by institutions changed today...to 112.39%... which is an odd number because that would mean that there is 71-72 million share. However there are only 69.7M shares. Me being the autist I am, I checked for SEC filings which I couldn't find anything as of friday. Used a calculator (its that weird thing with number buttons) to count each institutions holdings and it checked out to the reported number. 

I'm not claiming that I'm smart, in fact I'm a dumbass who made most of his gains off of TLSA. However, and this is a big however, unless I am even dumber then I think I am, there can not be more than 100% of a companies shares. This means that EVEN THE INSTITUTIONS ARE HOLDING ARTIFICIAL SHARES. 

Again the if comes in, if I'm not a total dumbass, it means that just the institutions have the ability to diamond hand this bitch into infinity.  

So overall where does this leave the retards and autists and fomoers. Well, I don't fucking know. Some how this situation has to fix itself, if the government steps in we might get fucked. GME could step in and we get fucked. OR the free market resolves itself and we all go to uranus where there is a special tendie town built for gmetards.

I am not a financial advisor, nothing I say holds any weight, I'm just an idiot who noticed an oddity in some percentages.

Title: The DD on SLV - Updated 1/31 - clarity on what to buy
Edit: it appears someone may have created bots to downvote SLV posts because this got bombed immediately by downvotes.  Mods can you look into this? Either that or we really have become a monotheistic sub where only GME can be mentioned.

Hello silver surfers, clang gang, and monkeys who enjoy shiny things

Thank you for helping [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6novm/the_real_dd_on_slv_the_worlds_biggest_short/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) go viral and make it on Zerohedge (dreams fulfilled).

Before I get GME hate mail, let me clarify I am still long GME and am looking for the moon in GME.  I also have a small long silver position.  Both positions are quite small as I am unfortunately not super well capitalized.  Many of the comments about buys on the previous post referenced order sizes I can only dream of at the moment, but I'm damn glad we have so much conviction behind this trade.

I created an official [Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/Thehappyhawaii1/status/1355663208774836228?s=20). Not sure if Ill use it, but didnt want anyone to impersonate me.

Clang gang acted so fast, that all the bullion dealers sold out over the weekend which is incredible, and overnight futures are spiking as we speak.  I continue to support the purchase of physical silver as a way to continue the short squeeze if you can find any of course.  The short squeeze thesis is built upon tying up as much of the physical silver into our diamond hands as possible.  With that said, I thought I would add some clarity to my position on the various options out there to play the silver squeeze.

**It is organized into 2 sections:**

**1. the futures market (for big players)**

**2. alternatives (for smaller players**)

&amp;#x200B;

**1.**

**The futures market:** for the squeeze to really happen, we desperately need some of the bigger pocketed players who have access to the futures market to purchase silver contracts on the open market.  **If you can play in the futures market, it is imperative that you do so.**  I have been trying to find a retail broker who will allow customers to take physical delivery rather than force cash settlement but have had no luck so far.  If anyone knows of such a retail broker, please let me know so I can update the post with the info.  This is by far the most important piece of the short squeeze equation.

Let me explain:

When traders hold long futures contracts to expiration, they are making a statement that they want to take delivery.  Taking delivery does not mean the silver is transferred to your house, but rather it goes to the CME warehouse.  You can go pick it up from the warehouse or arrange transfer, or you can pay $8.50 a month per 1000 ounces to just store it at the warehouse (which is quite cheap at that scale).  The futures market allows players to use extreme amounts of margin and leverage, which is where the 'naked shorts' come from.  They are able to sell massive amounts of silver with very little collateral to back it up, and no actual silver on hand.  **This also explains why institutions such as citadel or others hold positions in the ETFs like SLV.** If you have more than 50,000 shares in SLV, you can request to have your share of the silver delivered to you.  They are hedging against their naked shorts in the futures market by trying to gain access to a source of silver should they need it.  The thing is, if the short squeeze occurs, even their holdings in SLV will not be enough to meet their obligations.

In order for the buyers to call their bluff they need to not use their margin power, as tempting as it may be to do so.  They need to only purchase as much silver in the futures market as they actually have money in their account to cover the final purchase (the price is locked in at the time of the futures contract purchase).  Then as expiration approaches, refuse to settle in cash, and pony up the money to actually buy the silver and have it delivered.  At that time the seller needs to find silver fast, and tries to purchase it from somewhere else to meet their contractual obligations.  The rush of all the naked shorts to try and find physical silver is what massively drives up the price and causes the short squeeze.

There may even be dips in the futures market if the buyers are planning to do the squeeze.  This is because they will not be using margin whiles the seller are.  The sellers may be able to push the price down temporarily, but when expiration comes they will find themselves in one hell of a bind when they find out all of the buyers actually have the cash in their accounts to take delivery and refuse to settle in cash.

As the supply of silver dries up and literally there is no way to fulfill the obligations of the long contract holders, the silver futures market will actually be effectively shut down.  The CME will force settle all remaining contracts for cash at the current market rate (which will have spiked dramatically).  This is the last thing the CME wants to do, and will only do it as a final last resort.  If this occurs we can declare victory at having exposed the silver futures market for the fraud that it is.  A futures market is built on the trust that the sellers can actually deliver the product they are selling, and if they can't then that trust is destroyed.  If you go long and they don't have the silver to give you, you will still be paid the money for that amount of silver at the going rate.

Following this collapse the futures market will relaunch at a 1-1 margin requirement.  This means that for every silver ounce sold, the seller will actually have to have the silver or at least the collateral to cover that exact amount of silver on the open market.  The futures market will have moved from 250-1 paper to physical, to 1-1.  The massive banks who were naked short will have lost tens or maybe even hundreds of billions of dollars collectively.  In my previous post I implied it was likely JP Morgan naked shorting.  They have a history of doing so and being fined for manipulation, but we don't actually know which big players are the current naked shorts and who might even be net long.

**2.**

**This is where the rest of us come in...** if you can't play the futures market, you can still purchase and tie up physical silver where the naked shorts can't access it.  Thus setting up the environment for the squeeze to occur.  Whether its WSB players or some other big fund who sees what is happening and does the futures part themselves, they will only be able to do so because of the smaller purchases of silver by millions of smaller players.

**Physical silver:** by purchasing physical silver you are taking silver off the market that the shorts will need when the squeeze occurs.  You aren't directly causing the short squeeze, you are helping to set up the environment for the squeeze to occur, and you will have the silver to sell after the squeeze happens.

**Silver ETFs (SLV, PSLV, SIVR):** this is the same concept as the physical silver.  By purchasing silver ETFs you are locking up physical into the ETF's vaults, which wont be able to be able to be purchased by the shorts in the futures market because they belong to the ETF shareholders.  There has been a ton of chatter about whether ETFs should be used at all, and of the ETFs which is the best or most reliable.  Frankly if you have doubts about the ETFs, just don't use them.  All of the physical silver is already sold out so this is the easiest way for most people to play at this point.  If you prefer physical but its sold out or selling for ridiculous premiums, just buy the ETFs until the premiums come down and then sell the ETF to purchase more physical. It is possible that at some point SLV (or other ETFs) will no longer create new shares as silver becomes impossible to find (thus they cant create a new share because they can't the silver to back it up).   At that point the ETFs will likely trade at a hefty premium to NAV and it may no longer make sense to purchase them.  But that hasn't occurred yet so I'd say it still certainly makes sense to buy these ETFs.  We have no proof that they are lying about their silver holdings, and if they disallow new share creation, I'd say that means they really aren't lying about their holdings, otherwise they would happily take as much investment as we would give them to collect management fees.

**Call options on Silver ETFs:** Calls will have a similar effect to purchasing the ETFs as the market maker will have to purchase the underlying ETF to be hedged.  It has a levered effect that can both hurt and help the squeeze depending on which direction the silver price is headed.

**Miners:** miners will benefit from the squeeze but buying them doesn't help the squeeze occur in any direct way.  People buying miners will benefit if we are successful, but the more capital that flows into them rather than the alternatives, it will lower the chances of the squeeze being successful in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:**

**if monke have lot of money, long futures with no margin and take delivery.**

**If monke not have lot of money, buy physical silver bullion and silver ETFs**

Hopefully this answered some of the questions that flooded my inbox from the previous post.  Good luck to all.  GME and SLV to moon.  Lets squeeze the naked shorts, expose the manipulation, and take our tendies from the hedge funds.

Disclaimer: everyone is an individual who can make their own decisions, I'm not a financial advisor, you can lose all your money betting on these plays, etc, etc, bullshit, the SEC is spineless unless they arrest those involved in the 1/27 GME manipulation and pay all of us damages

Title: Just buy the stock or Sell your ITM GME calls before they expire
The gamma squeeze pushed the price up a bit last week as a result of MMs buying GME shares to sell to you when your ITM call gets exercised. This just occurred to me that many of you may have had GME calls expire ITM and you now hold 100, 200, 300 etc. shares and have a margin call on your account.

Your broker will sell those shares for you swiftly and that is perfectly legal. This could cause GME to fall quite a bit since the gamma squeeze was the result of MMs having to buy those shares you now own and are being forced to sell.

Lastly, if the price does drop tomorrow because of this very possible and real scenario, DO NOT SELL -  or GTFO.

Edit: Not a financial advisor. I'm an idiot.

Title: Alright heres a sports analogy for you apes that might like sports but are still struggling to understand whats happening with $GME.
This might get deleted. I know this sub is getting absolutely bombarded with random hot takes and DDs, but Im hoping this might be an analogy that helps a lot of people understand GME and the squeeze thats happening, and will be unique enough to stay. 


If youre still struggling to understand the squeeze, shorting and the $GME trends, Im here to help. Bear with me. (No, not that bear). 

This is gonna be really oversimplified, but be different than  and .

So, imagine a college star, up and coming high draft pick. Most sports are apt for this analogy, but NFL works best. 


This is a QB projected #1 pre-season. Hes legit. bona-fide, undeniable talent. Lets call him Game Stop, (Stop, #69). 

Hes on a shit team and gets dealt a shit hand for 2020 (bad team + pandemic. Limits games played, falling off the radar). 

Now lets a few things happen: 

1.) Someone makes a massive bet that Game Stop is washed, terrible and will never recover, but they have to borrow money to make that bet. They hate the player because theyre old and resentful and afraid of death, and they want to do everything they can to prevent this young player from succeeding. They want to force them to fail by making everyone else believe they will fail. 

2.) A new head coach gets hired, someone who is absolutely qualified and primed to bring out the absolute best in Game Stop, and revolutionize and evolve their game. 

3.) A random dude on the internet notices how high the bet is against the player, Game Stop. They think to themselves, Hey, Ive seen that dude play. His talent is undeniable, and hes got the perfect new coach. There is no WAY hes gonna be that bad. 

4.) This dude lets his buddies know about how high the bet against the player, Game Stop, is, and they agree. There is no WAY theyre that bad, especially with the new coach! Theres no way this bet can win, this is easy money!

5.) Word about the bet spreads like wildfire. Not only do more and more people do their research and watch game tape and realize how talented the player is, they realize how insane the bet against him is. 

Now, Game Stop (#69) starts to get back on track. They start playing games again and show their potential, their talent. Theyre making a playoff run. Now theyre gaining more and more attention, and MORE people realize theyre gonna succeed. 

The original person who bet against the player, who was convinced they were washed, starts to panic. The person they borrowed the money from is starting to see whats going on, and starts to ask for the money back. Every game that Game Stop plays, they prove themselves more and more, and the bet against them gets even more spicy. At this point, the bettor borrows even more money and DOUBLES DOWN, stubborn and convinced the player will fail and prove they were right. 

People arent having it. Theyve SEEN the games, they KNOW the talent, there is absolutely no way this player isnt legit, no possible way for them to fail. They bet even more in support. They KNOW hell succeed, make the playoffs and win the championship and be the #1 pick. 

At this point, the person who bet against him is losing an insane amount of money. There is no way they can pay back the original bet. Theyll be absolutely ruined and embarrassed. Somehow, they have enough power to stop the player from playing games. They take the games off TV, they  delete the highlight videos, they go to the news screaming This player is terrible. Trash, washed. Anyone who doesnt believe that is delusional, wrong, and will lose a lot of money. 
It doesnt matter, everyone has already seen the games, the highlights, the talent, with their OWN EYES. Its undeniable. The bet is terrible, and the new coach fits perfectly. 

Every single day the bettor doesnt cut his losses, the person he borrowed from adds interest to the total they owe. Theyre getting impatient and they see the writing on the wall. BUT, if they wanna continue, thats fine, the bettor will just have to pay even more money at the end.


Thats where were at now. Exactly that. 

All it comes down to now, is all of us believing what weve already known, what weve already seen. They can take down the videos, they can blackout the media, they can keep them from even playing a game, but its too late. WEVE SEEN IT. WE KNOW. WE KNOW THE TALENT, THE COACH, AND HOW BAD THE BET IS. 

All we have to do is believe in ourselves, and trust in the talent weve seen, and stick to our guns about how terrible the bet against the player was. Every moment that goes by, every game they play, the bet gets worse, and our position gets better. 

No matter what, the original better has to call it quits and take their losses, but they will do EVERYTHING they can to make us stumble, falter, fear. To make us doubt ourselves and what weve seen, what we know. They cant. 


We watched this player in elementary school, in middle school, in high school, and college. They brought us countless moments of joy, and sometimes of sadness. We lost with them, but more importantly, we WON with them. How fucking DARE someone bet against them and their talent, and intentionally try to ruin their career, just out of spite, to make a profit. 

We know this player, we trust this player, we like this player, we believe in this player, and if we hold this player, by fucking God this player and everyone who believed in them, will win. Well succeed. 

And that son of a bitch who tried to ruin them? They lose everything. 



Title: DDDD - Why GME Might  Next Week, and How It Could Trigger a Financial Crisis
In today's edition of DDDD (Data-Driven DD), well be going over over the details about what happened this week with GME, the drama around Robinhood and other brokers, and take a close look at some data to determine whether or not GME and other various meme / high SI stocks such as AMC, BBBY, FIZZ, LGND, and ~~BB~~ will continue in its short squeeze this week, and how this all could lead to widespread stock market crash and financial crisis. But first, something to cover my ass for the SEC investigators combing through this Subreddit

Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.

## What Exactly Happened at Robinhood This Week?

There has been plenty of speculation this week about what exactly went down and unverified (although reasonable) rumors on why Robinhood did this. Ill go over the top two theories before taking a deep dive into the official reason given by Robinhood.

[**Pressure from the White House and Sequoia according to a Robinhood employee**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/l723kf/robinhood_insider_information/)

This statement has been [refuted by Sequoia](https://www.newsweek.com/sequoia-capitol-denies-pressuring-robinhood-stop-gamestop-trading-after-viral-reddit-post-1565269). I personally wouldnt believe the Sequoia part since I dont really know what they would gain from it - theyre a Venture Capital firm, not a hedge fund, and would not be actively shorting stocks let alone be trading in stocks. It could be possible that the White House, or someone from the government did contact Robinhood - actually, Id be pretty shocked if no one called them at some point this week to ask wtf was going on.During this call, they may have been afraid that GameStops short squeeze would have triggered a major financial crisis due to hedge funds collapsing and de-grossing, causing a mass selloff similar to what was seen in 2008 and in March 2020 - Ill talk more about this later. Basically, without Robinhood shutting down GME from being bought, its actually very possible we would have seen the rest of the stock market collapse last week, and this was something the Biden administration was trying to make sure didnt happen in the first month in office.

**Possible intervention from Citadel Securities**

This was a theory I personally believed in initially and would have been a very obvious area of scrutiny for many people. The most straightforward one being the fact that Citadel (the hedge fund) dumped a few billion into Melvin to bail it out a [few days ago](https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340), who were the very well known shorts of GME. Citadel, the hedge fund, is owned by Citadel LLC, which happens to also run Citadel Securities - a market maker. If you dont know what this is, go grow a few brain wrinkles and read my [previous post about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5ygab/dddd_how_rwallstreetbets_created_a_financial/). Citadel Securities is effectively Robinhoods sugar daddy, directly being responsible for around [40% of their revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/18/a-controversial-part-of-robinhoods-business-tripled-in-sales-thanks-to-high-frequency-trading-firms.html) in 2018 through their payment for order flow (i.e. selling your trades to Citadel, giving them the right of first refusal, and [potentially giving you a worse price](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321); this is how they get 0% commission trades btw).

Theoretically, Citadel the hedge fund and Citadel the market maker is run independently and sister companies both owned by Citadel LLC, but anyone can see this being a potential conflict of interest. Theres also a possibility that Citadel Securities losing billions of dollars being short so many GME calls (they write 99% of all options contracts) and probably not being perfectly Gamma and (especially) Vega hedged, so when those two greeks skyrocketed on GME they probably lost tons of money there. [According to WSB hero Chamath](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354947541125611526), he didnt invest in Robinhood when they came to him on multiple occasions because he thought the founders lacked integrity, implying he believes they might have been the type of people to sell out their users (granted, they already literally do this) and do this type of shit.

**The Official Reason - Clearing House Limitations**

Lets get to the [official reason put out by Robinhood](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility), which is that their clearing house, in this case the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp, suddenly increased their collateral requirements on GME trades drastically. Apparently, **Robinhood is running out of cash**, so they werent able to provide the cash collateral demanded by DTCC, and hence werent able to trade through them. Lets dumb this down and talk about how brokerages work.

Lets talk about what a clearing house is and how they work. Imagine Bob wants to sell Dylan a share of GME. Theres a bunch of legal paperwork and logistics for actually transferring over the share, which can take a few days to finalize - this is called settlement. However, you dont want people being able to back out of this exchange during this process for obvious reasons, so thats where the clearing house comes in. Lets call this clearing house Mary. What Mary does is facilitate (clear) this exchange, and ensures both Bob and Dylan follow through with their trade by having them both immediately give Mary cash as collateral while the exchange settles. If one party was no longer able to meet their end of the exchange (eg. Dylan goes bankrupt), Mary acts as an insurer and is responsible for buying the share from Bob instead. If it turned out that Bob was lying about actually owning a share and can't transfer it over to Dylan in time (failure to deliver), Mary is responsible for finding that share for him instead.

Since GME suddenly became very volatile, and the financial soundness of some parties and their ability to deliver their side of the trade have been suddenly called into question ([at least on the sellers side](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)), DTCC decided  (...or due to pressure from other sources?) to increase the collateral needed for buying GME to be more than 10x of the proportion of the market value of whatever it was before. Most brokerages reacted to this by disabling margin trading. For some reason, Robinhood went one step further and disabled trading for all accounts, possibly due to their relatively small cash reserves compared to places like Fidelity, and the relatively large number of users who use margin in the platform.

## Whats Robinhood Going To Do About GME?

Robinhoods decision to stop purchases of GME basically got hate from literally everyone, to the point where it somehow united the country in a beautiful way. Heres a list of things that happened as a result of Robinhoods decision, for fun

* [Ted Cruz retweeted AOC saying he completely agreed with her](https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1354833603943931905)
* [Protests at NYSE and Robinhood HQ](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/protesters-gather-at-robinhood-hq-nyse-in-response-to-restricted-stock-trades)
* [Class action lawsuit](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/28/investing/lawsuit-robinhood-gamestop-wallstreetbets/index.html)
* [Someone paid to have an airplane](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rlyx/this_guy_is_flying_a_banner_saying_suck_my_nuts/) fly around the Bay Area over Robinhoods office saying Suck my nuts Robinhood
* [Angry Robinhood employees were given DoorDash credits for some reason?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7y5ka/robinhood_staff_unhappy_about_the_trading_hault/)
* [Congressional investigation to Robinhoods decision](https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-job-posting-federal-affairs-congress-hearing-gamestop-reddit-2021-1)
* [SEC investigation to Robinhoods decision](https://www.cnet.com/news/robinhood-troubles-sec-will-closely-review-actions-that-restricted-amc-gamestop-stock-trades/)

Clearly, this decision has single-handedly made Robinhood the most hated company in the world right now. Its especially bad given the optics - their mission is to literally democratize finance, with the idea of empowering individual retail investors to be on the same level of institutions. This decision, whether intentional or not, has literally gone against everything about Robinhoods image and mission, and will end the company if not fixed soon. **All of this right as Robinhood is planning to launch their IPO**.

The people in charge of Robinhood likely know all of this and are doing everything they can to find cash and liquidity to put up the collateral needed to resume GME trading. So far weve seen them raise $1B from investors and $500M through lines of credit overnight, although based on the fact that GME is still restricted, that doesnt seem to be enough. However, in my personal opinion, I think it's likely that Robinhood is doing everything they can to find more money given the situation, and once they do, **they will likely re-enable trading on GME. If that happens (which IMO will probably be some time next week), GME and all other high-SI stocks will absolutely** \*\*.\*\*

## How GME Almost Caused (and Still Can Cause) a Stock Market Crash

Lets go over something else interesting that went on as a result of the GME short squeeze - the fact that it started to affect the stock market overall. In fact, the stock market had the largest decline since October across all sectors on Wednesday when GME, AMC, and other high-SI stocks surged, with a very sharp recovery as the meme stocks fell after Robinhood suspending purchases; this was one of the biggest de-grossing of hedge funds in history. [Chamath wrote a great Twitter thread about this](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354883147523997697), so amazing that Ill just copy-paste his tweets rather than try to explain it better myself.

&gt;*A children's book explanation of what's happening:*  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. If you are "smart money" you are allowed to take your $1 and leverage it up to $15+*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. You can now buy $15 of stock AND if you promise to short companies, you can short $15 of stock as well*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. In finance language, this means that you are $30 "gross" ($15 of longs + $15 of shorts) but $0 net (+$15 of longs -$15 of shorts). This makes everyone feel good because it feels like you are taking zero risk...but in reality, your $1 is exposed to $30 of risk.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Now you go around and tell your friends about both your longs and your shorts and when you do it at a restaurant vs on Reddit, its called an "ideas dinner".*  
&gt;  
&gt;*5. You also publish your longs on a quarterly lag via an SEC rule.  You don't have to tell anyone about your shorts.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*6. Now the less cool people who weren't invited to the ideas dinners, start copying your longs based on your report.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*7. You realize that publicizing your shorts is also a good idea so instead of only selling stocks, you also BUY options (puts) which has to be reported.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*8. Now everyone can see both your longs and your shorts and if you have a hot hand, you can likely predict that the cool people from the dinner as well as the less cool people monitoring your filings will copy you.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*9. But then an outsider notices that the math is way off!*  
&gt;  
&gt;*10. Apparently, some of these shorts that you own represent more than 100% of the entire stock of the company. Huh?*  
&gt;  
&gt;*11. So he grabs his chicken fingers and champagne and buys, starts a massive short squeeze. 12. Other's see what's happening and they jump in.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*13. Now a massive short squeeze starts.  You have to cover your shorts ASAP. But the banks also notice that you don't have enough credit to cover the $30 they lent you and ask for more collateral. You now also have to sell your long positions.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*14. What happens next is that a cascade of short covering and long selling starts driving some stocks to the moon and others way down.  Which stocks went up? Basically the ones that were the most heavily shorted by you and your buddies in the first place.*

[Hedge fund grossing \/ de-grossing](https://preview.redd.it/c5we1d7e0se61.png?width=761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a11131168d69e5f3aea93c8fd087a1478500ddc)

In other words, as stocks like GME go up, the highly-leveraged hedge funds that are shorting these stocks are forced to sell their longs as they cover their shorts. Most retail investors are limited to 2x leverage, but since hedge funds are hedged by taking short and long positions, they can be up to 30x levered since theoretically they would be shielded from external events that cause all stocks to go up or down in price (i.e. Beta neutral), so theyre safer. To get out of these short positions, they will need to massively unwind their long positions as well so they can still have a reasonable Net Exposure, triggering a sell-off in those stocks.

A very similar thing actually happened in March (with risk-parity) causing hedge funds to similarly massively de-gross, and literally everything from GLD to even AMZNs stock price dropping as a result, even though theoretically COVID-19 wouldve been good for both from a fundamental basis, as we saw later on. Its very likely that if Robinhood hadnt stopped purchases of GME, many more hedge funds shorts would have had their shorts blow up and be forced to continue to de-gross causing a widespread stock market crash, potentially being the catalyst for finally popping the [decade-long liquidity (leverage)-fueled asset bubble weve been experiencing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcfn5/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble/) In fact, this could still happen since it doesnt look like hedge funds have learned their lesson and **are still heavily short GME with Net Shares Shorts barely moving this week** [**according to S3 Partners**](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1355225495835709441)**.** Furthermore, despite seeing the largest de-grossing of hedge funds since 2009, **gross exposure (aka leverage) of hedge funds still remains** [**close to record-high levels**](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-hedgefunds/goldman-sees-hedge-fund-exposures-close-to-records-ongoing-sell-off-risk-after-gamestop-swings-idUSL1N2K60GW).

**TLDR**

In case your attention span was too short to read everything above,

1. Robinhood is going to be doing everything they can to raise cash to resume GME purchases, when this happen GME 
2. Much of the stock markets value is held by over-leveraged hedge funds, so **if GME (and other common shorts)  the rest of the stock market might collapse around it (EDIT - as hedge funds re-consider their long / short strategy), triggering a financial crisis**

*Now, just to be clear, buying GME right now is joining a game of hot potato; the longer you hold the potato the more tendies you get to eat for dinner, but at some point this will all blow up and when it does someone will be the bagholder - and right now everyone is rooting for these bagholders to be the hedge funds that are short GME. That being said, with Short Interest barely moving this week, this day of reckoning doesnt look like itll be coming in the next few days and for reasons mentioned above, its probably more likely for GME to reach $1K next week than the probability that itll fall below $100.*

Or in other words, [I like these stocks](https://www.highshortinterest.com/).

EDIT - Appearently S3 Partners just contradicted [their tweet on Friday](https://s3partners.com/Exclusive.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=announcement&amp;utm_campaign=10ds) and now indicate that shares short of GME have dipped below 30M shares. Still highly shorted compared to most other stocks, fwiw.

EDIT2 - Getting alot of questions on how one short position in a small cap can do this, and my answer is that GME alone wouldn't cause a financial crisis, but rather what GME represents, which is disproving that hedge funds that a long / short strategy (i.e. taking out additional leverage to short similar companies they long) is unviable; The word from my hedge fund friends is that this type of thing would have been considered a six-sigma event, or one in a billion chance of happening; which is obviously no longer true. Hedge funds seeing Melvin go down will probably start re-consider their short books. This on mass will cause a mass short-covering and also sell-off of their longs. Hedge funds levering up using cheap money has been the basis of the stock market's rise the past year - how do you think money magically goes from Powell's money printer to the stock market?

**ADM and Future for Sustainable Agriculture and Cost Reduction**

Ok, supposedly everyone cares about sustainable business models and the environment nowadays. Which they should. But sometimes it is a little more complicated than just buying an electric vehicle. Food production is a massive contributor to global CO2 emissions. See: [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507104446.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507104446.htm) (TLDR: Soybean trade is bad for the environment.)

Soybean and Corn is currently processed for animal feed. But guess what, you can create animal feed with minimal land, space and water. How? The answer is insect protein.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sy5wfcme0se61.png?width=693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9c103918acf66501dab0840737a52e3a4381308

Insect Protein Animal Feed Industry

Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and InnovaFeed plan to begin building what will be the worlds largest insect protein facility in 2021 in the city of Decatur in central Illinois.

PROS:

\- Black soldier fly larvae eat non-compostable food waste bound for landfills + produce hundreds of times more protein per acre than traditional animal feed sources. This will be attractive to the public with the growing consciousness of environmental sustainability.

\- Current animal feed is sourced from soybean meal and corn meal. The massive quantities of corn and soybean farming requires large amounts of land and water. Insects can be grown indoors, requiring far less land and water.

\- **Not only does the farming of insects decrease CO2 emissions in itself, these insects eat and feed on WASTE. This food processing decreases CO2 emissions AND reduces landfill waste.**

CONS:

\- Insect food processing is still not cost competitive with traditional animal feed; however, innovation and sustainability always comes with a cost.

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottcarpenter/2021/12/31/worlds-largest-insect-protein-farm-signals-future-of-food-supply/?sh=4309e14606a9](https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottcarpenter/2021/12/31/worlds-largest-insect-protein-farm-signals-future-of-food-supply/?sh=4309e14606a9)

# TLDR

\- ADM is currently holding 10% less market cap while trading at a lower P/E and P/S. (Compared to CTVA, it's biggest competitor.)

\- ADM provides 2x the annual dividend (Compared to CTVA, its biggest competitor.) AKA BOOMERS LIKE DIS STOCK TOO.

\- ADM shows consistent (although slow) year over year growth. Current financials do not project ADM to be a growth stock. I believe this what causes it to trade at such a low price to earnings ratio (50% lower than market average); however, I believe their initiative for a more sustainable business model will change this in the long term.

\- Insect farming reduces required land and water. You can literally raise these in a small indoor facility anywhere in the world...or even the moon   . Insect farming has potential to be much cheaper than current business models. Insect farming reduces CO2 emissions and they feed for landfill waste. You can grow feed for livestock while reducing the amount of landfill waste AND reducing CO2 emissions.

Positions: I am only holding shares at the moment. As we are seeing a current market pull back, I will most likely enter LEAPS 1/20/2023 $55C. This allows time for the insect protein segment to develop. Who knows, maybe they can even get government tax incentives for this sustainable initiative.  

Sorry this isnt GME. Remember you can hold more than 1 stock at once, unless youre poor.

Title: GameStop DD May have 300 Million Total Shares- Be Careful
[deleted]

Title: Unpopular $GME DD
Before I start, let me just say that I am all about the $GME train and hope it is a 1-way trip to Uranus for all those holding with diamond hands. I have been around WSB for years under this username and my other, less anonymous one. Check my other posts to confirm I am not hedgie agent scum.

Now, to the unpopular part: a word of caution. I see a lot of DD around here analyzing the short interest, the $GME public float, and theories about what that means for the trading price of the stock. Yes, we like the stock. HOWEVER, all of this DD fails to consider one very important variable  the authorized but unissued shares of $GME.

If you look at $GMEs articles of incorporation (this is the document that gives a company its corporate existence and, among other things, states the number of shares the company is authorized to issue), you will see that $GME is authorized to issue up to 300,000,000 shares. Currently it looks like there are about 70,000,000 shares outstanding depending on whose number you go with. So, theoretically, the board of directors of $GME could issue three times the number of shares that are currently outstanding today.

Is the board going to do that? Your guess is as good as mine. On one hand, the board is certainly not going to go out of their way to help out a bunch of hedge funds that were trying to total screw them over and drive them into the ground. But on the other hand, the board has a fiduciary obligation to act in the best interests of the shareholders of the company. If they can raise a bunch of money selling stock at a $300+ price level, they have to legally consider it. This could significantly improve their balance sheet by allowing them to take out debt with the cash proceeds from a very rich equity sale.

So, could they easily issue more shares? The answer is yes. In December, the company filed an automatic shelf registration statement. This allows them to, essentially at any time and very quickly register a follow-on public equity sale. You can bet your ass that these shorts have been making calls into the company to see what the appetite would be in taking this route, which could allow them to get out of their positions for substantially less than would be the case if they had to cover in the secondary market (because, diamond hands, of course).

Now a couple of good things, even if the board wanted to do this, it seems very risky for all concerned. I think we all know that after the squeeze is done, hitting whatever price it is going to hit ($1,000, $10,000, $42,069???), eventually the price is going to come back to land (could be a week, a month, a year, who knows). When that happens, selling stock at a hugely inflated value based on earning performance (note that I have argued the price today of $GME is totally supported for economic reasons) is going to invite lawsuits galore, so perhaps the board (Which is risk averse by nature) doesnt want to make a move without letting things settle out. Time will tell. Also, all of this free press has to be a boon for business and I have to believe that the board sees what happened with Robinhood (aka Robbin Gainz) where they totally disenfranchised their whole user base in a single day and saw the valuable lesson there. Thus, this is another reason that the $GME board probably wont issue more shares to screw over the WSB investors, many of whom are their target market.

All that said, I want to see the $GME rocket broaching interstellar space like the rest of you MONKEs.

Also, need to give some love to the rest of the $BANG stocks, $BB, $AMC, and $NOK. 

Lets hope the $GME board also has diamond hands and lets this ship fly!!!!!


Edit 1: Tl;dr I predict , but there is a risk that the company refuels our ship prematurely.

Edit 2: I will qualify my comments by acknowledging the fact that the NYSE does have a 20% Rule which generally requires shareholder approval for a NYSE-listed company from issuing more than 20% of its outstanding, so that is a real constrain as well. There are some exceptions to this, but no one wants to read more about this.

Title: Life AFTER GME - Back to doing some DD!
Good evening OG and newbie autists,

**TLDR = HOLD GME for as long as you can this DD is for AFTER the squeeze, once out get your money into PUTS.**

I wanted to bring you some DD that I have been working on but first let me get something out of the way.  I am tired of all the stock talk and we need to get back to some old school DD so we know where to YOLO our GME returns AND talk about options again.  I do not recommend getting out GME for any reason for the below.  This is what I think is occurring now and over the next few months, or faster, pending the severity of the situation.  If the situation is as severe as u/johnnydaggers &amp; u/vinlo make it look then this could happen A LOT faster.

GME TO THE MOON 

The unfortunate part is I am a bull by nature, always have been.  This write-up is extremely bearish in nature but before calling me a it is only because of the unique situation us glorious folk has put us in with uncovering a massive issue with the market.

What is going on now is starting to look a lot like 2008/09.  I believe that the HF's got caught so bad with their naked short selling that there is literally no way to unwind the damage that they are doing.  For some reference PLEASE read this post as I believe this is the catalyst to what I am posting below.  I was missing a piece but tonight I believe I found it:

[u/johnnydaggers &amp; u/vinlo naked short selling write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9jbc5/listen_to_me_we_cannot_trust_the_short_interest/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

I started looking at the 08/09 housing crash and then it hit me that the VW squeeze was also occurring around this time.  So what I wanted to see was how much liquidity came out of the market between the squeeze and the housing crisis.  **Can you believe the VW squeeze dropped the market more than the housing crisis?**  The below SPY chart goes from 7/1/2008 to somewhere mid-April.

* You can see that just after the squeeze started the entire market started to dump.  This most likely had to with liquidity and all the same issues we are seeing now
* The VW squeeze dropped the SPY 37% in about 6 weeks
* There was then a 26% rebound during the **peak** of the short squeeze - This tells me the people that were screwed in this one were consolidating liquidity and once they had an idea of what was going on moved into buying calls prior to shorting the market and exacerbating the housing collapse.
* The entire market was still trending down after this rebound until the lowest of lows of the housing market crash

Here is what piqued my interest.  The VW squeeze dropped the SPY **37%** from beginning to end, and the entire housing crisis dropped SPY **28%**?  **HOW IS THIS EVEN REMOTELY POSSIBLE?**

[I eat chalk, not crayons, they taste better.](https://preview.redd.it/4gzqdeml6re61.png?width=1478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf799e7b86ec26b0b6afcefdf241cb1b48131306)

So I take this info and now look at the current SPY chart and see what GME is doing to the overall market.  This is where we are now:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ppqn65f48re61.png?width=706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3db07d8189af90cc0d6c56cdc5c373820d5f9ea

If we apply some basic math the correct on the market could be somewhere in the 240s.  Yes, I know how crazy that sounds but I believe this to be the beginning of the bubble popping.  We exposed a HUGE crack in the foundation and I think it is only going to get worse especially if any of the additional data provided above is accurate.  If it is then we could be looking at a correction closer to the 45% overall range in the next 6-9 months.

My plays:

GME TO THE MOON - Mix of options and shares and riding this into VALHALLA

As for the bullshit above I am going to be going with:

315P (4-6 Weeks out)

200/250p range or both EOY

I am not a financial advisor, I don't know anything about anything.  I like stonks like GME and this is my very biased mostly retarded fully autistic opinion.



Edit 1 - I really appreciate the awards but put that money to better use!  GME  for now!

Edit 2 - I do not believe this most recent update from S3. Few reasons where did they get new numbers 6h later on a Sunday? Two - How the fuck do you cover 30M shares on a 50M volume?

Dear retards, Ihor Dusaniwsky is saying that the shares shorted are below 30M, which would mean that the SI is around 50%. The data is not yet final and their algorithm is still calculating.

What does this mean? I have sent a twitt to Ihor as soon as he posted that info asking whether he likes my . This has worked in the past. He has not liked them yet, but I will edit if it happens.

Positions:

I don't fucking care, I am gonna fuck them so much anyway, but let's pick doggy

But also 435 shares from $37 to $40 more or less

&amp;#x200B;

This is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor but only a retarded stock warrior.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: many likes, but not Ihor's. He just posted this:

EDIT2: Ihor is usually up for discussion and replies a lot of twitts. This time, it was only one reply - the one I posted on the first edit. He has gone silent. Either they fucked up before, or they fucked up now. Either way, this stinks.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT3: As our fellow retard /u/Asynchronization points out:

&gt;But to be honest maybe he left us with a clue, its clear that this is not what he was trying to communicate. But there are so many red flags and inconsistencies and he contradicted himself earlier in the day and also he couldve presented the data in a way that would have been much more subtle and convincing/believable to make us doubt. He wrote his messages like there was a gun to his head.  
&gt;  
&gt;Do you think you could add this angle in your post? Its clear what were seeing isnt the truth. Melvin is desperate because he knows if we have this data, it could be the nail in the coffin come monday. You go for the kill when you know your prey cant fight back the next time you strike.z

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT4: Although he didn't reply any further, maybe he's giving us a hint. Look at the twitts he's liked: https://mobile.twitter.com/ihors3/likes

Title: IF Vlad at RH is telling the truth, it would have only taken $7.5B to keep the game going last week. The complicity runs deep in this one.
First of all, I own one share of GME and am holding until the entire system melts down or $100,000/share. I trade on RH, so that's all I could buy on Friday. Now strap in.

*Mods: For the love of God, let this through. My account is 4 years old, I have 10K karma, and I've been posting/active on WSB for close to a year now.*

I'm going to make this short and sweet. If the brokers are telling the truth, and the lockdown in trading was due to collateral requirements, then according to this article....

**ALL WE NEEDED TO KEEP TRADING WAS AN INFUSION OF $7.5B!!!!!!!**

But, u/clash_jeremy, that's so much money! NO IT ISN'T. The US Government ran a deficit of **$3.1T** last year to keep the whole system going. The Fed added close to **$3T** to their asset sheets to keep the whole system going. So, when it came time to keep the system going for the retail investor, **THEY LOOKED THE OTHER WAY!!!!!**

One of the main duties of the Fed and Treasury is to ensure liquidity in all markets. THAT'S LITERALLY WHAT WE NEEDED WEDNESDAY-FRIDAY of last week.

But, what if they didn't know this was coming. Yeah, convenient alibi if the CEO for DTCC wasn't literally an advisor for the Federal Reserve and the FDIC!

 If anyone knew the nonsense that was going to go down, it was this dude, and he has every obligation to alert the powers that be that there needs to be some sort of intervention to keep the game going. Nobody did anything, because if they allowed us to keep playing the game as normal last week, the hedgies would have been entirely obliterated.

The complicity runs deep in the shafting that occurred last week. Never forget!

Title: Some DD on $BB
Chamath told the world there's real research on Reddit. Here's real research on Reddit.

This report will discuss the current and future state of Blackberry Ltd (**Blackberry**) and its business viability. Too long has the cycle of research been held in the hands of big banks that are incentivized to publish aggressive price targets at the point of a transaction. Too long have buy-side institutions been caged inside an investment parameter that is geared towards accumulating capital than growing it.

We will be discussing Blackberrys product suite and its defensibility in their respective ecosystems, what value Blackberry brings to the world and various valuation metrics to justify a price target of over CAD$100.

The Blackberry product suite is largely deployed in hi-tech environments with sophisticated buyers seeking the highest security uncompromising in the sight of an indelicate user interface. This includes both its cybersecurity and QNX platforms.

QNX is vital to the self-driving ecosystem and will be the de-facto operating system at the point of multiple catalysts. This includes the first approved autopilot system in any jurisdiction, the first cybersecurity attack on a connected vehicle non QNX related and diamond handed people in WSB.

Title: Shorty gonna squeeze XL DD


A look into why XL is atop Short % lists

It is pretty straight forward.

XL Fleet short interest increased from 50% to 72% in the latest reporting (came out Friday)

That alone piqued my curiosity in the company so I took a position in some Feb calls 


Several days ago, Biden announced that he would be replacing the entire govt. fleet with electric vehicles and as we all know $WKHS got a massive pump on this news but that was about it.

Who are the other likely candidates? $GOEV and $XL 

Why is $XL one of the top candidates?
-Partnerships with Coke and Pepsi
-Board of Director members have strong ties with UPS and FedEx
-Management team is very connected in govt. associations for clean energy in wind, solar, and EV
- $XL is focused on transforming existing FLEETS
All of this can be found on their website

Next up, is Open Interest and float. Remember, $XL Fleet only has 8.25M shares of public float. Of that, 8.6% are institutionally owned (i.e. not going to be sold anytime soon)

That means there are roughly 7.6M shares of true float available.
At 7.6M shares, it only takes 76,000 call option contracts that are in the money (the strike is less below the current trading price) to lock up the ENTIRE FLOAT. This is very similar to what happened to $GME obviously we wont have god level 

So here is a quick table I put together so you can quickly see the Open Interest for call options on $XL 

https://imgur.com/gallery/3hzCbvQ

Notice how the OI spikes MASSIVELY on the C25 and C30, with a decent bit at C20 and C22.5

There are already nearly 40,000 contracts that are In The Money. Locking up 4M shares.

Total, there are over 144k option contracts that have been sold.

The crux of this comes when $XL hits $25/share. At that point, the contracts that are in the money lock up the ENTIRE FLOAT of $XL. 

And that isn't including new contracts that will be purchased on hype as it moves back up. 

If this hits $25, it quickly moves over $40 . . .
As shorts cover and new buyers enter the market. 

All this needs is a catalyst. And with how clean energy friendly the new Biden Administration is . . . well, that seems like a likely catalyst to me.

I am already in Feb/March calls. Will be adding to position next week.


TLDR load up on calls and shares cuz EV bout to be hot again!

Title: DD: Macro Economic Outlook For This Week And Beyond
Hello fellow Autists! I've been doing a lot of research and thinking today about where we're at right now and where do we go from here and I wanted to get it all written out for my own sake but I also might as well share with you guys.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Let me start off by saying that I'm not a financial advisor, nor am I an expert but I do follow the markets closely and I do listen to the experts.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that due to a number of factors that I will outline in this post that we could see a liquidity crisis in the next 1-4 weeks. Now before you start calling me a gay bear please hear me out.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As you retards have been yolo'ing FD's this has gamma squoze the shit out of the market. This is great until the market rolls over and the same dynamic goes against you. When prices go down, the MM's sell the shares they were using as a delta hedge and that makes prices go down faster.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What happened this week with RH and others halting trading on the meme names was a liquidity issue. RH drew down their $500M credit line and borrowed another $1B last week to try and keep up with you guys! Massive call buying causes the VIX to go up. VIX going up means the hedge funds, clearing houses and brokerage firms aren't allowed to operate on as much leverage. Low VIX = Leverage good, High Vix = Leverage Bad. If the VIX stays up all of these entities are going to have to sell off their positions to meet their collateral requirements. GME has more shares short than actually exist so if enough autist hold then they will never be able to fully cover. What happens then?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

High VIX means everybody needs to deleverage their positions which means stonks go down :(

There is a pending liquidity problem here. If you look at the chart of GDX for example you will see it always seems to diverge downward from SPY whenever there is a pending liquidity event. In general you would expect to see the TLT go up when the VIX goes up. More volatility means you want to flee to the safety of bonds right? Instead what we're seeing is TLT down while VIX is up. It's my view that TLT will come up and join the VIX very shortly.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'd like to point out that I'm not a gay bear, I'm a bull at heart. The thing is that if we can be prepared for the crash that's coming we can BTFD so hard. If we have nothing at the bottom then there is no money to BTFD!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

On Friday we saw stocks sell off to their weekly lows,  the VIX was quite high and bond yields were at their all time low. Low bond yields means people are not hedging their portfolios and / or they're selling bonds to cover their margin requirements. The hedge funds are now concerned that if the market continues to go down they will need to start to deleverage. There is more margin and call options out there right now than there has ever been. This is where that reverse gamma squeeze screws you over. This could cause a fast, sharp move lower. Think March 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In the treasury market last week the short term treasury yields fell to all time lows. Short interest for everyday stocks are at alltime lows. Put option volumes are at all time lows. As prices start going down, market participants realize they need to hedge their bets and so they buy puts. MM's short the stock in order to hedge their put sale and this is where the gamma squeeze to the downside exacerbates the move downward.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Even mutual funds are record long equity and record underweight bonds. As the market rolls over they will also need to sell equities to get into fixed income.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If you look at the SPY yearly chart there is bearish divergence over the past 2 months. What does that mean? RSI has been trending downwards will price has been continuing upwards. This is an indicator of a market trend reversal. The DMARK is also hitting daily, weekly, monthly and yearly high. This is very bearish as well. These signals don't necessarily mean that something that will for sure happen but it is pointing out that there is tons of risk in the system.

&amp;#x200B;

Now look at the Covid situation throughout the world. It is calming down somewhat but the problem is we're seeing new fast spreading strains of the virus that could easily turn the situation for the worse very quickly. This could lead to more shut downs which effects the economy and the market. So this begs the question, are all of these companies optimistic reflation projections realistic? What happens if / when they miss earning estimates?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So what do we do about this? First and foremost HOLD YOUR GME, AMC + BB shares. They might be the only stonks that goes up this week / month. Assuming you're not all in on GME, what do you do with your other money? Spy puts, TLT calls and Gold are where you want to be if you buy my idea that this could be March 2020 all over again.  I know these are all gay bear moves. Feel free to disagree with me in the comments!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Be careful out there guys!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** The market looks quite risky right now for a number of reasons. Could potentially be like last March. Hold your GME shares, hedge the crash with everything else.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Positions: GME Shares + SLV Calls + Cash, buying TLT Calls and Spy puts tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not a financial advisor, please do your own DD!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Please also read this DD I did this morning but I couldn't post so here is the link to the comment. I spent six hours on it and it's quite eye opening!

Title: Trading Tips for stocks and options. Part I
 I  though of sharing some trading tips and answers to questions Ive seen  multiple times on Discord over the last two weeks. If you are absolutely  new to stocks and options, you should start with likes of Investopedia  to learn basic mechanics and greeks. This post will focus on a little  less obvious things.

**1) I sold options and they became In the money. When will I get assigned?**

Technically,  you can get assigned at any moment since youve sold it. But if there  is any extrinsic value of an option contract (if your option is trading  higher than the difference between the strike price and the current  market price of a stock) it will almost never be exercised before  expiry. Watch out for these two events, though: hostile takeovers and  dividend trigger (if the dividend payed is higher than extrinsic value).  Well, also watch out for drunk idiots who exercise by mistake.

**2) Its expiry day. At what time will I get assigned?**

Most  often Option Clearing Corporation will trigger automatic assignment of  any ITM options, unless other is configured by the client in his  brokerage. The default automatic exercises and assignments processing  time is 16:00 pm Eastern Time. However, the OCC permits client manual  exercise decisions for until 17:30 EST.

**3) At 16:00 my sold options have expired worthless. Am I good?**

No,  as mentioned above  if the price in after hours moves and makes your  options ITM, they can still be assigned until 17:30. Especially be  cautious in the days of earnings or days when 13F are published   those  can move asset prices after hours quite a bit.

**4) Can I buy or sell options before/after hours?**

No,  generally you cant. The exceptions are very select instruments. Also,  some brokers offer exclusive packages and allow you to trade options  outside regular hours, but you will be, basically, trading with the  broker himself.

**5) How options and stocks are taxed if I exercise or get assigned?**

Options  premiums are added or subtracted to/from the base price of the stock.  Say, you bought calls strike price 100, for 10$ premium. On the day of  expiry the price of your stock has gone up to 200, Your calls are now  worth 100$, but you still believe that the stock price can go even  higher, you would prefer to own and hold that stock. You can sell those  call contracts and be taxed for profits of 90$ per contract. But if you  exercise your contracts, your base price will be 110$ per contract and  your profit will be your future sale price minus 110$. Works in a  similar way with puts, and short positions in options.

*Disclaimer*: this might not be accurate for all jurisdictions and accounts. This is not an accounting advise, please contact professionals!

**6) Why my options are losing value even though the underlying stock went in my direction (up for calls, down for puts)?**

Options  prices are more complex than simply tracking the performance of a  stock. Again, it is useful to learn the greeks. But to start, you should  understand two most useful aspects: time decay and Implied Volatility.  If you have short term expiring Out of the money options, their price  will decline even if the price of a stock goes in your direction, but  not fast enough.

Implied  Volatility can be described as market sentiment and expectancy of price  changes. The higher is the belief that the price will change  the more  expensive are the options (especially with low delta). For example, If  you bought calls after 3 days of insane volatility, but then the next  weeks it moved up for only 1 or 2%, your calls will likely not gain, but  rather lose value, because you bough them at the peak of IV, and since  the volatility seemingly settled down, the market no longer expects huge  moves and is no longer eager to pay big premium for your options.

There  can be also so-called unusual activity. Thats basically large amounts  of purchases of some particular options outstanding against the general  flow. Those events can change premiums for a period of time too and  often indicate a start of a new trend.

**7) Can I do a Poor Man Covered Call on a cash account?**

Poor  Man Covered Call is a strategy of selling OTM calls but having a deep  ITM call as a hedge. It imitates covered calls strategy. Some people  assume, that since this strategy caps your downside risk, this will be  allowed on a cash account. This is false. Cash accounts allow no naked  options selling, even if your max loss is caped.

**8) What is Settled cash and Free Riding Rule?**

Most  trades have settling periods. For stocks it is T+2 (the day you traded +  2 business days) and for most options its the next day. This means,  that if you sold something, the cash is not immediately delivered to  your account. Brokers will still allow you to buy with unsettled cash.  This is called Free Riding. But if you sell anything you bought with  unsettled cash  they will give you a 90 days restriction for violation  of Free Riding Rule. This is very uncomfortable.

This applies only to cash accounts.

**9) If I added to a position under Free Riding Rule, can I still sell if Im within limits of what I bought before?**

No.  For example, if you had 100 shares for a long time, but bought 10 more  shares under Free Riding, even if you then sell only 1 share before cash  is settled, you will still get a 90 day restriction. At least on most  brokers that I know.

**10) Can I sell covered calls when I have 0$ settled cash on cash account?**

Not  on all brokers. Some brokers will treat selling covered calls as if you  are using formal 0% margin. And since you have 0$ settled cash, your  cash doesnt exceed your 0% margin. Sounds moronic, but thats how it  works. You might be caught in this situation if you are rolling covered  calls on a cash account: you buyback those contracts, get bellow your  settled cash and then cant sell new covered calls until next business  day.

**11) How to save on commissions if Im not using a commission-free broker?**

Some  brokers allow you to configure your orders with numerous options. First  of all, dont use their smart algorithms or any kinds of quirky  special sauces - 9 times out of 10 you will get both worse execution  and bigger commissions. Secondly, if configurable, always ask for an  All-or-None orders.  This will ensure that your order will be much more  likely filled from one source and on one exchange, thus minimizing your  commission. Finally, there are exchanges that offer traders rebates for  added liquidity. For example NYSE Arca (PSE) and BATS offer rebates to  customers for added liquidity in options trading. Yes, you will get a  cashback for your trades. Configure destination of your orders to select  those exchanges. Note: some brokers will provide those rebates to their  users and some will just take it themselves. Note 2: rebates are  offered for adding liquidity; for removing liquidity you will still get  charged.

Hope this helps! Feel free to write your questions if you have some. And good luck with your trades!

Title: BLNK charging DD + short interest DD
**There are many new people here, I do not want this to be a distraction. If you have EXTRA money and are already hodling GME, or cannot afford GME you should join the BLNK train.**

So let me preface this by saying **BLNK** will not be the next **GME**. There will probably not be another **GME**. For starters it's not going to have an army of kids who used to shop there 15 years ago hyping it, not to mention over 100% short interest and the fact that in the early days it wasn't even 1b dollar market cap.. But it can a squeeze of it's own for it's own reasons entirely and so I have spent time looking beyond just the stock price movements which is what initially led me to start the idea of a **BLNK** DD. I do want to point out some things I noticed while the big squeeze started happening.

* A lot of companies with high short interest such as **IRBT** and **BLNK**, along with those more talked about companies such as **AMC** just started causing the shorts to cover all sorts of positions and move their money around. **BLNK** share price was up to about 65 dollars before falling down to 50 over the past 2 days. It has reached 55 dollars in the past so this wasn't even a squeeze it was just a few shorts deciding to cover their positions most likely because they were getting reamed elsewhere, or just a natural run up because people seem to really like **BLNK** stock. As a matter of fact, they like it so much that it is up *2400%* from 1 year ago. And it's still got relatively small market cap though we aren't in the millions anymore.
* If **BLNK** were to actually squeeze as hard as some of these other companies  have been and somehow reach **GME**'s current 20b dollar market cap it's share price would be $500 dollars. There are plenty of companies with 20 billion dollar market cap. If it just pulled an **AMC** and only jumped 200% in a day it would still be at 150 dollars. Of course if you believed **GME** squeezed already you're obviously mistaken yourself, but the sentence still applies that **BLNK** 10x would still leave it at only 20b market cap.

Is this realistic? Lets take a look at the ways in which **BLNK** is SETTING ITSELF UP to make money in the future, and I say that because as we go into details later you will realized they are currently not exactly succeeding financially, though when has that stopped a company from turning into a success in the past? We will also take a little bit of look at the short interest. Also, these are the kinds of companies who continue to gain more short interest as the price continues to rise.

Okay so **BLNK** is not some new company who just started because of the EV hype, **BLNK** has been a public company since only 2018 but has been a private company since 2008. They had a different name, but merged and acquired a few companies or something, and somehow ended up with the name **BLNK**. Many companies fight for years to break out of the depths of nothingness into a sound business model. According to their CEO: They design, manufacture, maintain, own, and operate charging stations. Their main business goal is to be the owner and operator, so they can be the fuel of the future. They put their focus on areas where you have no other choice but to use public charging.

**BLNK revenue comes from a few different things:**

* **Selling charging equipment:** They sell to third parties Okay, this is not great, but when you add the fact that they are **VERTICALLY INTEGRATED** it really changes the narrative a bit. **AAPL** just decided to go vertically integrated by designing building their own chips for their products, when you design your product and control the supply chain you can make greater strides to improving your margins and expanding your business through natural growth.
* **Utilization**: from people utilizing their charging stations, this is standard and easy to understand. They apparently pay about .12 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity and charge about .39 cents per kilowatt hour. These are pretty good margins and once more than 50% of the cars are the road become EVs this is going to grow exponentially. This will obviously take time but might not be as far away as people are trying to say either.
* **Network of charging stations:**  **BLNK** has it's own cloud based network which will collected *recurring* fees every month. It will also need to be managed, which is also recurring fees. This is also where shit gets interesting because they can use data integration of the network on top of utilization. Of course utilization is going to cost people money but what do we know about companies abilities to collect and sell data in the **AGE OF DATA**? We know that **DATA** is the next oil, that's something we do know, how long and how far will people go to learn your every move, where you charge your car, what stores you're nearby, for how long, etc. This data is will be worth money in time. (side note: **PLTR** LEAPS AFTER THE LOCKUP TARDS)

**BLNK Expansion, Growth, Partnerships, Deals, Future revenue streams**

* **BLNK** recently acquired BlueLA, an EV carsharing company. This was a big move for a little company with negative earnings and cash flow, the fact that they are acquiring things leads me to believe they are actively trying to expand, and beyond just chargers as well. They seem committed to take on the EV industry without being a car manufacturer.
* **BLNK** inked a deal with Cushman and Wakefield, for those of you who do not know they are a global commercial real estate services firm.
* International expansion. **BLNK** has a deal in Greece with **Nissan** to provide chargers to anyone who buys an electric **Nissan**. These people will get access to all of **BLNK**'s network. Let me inform you simpletons who have never left your moms basement, in other countries they are taking the whole EV movement more serious than America has been for some time, with certain countries already having pledged to ban gas powered cars by certain dates. I know the USA is making strides too and not to mention we have Elon but even if penetration is slow here it will not be slow internationally.
* **BLNK** announced on Dec. 15th it was signing an *exclusive* deal with Blessing Health System.
* When **BLNK** signs these types of exclusive deals it often times has contracts for 5-15 years to be the sole provider of charging within the property, this includes charging of all types of equipment not only electric cars.
* **BLNK** received a grant aimed at facilitating the deployment of 200 Blink Fast Level 2 - 19.2 kW charging stations across the mid-Atlantic region, including locations in Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia and Washington, DC. I smell more grants with incoming administration.
*  On 28th of July, **BLNK** and **ENS** entered an agreement  to jointly develop high-power wireless and enhanced DC (direct current for you actual retards) fast charging (DCFC) systems with integrated battery storage for the transportation market. This shows they are looking ahead and willing to work with whoever they need to stay on top of the technology. The resulting DCFC charging solution with high power energy storage will purportedly feature a modular design, and a power output from 100-500 kW. Supposedly it is going to be economically priced. They are going to look like the concrete parking guard things we see all over the place and they will be able to wireless charge certain vehicles is the idea.
* On the topic of DC chargers (non wireless). **TSLA** uses this same tech for it's superchargers. What else are DC chargers going to allow in the future? Bi directional charging! With bi-directional charging you can go Vehicle to Grid or Vehicle to Home . This means cars can one day be used to help balance energy needs by allowing EVs to charge during off peak hours and give back during peak hours. This is futuristic shit. Lots of stuff to be excited about. If you are confused and don't care about the future, all you need to know today is that direct current chargers have the converter in the charger itself, so they are bigger and faster at charging cars than the AC converters which have to have an onboard converter which converts AC into DC to feed the battery.  It is also going to lead to people to wanting and needing more advanced charging solutions in their home rather than using the "well I can just charge over night" logic with a slow level 1 charger. Having the charger do the conversion is the way of the future. This is the way.
* **VERTICAL INTEGRATION**. Did I fucking mention they are a vertically integrated charging company? This is huge. This needs reiteration. This means they design their own product plus build their own infrastructure out, not to mention provide own their own network, technicians, everything. It is very ambitious and nobody knows how far **BLNK** can take their business yet, but what we do know is that EVs are the future and it is still only the beginning of the EV revolution. Advantages of Vertical Integration include lower costs, faster getting products to consumers, less supply disruption or them raising the price on the company, less transportation costs and reduced delivery turnaround times, improved sales and profitability. I really think this is big to the companies growth trajectory yet it is not widely available information about the company.

**Some Other Points to Consider**

* Supposedly **BLNK** has the only 80 amp level 2 charging station currently on the market. Why does this matter to the small brained? That means it's faster than other chargers you say? Sure, that could be technically true, if that's what it was used for. Then why does it matter? Because **BLNK** chargers have **load-sharing capabilities**. The **BLNK** IQ 200 has the ability to load-share between 2 and 20 units from a single 100 amp feed. This is going to be a game changer for apartments, hospitals, any MUD's, honestly any commercial space that has access to a hundred amp feed. They will be able to service many cars with that single feed. But it gets better, the IQ 200 can intelligently share power, and even queue up cars that are plugged in but not charging, so that they can charge once other cars finish charging. **BLNK** envisions higher output being necessary to facilitate larger companies electric fleets, which we can now see happening in the EV space with trucks and couriers looking to go electric. 
* **BLNK**'s pricing scheme seems to be superior to that of **Chargepoint**. For those of you who do not know **Chargepoint** is another EV charging company, who was recently acquired by **SBE** and they are voting in February to finalize everything I believe. With **Chargepoint** they just sell the chargers to apartments and such and let them determine the pricing. They only manage the network. This means if you have to fill your battery up you have to constantly double check prices to see if you are getting reamed from one of their chargers vs another one. On **BLNK**'s network they will charge the same price everywhere. This is a huge plus in my eyes. I am a little unclear which policy would be in effect for chargers that **BLNK** does not have on it's network, because as I've said it does sell equipment as well.
* **BLNK** has mobile chargers with the same power as their IQ 200 but in a mobile factor in case you run out of fuel on the road.
* **BLNK** does not give a shit to what kind of car you drive, it wasn't to fuel all electric vehicles of the future.
* Fleets are coming, **BLNK** seems ready for this.
* **BLNK** can have partnerships with and target the following sectors which we already see some starting to play out: Parking &amp; Services, Commercial &amp; Residential, Workplace, Healthcare, Education, Retail, Hospitality/Food &amp; Beverage, Entertainment, Governmental.
* Consumer stores that add EV charging stations tend to see costumers staying in their stores longer according to data which I have not seen. This reiterates the point about being able to collect money from data.
* So you may or may not know that in the USA **TSLA** still owns about 80% market share of EVs. We also know this will not last forever as every car company and their mother's boyfriend on top of car companies we've never even heard of are all on the EV bandwagon right now. This is going to make a lot of cars that need charging stations and it will be impossible for any one company to win this battle we can safely assume there will be 2-4 major players.
* Low estimates are expecting the amount of charging stations in America to jump from between a quarter and a half million now, depending on if you are counting Gen 1, to low estimates stating there will be between 13 and 14 million charging stations over the next 7 or 8 years.

**The Possible Concerns that keep getting thrown around**

* **BLNK** seems to be issuing more public shares from time to time (yes, dilution) but we know that when a company is trying to raise capital to expand this is a common strategy, and I don't really think is something to be worried about as long as you believe EV's are really going to be the future. I do.
* **BLNK**'s owner and CEO Michael D Farkas sold shares last month, to the tune of 22 million dollars worth. This always makes companies look bad but many people who own and operate a business would scrape some off the top to support their family in case things don't go according to plan, not everyone is an Elon (and Elon was still set before **TSLA** lets be real), doesn't mean he is necessarily up to no good. Not to mention if shorts were attacking you with even shorter shorts every day would it not worry you a bit that they win? This is an ongoing battle for small companies that don't get along with Wall Street. Plus, he still has 6.7 million shares, he only sold about 540,000 for 22 million dollars. This is a drop in the bucket and the man should not be faulted for this, my opinion is that it is no warning sign.
* This might end up being a competitive space that could lower margins and cause financial hardships for the company. This is an actual concern. It could also take a lot longer than people are expecting to achieve meaningful penetration fully electric cars. I do think **BLNK** being poised to expand internationally will help them offset some of this.
* EV is just a bubble blah blah blah blah okay then don't buy any EV stocks, you might be right but you're also a little bitch.

&amp;#x200B;

**BACK TO SHORT SHORTS**

&amp;#x200B;

So if the last data I see on yahoo says that that the float is around 27 or 28 million. This is what's not held by insiders, who are unlikely to sell right now due to the fact that everyone knows we are collectively fucking over people who traditionally fuck them over. If a few weeks ago there was 8.8 million shares shorted and the average daily trading volume as of last week close was 14,263,640. This would make it a modest  .61 days to cover. While it's no **GME**, I do believe this is a pretty large short ratio. Especially when you consider how small the public float is. I do believe this situation will be amplified the further **BLNK** moves away from it's "valuation." Also with what we've seen this week these people are willing to double down on things because apparently maybe they are just as retarded as we are. 

So **BLNK**'s short interest is increasing at a rate of about 20% per every 20 dollars the stock rises. This is only a simple estimate based off of quick calculations but you can see that Dec. 15 the stock price was 28 dollars and amount of shares shorted was 6.18 million. On Jan 15th  the share price was $47 and the total amount of shares sold short were 8.8 million. That's about 23%. As of right now it's still less than a day to cover but that does not mean we can't see things get frothy from this point on. Most people think **BLNK**'s chance of success sit somewhere around the 0-3% mark I'd estimate based on the general sentiment not only here on WSB but also anywhere else on the internet you look. The consensus seems to be to stay away from it.

Months back some shady research company probably wrote a hit piece on **BLNK** causing it's share price to tank nearly 50%, it had no real substance, none of the claims were found to have any evidence of being true and it is being investigated by the SEC and such, This same company ran an inaccurate hit piece on **CLSK** some time ago. Culper Research is the name if you'd like to look it up and read the hit piece. **BLNK** managed to defeat the shorts that time but will they again? 

Did I mention who else hates **BLNK** charging? **SHITRON** himself. Here's a quote from the shitman himself back in November:

Shitron said, "**BLNK**s valuation makes no sense" and called the company a total scheme. Left said it is insulting to call **BLNK** an EV stock.

New most ridiculous EV stock is $**BLNK**. No $$ for R&amp;D, management accused of securities fraud, no real revenues, Shitron tweeted.

This goes without saying but every word that comes out of that mans mouth is horse shit. You know this. At this point, literally the whole world knows this. It's not even a question of does he write things based off of any evidence, we all know he would only say negative things that are to cause companies to go down because he has a position shorting them. Does he still have a position? Who knows, but we can safely assume at least at one point he did.

**I try not to use the** ***F*** **word but here goes a bit of simple** ***Fundamentals*** **for you tards:**

Current market cap: **1.85b** Don't need to remind you guys this is still tiny and can still go through some explosive growth at a market cap this small in todays world with the amount of retail investors that throw their money at the most retarded shit you could ever possibly think of, for reference look at **NKLA**. Pretty sure **NKLA** reached a 20b dollar market cap at one point.

**BLNK** has negative earnings per share, and although their revenue is increasing a good amount from quarter to quarter and beating expectations they only earned about 2.26 million last quarter. 

Last quarter GAAP EPS: -.12

Operating Income: -3.50 M

Profit margin: -285.81% 

Return on Equity: -97.33% This tells you how well they are spending their money. 

Yes those are negatives. Impressive, to say the least.

As a matter of fact just about everything you read about this company screams "***SHORT ME!***" Think about how many rich powerful scumbags are trying to run this company into the ground. Are they right? Or is EV charging just the future that has not come yet!? What I take from this is that they are spending every dollar they have trying to make it. This is all or nothing for this company. 

**Final Thoughts**

Can we think of any other companies with negative earnings per share that still ended up being great success stories? It's almost like that hasn't been the blueprint for the past 10 years now.. Will it work? Only time will tell. But it definitely will not if these short sellers have their way with it. Also for reference just look at **QS**'s 16b dollar market cap and they don't even have a product. **BLNK** at least has products that are currently going out into the world to be used. Of course the real move could just be puts on **QS,** but I stay out of bear territory especially during bull feeding frenzies. My outlook is that Billions are just the Millions of some years ago, especially when we're printing Trillions out of thin air (Obligatory shout out to the printer man himself **JPOW**). Just remember that we live in a brave new world where kids with phone apps can invest in what they believe the future is going to look like.

Lastly, this is a stock no one has restricted trading to yet, allowing people to buy more than 2-3 shares could seriously cause **BLNK** to quadruple in value. We've seen how fast small market cap companies can jump when millions of autists all buy shares at the same time. Strength in numbers. The revolution of the retail investor has only begun my friends.

Remember I'm just a retard not a financial advisor so this is not advice or anything but I'll let my positions speak for themselves:

**GME** 500 c jan 29 (RIP I TRIED TO IGNITE THE INFINITE GAMMA SQUEEZE GUYS, I DID MY PART AND BOUGHT THAT SHIT ON THURSDAY, GUESSING IF 500C WENT IN THE MONEY IT WAS GOING TO IGNITE A DOMINO EFFECT, I TRIED AND FAILED BUT I LOVE YOU ALL, BUYING MORE SHARES ON MONDAY)

**GME** shares

**PLTR** 30c May 2021

**BB** 14c Jan 2023

**BLNK** 14c Jan 2022

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: **BLNK** is the only vertically integrated EV charging company, **BLNK** has international presence, **BLNK** shares are up 2400% in the past year. It will take .61 days to cover and this number DEFINITELY rising, very small amount of float available, Shitron hates **BLNK**, so do all other short sellers, make no mistake they have put the hit out on **BLNK** and would love to see it run into the ground, **BLNK** is small enough to still rocketship pretty hard, **GME** to the moon.

Title: $BB UPDATED DD  PLEASE DELEVERAGE, HEDGE, or TAKE SOME PROFIT  MOVEMENT IS NOT ORGANIC!!!
Not financial advice 

Some of you know Im a big BB bull on $BB 

I love the stock, I love the company, I love John Chen, but its finally clear why BB has been moving the way it has, in tandem with GME 

Prem Watsa is a huge BB investor and owns a large stake 

Guess who Watsa has beef with? Steve Cohen, the guy supporting Melvin in GME, the final boss so to speak of Point72 with deep ties to Citadel  

[Watsa vs Cohen beef](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.theglobeandmail.com/amp/globe-investor/fairfax-e-mails-come-back-to-haunt-a-wall-street-titan/article571008/)

These are billionaires in financial warfare, with Cohens group having TONS more capital, political leverage, and media influence than Watsas measly long side

Steve Cohens tried to kill Watsas Fairfax fund. In turn killing Blackberry. Everyone always thought that Facebook had a hand in suppressing BB stock, turns out it was always Cohens group that were the hostile players with MASSIVE capital that have been punishing BlackBerry for years.

Its obvious now why BB SP has been so low in the market. Its because Steve Cohen has tried to squash it due to his beef with Watsa. Same thing theyve been doing with GameStop, but BlackBerry is more personal for Cohen 

Dont believe me? Look at the daily chart for GME and BB 

GME had its first squeeze on Jan 13th, from $20 to $40. 100% gain. This was an astronomical loss for Melvin, who is backed by Cohen 

Guess when Blackberry began its epic run? Check the chart... Jan 14th, MASSIVE green candle 

December 22nd, random and short BB surge out of nowhere, was so random it shocked me as I thought it might even halt for news. The move faded. 

Check GME chart December 22nd, same day GME posted its first big power move from $16 to almost $20. Again Cohen group taking the edge of BB and moving it to GME. Clear as day now. 

This BB surge is Cohens group backing off their BB short, pushing the price up, and shoring up enough funds to move to GME which was hemorrhaging HUGE outflows. Retail and momentum exasperated this move in BB

This is so God damn obvious now in hindsight. This is why BB has been moving in tandem with GME 

This movement is not organic, has nothing to do with fundamentals, or even Blackberry itself!

This is a war between Cohen (Point72, Citadel, Melvin) and anonymous long hedge funds + retail. These anonymous long hedge funds are either using retail or are siding with retail. In the end, funds dont give a shit about anything besides profit. So be careful, they dont care about sending any message

Investing in BB right now is investing in Cohen losing his shirt in GME

I know Ill get hated for this but its true and needs to be said 

CONSIDER: 

1) Deleverage, get off margin, dont YOLO
2) Hedge with puts 
3) Scale some out 

Youre investing in between a financial tug of war that runs deep and is directly tied to the outcome of GME. You are not investing in fundamentals of BlackBerry right now! If Cohen uses political leverage which it looks like he has already, stabilizes his position in GME, he will go on the offensive and come back for blood in BB. Just be careful. This is crazy stuff.

Edit: LOL this place has gone wild and become an echo chamber. Fuck it, I hope Cohen gets destroyed and jailed, TO THE FUCKING MOON BOYS!!!!

Title: NYSE tweet "hghghg" - Symbolic interpretation (Buy GME)
Hg is the chemical symbol for Mercury.  

Mercury is also the Roman god of financial gain, commerce, luck, trickery and thieves.

Mercury was known to the greeks as hermes.  Hermes Trismagestrus means Hermes thrice great.  If Hermes and Mercury are the same, then Hermes thrice great = Mercury Mercury Mercury = HgHgHg.

Hermes Trismagestrus was thought to have known the three parts of the wisdom of the whole universe - Alchemy, Magic, and Astrology.  Alchemists turn things into gold.  

The number 3 is also symbolic of Abundance, or opportunity.

So either NYSE is saying that there's a lot of opportunity for financial gain, the only question is whether or not it's by buying GME, or milking the retail investors for all they've got.

Hg is also a private equity firm that targets buyouts primarily in Europe and the US.  So maybe they're saying their name 3 times in hopes they show up.

Do what you will with this knowledge.

Title: FUCK SILVER. Here's the move AFTER the squeeze has squoze: Cannabis! 
EDIT: Downvote all you want SLV shills. Marijuana ain't goin anywhere and neither am I. . 

What's up apes, autists, retards, degenerates, and every other person with fuckin 's. I first want to say my 5 shares of GME at $310 love every last one of you idiots, and *I'm NOT FUCKIN LEAVIN*. Our job isn't done, but at this point it's a waiting game for Melvin to realize this sub **will stay retarded longer than they stay solvent** We *like* this stock, and we *like* that game. In the words of the wise Papa Chamath "I will win." 


**BUT WHAT ABOUT AFTER THE SQUEEZE IS SQUOZE?** What are you planning to do with your platter of tendies and squeeze cheese? Looking for ideas? Hear me out retards about a stock I like, and no I'm not gonna TLDR. I need the smart apes to hear me out.

While we have all eyes on us, instead of taking on JP Morgan, let's help out the **millions** of future retards currently sitting in prison wishing they could join our moon missions.

**No one wants to be seen as targeting shorts** and I want to make it clear, that is NOT the intention here. This is a company with wildly large **catalysts** coming very soon, and already starting to boil. **EVERYONE SHOULD DEMAND TO KNOW THE SHORT LOGIC** instead of defending long positions, especially with an amazing year ahead.

Title: HOW TO BYPASS GAMESTOP BUY RESTRICTIONS: EXERCISE CALLS

mods pleasPLEAS

This has been posted before but I think its VERY important to know, maybe even should be pinned.


We dont know if/which brokerages will be instituting buy-order restrictions on GME etc this week.   If anyone who is interested (and can afford to) still wants to buy shares, know that it is still possible to EXERCISE your call options.  By exercising, they are required to give you the 100 shares you bought.

**How does it work?**


ELI5:  each Call contract is for 100 shares at the strike price.  Youd want to purchase deep ITM Calls, with minimal extrinsic value left in the contract.  On Robinhood, this is manifested as the To Break Even%, where this number would ideally be 0% for immediate exercise.

https://imgur.com/a/5VGZvxZ

On other brokerages such as ToS displayed in the link as well, you may just have to do some quick maths to figure out the relative costs.


**How do I know if exercising is worth it?**

Immediately Exercising a Call is supposed to be similar to buying 100 shares outright, right?  But since immediate exercise isnt how options are usually used, there will be some extra costs involved.

Math:

If $GME is at $300, it would cost $30,000 to buy 100 shares at $300 each.  
**100 shares = $30,000**

If we do this via a (theoretical) option:
Lets say GME is at $300 still.  And lets say the $45 strike Call for Feb.5 costs $285 each.  Youll pay that $285 to buy the contract.  Now if you want to exercise that contract, you will pay another $45 for each of the 100 shares youre exercising the right to buy.
In this example, (45+285)*100 = 33,000
**100 shares = $33,000**


*(strike price + contract cost) x 100 = the cost to immediately buy 100 shares via options*



Obviously this isnt ideal,  but if RobbingHood et. al. continue their restrictions, this will likely be how I will purchase shares of a stock I like.   I would likely be paying an extra premium per share as you saw, *BUT WHO CARES ABOUT PAYING EXTRA IF WERE GOING TO THE MOON ANYWAY*


**How do I exercise an option (on RobbingHood??**

On RH theres a handy little Exercise button when you click on your Call.  Youd just click through the screens to do it.  https://imgur.com/a/BGKCnz1



Im sorry if formatting is bad and the explanation was *quick and dirty* but I have a feeling many of us will be stuck holding and unable to buy shares outright once again.  If you have questions I Will try to answer in the comments, and if anyone has something better to explain then feel free.

*not financial advice, dumbass*
 P.S. get fucked CNBC
P.P.S. mods pls post
edit fucking forgot  Im so sorry

Title: Reminder on GME, why we like the stock
GME

This has escalated faster than my dick when DFV posts, While pretty much everyone who bought into GME sub 20 knew there were massive tendies to be made, not single person in this entire scenario expected it to play out like this.  


Lets take a step back and review the FACTS, amidst the bot attacks, fake news, and overall noise coming from the powers at be.

1. **Gamestops long term prospects look good: marketing, $$$ and more $$$**

fundamentals are what we care about as the business needs to go through a paradigm shift in its model, thankfully, it has. We can all thank new daddy cohen for making this happen by investing in the long term strategy for revamping a business that was on its way out. He involved himself on the board, brought in his former chewy associates, and is making bigly moves to start setting up their pivot. Gamestop would naturally start to increase as speculators saw serious financial backing from an independent investor with an alignment between management and shareholders starting to form. Obviously when board members and c-suits are shareholders they have vested interest in the performance of the company, if you go and [read wikipedia on gme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop) you will see that they did not have any shareholders in upper level management, until 2019 which helped create the situation we are in, if the people running the company do not care about the value of it, they have no concern to prevent the value from being destroyed. So yay, management now gives a fuck. we have our first ingredient, ***aligned $$$***

Now on to the second ingredient, big $$$

Gamestop has to finance its operations for 2019 and 2020 as it went deep into the red, the lack of free cash flow and poor sales prospects drilled their credit rating to emerging market status, and set them up to fail if they could not find profits again, which with shit management is to be expected. With the new interest from stakeholders, GME took off, gaining market cap, and opening up a new avenue of financing. Even if GME hit a modest market cap of lets say 6.5bb, they would have been able to raise money without diluting the float by much. But now with a market cap approaching 20+bb its becoming absurdly easy for them to raise capital, hell even raising a cool billion becomes viable now via a secondary offering.   Gamestop has become a self fulfilling prophecy as of no amount of shorting can sustain a low value for the stock, so they have a solid avenue to raise more cash. Which in turn means they can pay off their debt, increase their credit rating, and what do you know all of the sudden they can become profitable again.   


third ingredient: attention and faith.

self explanatory, the whole hedge fund situation has brought more media attention to gamestop than any other form of marketing, now literally everyone and their mother will know about GME forever and a lot of people who used to engage with the brand are now flocking back. Now combine that with the faith that new daddy cohen has inspired you have a recipe for MASSIVE TENDIES

&amp;#x200B;

now when we combine, aligned monetary interests, with new financing capability, huge investor confidence on management AND brand awareness. well fuck me thats one hell of a grand slam. 

with these few ingredients GME can cook up so many tendies, we already know they are working on making PC gaming more mainstream, and with all the renewed interest they can definitely pivot to some more interesting revenue streams, think the nintendo center in NYC for the heads who know, gamestops could become these social venues where gamers meet up and play together, or maybe hangout and have a beer. adult gaming and entertainment is actually taking off with the millennials and I expected it to be a serious path forward for gamestop. maybe not exactly like a video game bar, but some form of live social-gaming experience is something that I think is highly likely they will integrate. 

2. The financial institutions have their back against the wall, nothing can save them other than a gov bailout, its really a matter of closing the loss on the way down.

There is no fucking way on this planet that these shorters walk away from this in one piece, i do not think they will become insolvent because you know, wall street, but there is no way they do not take heavy losses. The sheer grit from new comers, lurkers, big names, and OGs is unspeakable. people have taken this scenario personally and people are just throwing money at this simply to say, BEARS R FUKT HEDGIES EAT COCK, which is not something this hedge fuckers could have seen coming. They have an innate arrogance that prevents them from considering such things. They know how much money they control, how to influence the right people, and their all homies with the important people so why should they care about the little guy when they can bend us over and fuck us whenever they want? well jokes on them cuz my wife's boyfriend already went to pound town and my ass can handle the pain. And guess what? SO CAN EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS GAME NOW, people are just buying, buying, and then buying some more, no matter the financial hurt, the buy side pressure has not and will not degrade(maybe when we hit 500+ a share since a lot of people might get priced out then) but it is a losing battle for them as every retail buy takes another share off the market. So they are in a pretty pickle. the longer they wait us out, the fewer shares they have to work with. The higher the price the more they bleed, the more they short, the worse it gets. Basically the longer they wait the more fucked they are, so HOLD because they will be trying everything we have seen this past week on us to get us to sell, become distracted, create FUD, prevent us from buying, restrict options, you name it. 

&amp;#x200B;

All we need are these two points and you can start to see how there is literally no way out for these guys, the challenge, the real challenge ( that gives us our diamond hands) is waiting. yes PATIENCE, as buffet has once said, " The stock market is a device to transfer money from the impatient to the patient". WE ARE THE PATIENT, WE ARE STRONG TOGETHER, WE ARE THE FUCKING PLAYERS. And the hedgies know it. they are the impatient ones as each day they lose money, and each day they have to ***work*** to remain afloat. Every single person on this sub does not need to do shit other than buy GME when you see it at a price you like and never sell until the shorts have bled all their capital. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; GameStop has all the ingredients to generate, real long term value for their shareholders, be patient. The shorts have already lost, its a matter of how much now, be patient, the hedgies have to work everyday to figure out how to unfuck themselves, while we just has to scroll WSB and find confirmation bias DD like this one. pretty simple, be patient, watch shorts cry, make unlimited tendies. DO NOT LET ANYONE INFLUENCE YOUR DECISION ON WHETHER TO BUY OR SELL GME, MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS AND STAND BY THEM. I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL, THESE ARE MY OPINIONS, NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE

Title: The only Nokia DD you need.
First and foremost this is not financial advice. You use your money exactly how you see fit and take responsibly for your own trades. Secondly this is not a "squeeze" play.

Nokia is one of the largest telecommunication companies in the world, as well as one of the front running companies for 5G.  Nokia now has a significant hold in all of the worlds early 5G adopters. Including deals with the top four communication service providers in the United States as well as the top three providers in Japan and Korea. Multinational contracts and deals have placed Nokia at the top when it comes to 5G and it will only be getting bigger when 5G is more accessible to people like us. Last week we ran Nokia up to almost 9 dollars before multiple halts stopped all the momentum. Then the trading restrictions on Robinhood and other brokerages hurt the momentum even more. I believe this was to help the hedge funds cover there ass before the inevitable movement up were going to have in the future. With trade restrictions being lifted on most platforms and earnings coming on Thursday we should see a big move up. This is a value company, with huge room for growth. The hedge funds manipulated this hard dropping from 6 to 4.60. We will not let them win and short another great company into the ground. Nokia is one of the most undervalued stocks on the market. The more we go up the more hedge funds will try and short. Buy shares and hold for a long time. This is a great company.

1. Most essential 5G patents in the world.
2. Fastest 5G speeds recorded.
3. Controls over 27% of the 5G market.
4. First company contracted to set up internet on the moon (NASA/SpaceX)
5. Multi billion dollar settlements from ongoing litigations with Mercedes Benz and Lenovo.
6. Technology provider and main collaborator of the National Security Center of Excellence 5G Cybersecurity Project (Federal 5G project).
7. Selected to be the main collaborator of the Hexa 6G European Union Project.
8. Pending Department of Defense contracted yet to be awarded.
9. Sealed a contract with T-Mobile for US 5G roll out.
10. Taking market share share from Huawei, already has secured multi year deals with important Chinese companies.
11. Blackrock increased their position 333,000,000 shares during 2020, an increase of 21 million shares held from the year before. (7% increase)

Title: Something to Keep in Mind for the Week Ahead
**SELL LIMIT ORDERS CAN BE SEEN BY THE MARKET**

Before breaking down why this is important, let's quickly recap some of the highlights of last week:

GameStop had one of its first big pops to open the market Wednesday and remained volatile all day. Thursday, it opened with another significant pop, and then HFs employed some perfectly timed and very illegal market manipulation tactics. Some of the largest brokerages with the most retail investors blocked the purchase of GME shares, and only allowed the current investors to sell the stock. HFs coupled this restriction in free trade with what is commonly referred to as a short ladder attack, which is another form of market manipulation to fabricate the illusion that a stock is plummeting. Newly invested retail traders watched this play-out over the course of the day, and with only the option to sell and seeing their initial investment plummet quickly probably sold the shares, freeing them for Hedge Funds to scoop up. 

Friday morning opened with another pop and the SEC issued a statement that they will be closely monitoring the price volatility of certain stocks, which put HFs on notice, and publicly acknowledged that they are paying attention to the situation. Meanwhile, trade across many of the brokerages that had previously blocked their customers from buying reopened the option to buy, but with significant restrictions. 

**TL;DR RE: LAST WEEK **

Starting Wednesday, GME opened everyday with a big pop likely due to the fever pitch of news and interest combined with HFs slowly covering their positions. Tomfoolery was rampant as HFs tried to tamp down a potentially imminent squeeze. 

**SELL LIMIT ORDERS **

Okay, so why are sell limit orders so important this coming week? Or many of you may even be asking WHAT IS a sell limit order? To borrow a very succinct analogy: if you are an  holding a , the sell limit order is the number you tell your brokerage you're willing to sell your for. This number can be seen by the market, and the HFs can see these numbers, but more importantly, they can see ALL of them. This is key because depending on how long you've been tracking GME on WSB, you have likely seen several comments saying something along the lines of "$420.69 IS NOT A MEME" and it has continually increased from 1k, 5k, 10k, etc. Which is where we get to the meat of this post because if everyone sets the sell limit orders to these memeable numbers, the HFs can see these massive clusters of sell orders and WILL buy them, which will trigger massive drops in share price, and in turn likely cause panic selling much like we saw during the short ladder attack on Thursday. So what next?

**I DONT FUCKING KNOW CAUSE I AM NOT OFFERING FINANCIAL ADVICE, ONLY KNOWLEDGE AS UNDERSTOOD BY ME**

But here's the thing: these particular HFs have turned the market into a game, and a very select few badasses noticed this early on, and then started playing. After much due diligence by the thousands of redditors on this sub, more and more people learned the rules, saw an opportunity, and bought shares of GameStop because they like the stock. These HFs are now counting on all of us retail investors, especially those who are playing on hard mode and don't understand the market, to cut and run and give them an out. 

**TL;DR**

These particular hedge funds have turned the market into a game. They used cheat codes all last week, and are literally banking on newer retail investors who are playing on hard mode to lose and give them an easy out. Educate yourself as much as possible on the rules and make your own personal informed decision on if you want to set sell limit orders and what that number should be. 

Again, this is not financial advice and I truly am a dummy. I've just been lucky enough to use my nephew's iPad to educate myself whenever he gets distracted, which is usually only during lunch time because Patrick loves tendies. And finally:

**STRAP THE FUCK IN AND PREPARE FOR LIFTOFF**

Title: Why an SLV squeeze will 100% not work.
First of all, let's talk gamestop: it's a very simple centralized market. buy or sell shares of the company. So far so good.

The problem with SLV is that silver IS NOT A CENTRALIZED MARKET!

The biggest silver market is COMEX, which is a futures market. See, futures markets aren't the same thing as single stock markets, they are much bigger, have more institutions rather than retail investors and they are much more complicated.

When a typical retard buys gme, they hit buy market and that's it, they now have 1 share. 

In futures, it's different. You buy contracts, these contracts are standardized and the most popular contract for silver is : SI . SI has a contract size of 5000 troy ounces!! One contract is equal to  135000 $ worth of silver. You don't need to pay 135k for a contract, you can buy it for 14k if you close the position before you need to take delivery of the silver.

Some of you might have 14k, but the risk is very high: if silver moves down 1 dollar you lose 5k.

Another problem in the silver market are the participants: goverments own silver, hedge funds own silver, investment funds own silver, too many people own too much silver!! Gamestop is at about 30 billion dollars marketcap ( and that's now ). 

The open interest on the latest SI contract is 135 960, giving it an open interest value (which admitedly is not marketcap) of 18.354.600.000 usd. 18 billion usd in just open interest. 

Open interest is how many positions are open at any given time.

Silver is a much bigger market, with more big players.

GME - there weren't so many hedge funds (poor Melvin, that was the one big hedge fund shorting gme) and so it was a subreddit against a fund, and we won.

Silver is a different story - JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Citi, hedge funds, governments, a lot more money is in silver than gme.

For these reasons, don't go into SLV, you will just play where the big boys want you to play, they have the advantage there.

tl;dr : Silver won't moon, banks have advantage, hold gme to 10k.

Title: Please check my crayon math: HF holding outstanding $GME short shares are paying $15MM in interest per day.
\~50,000,000 outstanding short shares. (current assumption, please correct my crayon scratches)  
\~30% interest rate on holding those shares.

  
50,000,000 \[shares\] \* 0.3 \[interest rate\] \* $320 \[closing price of stock\] / 365 \[days in a year\] =  $14,728,767.  
This honestly doesn't sound like 'a ton of pressure to sell' when they are standing to loose billions... Or am I missing something in my calc?  


&amp;#x200B;

Again, I have started eating my blue crayon as it tastes like gasoline smells.  All future adjustments will be made with red crayon.

Title: Listen to me: We CANNOT trust the short interest numbers this week.
First, credit to u/johnnydaggers for putting the pieces together in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/).

Many of us are probably watching the short interest % of float to indicate when the short squeeze is squoze. At this point, the hedge funds clearly know this, given how hard they've spent the last couple days using their MSM shills to announce "WE HAVE EXITED OUR SHORT POSITIONS!!! YOU WIN!"

There is a chance we're going to see that short interest % of float number go down at the same time as the price drops. Failure-to-delivers may also go down, at least in appearance.

# This is probably a lie.

Failure-to-deliver numbers and the short interest % are just the tip of the giant dildo they're trying to fuck us with. If this thing is actually what it looks like, they have way, way, *way* more exposure to this shitstorm than they are letting on.

There are ways for hedge funds and their colluding market makers to hide their exposure to a counterfeit stock scheme / naked short / short attack. You can read all about it here: [counterfeiting stock 2.0](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) (again, credit to johnny for bringing this to our attention)

If you don't know how to read, just scroll down to the picture of the iceberg.

If you **do** know how to read but don't have a lot of time, still scroll down to the picture of the iceberg, and start reading from there.

**TL: DR**\-- using a bag of dirty tricks, hedge funds can "unwind" their *disclosed* short positions, without ever having to exit their *real* short positions-- the ones that are actually super dangerous and putting them at risk of insolvency. They are going to do everything they can to get us to sell, **up to and including fucking with the disclosed short interest % of float-- the number we're all watching.**

So watch the short interest with a titanic-sized grain of salt. It could go up, it could go down, but it's likely not anywhere close to their real risk exposure either way.

My GME positions:  4 @ 329, 2 @ 325, 13 @ 272.

I originally bought in at $14 and sold at $19 like a paper-handed bitch.Now I'm holding until $10,000.

*I'm an ape, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, this is not financial advice, do your own research, etc.*

**EDIT:** if you have a lot of time on your hands and want some more research on how this works and maybe a little peek into what we're in for, see u/Sleavitt10's comment [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9jbc5/listen_to_me_we_cannot_trust_the_short_interest/glib7cs/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

**EDIT 2:** people are pointing out that that source Im using says short squeezes arent really possible anymore, because counterfeiting can overcome any amount of buy-side pressure. And normally I would agree, but there are exceptions.

Like when a counterfeiting scheme runs into a multi-million-man army of enraged retail investors who are willing to buy the stock at any price, for example. And remember, the longer this goes on, the more they lose, so they are highly motivated to produce a quick resolution. The desperate moves on Thursday and Friday that ultimately failed are proof of what a serious situation this is becoming for them.

The sheer number of retail investors who are buying this stock just to fuck up the short attack is absolutely mind boggling. So long as we maintain our numbers and resolve, they must spend more and more money to get out of the hole.

Hold. The. Line.

**EDIT 3:** [IT'S ALREADY FUCKING HAPPENING.](https://twitter.com/jonpeterswrites/status/1356019766624923654) 6 hours ago shorts weren't covering, and suddenly they've covered 30 mil on 50 mil volume? I don't fucking THINK so. And even if they are, that doesn't unwind the 2-3x as many shorts built on top of imaginary shares.

**EDIT 4:** to quote [Brought2UByAdderall](https://www.reddit.com/user/Brought2UByAdderall/), "Fuck the stats. Watch the fear."

Title: Trying to Short Squeeze Silver is a Bad Idea
First, let's jump into and talk directly about the zeitgeist.

Yes, it is heavily manipulated. Yes, there is a shortage. Yes, there is a case for the inflation adjusted price being disconnected from current market value.   Yes, it has industrial use. Yes, it's the metal on your wife's bf's cock ring.

&amp;#x200B;

You're not wrong, but theres some major issues.

It's a 1.5 Trillion dollar market cap. There is a hard case for the WSB, if acting in collusion which it shouldn't, cause that's naughty, to move silver.

Citadel, et al own a real stake in silver. Maybe deal with one issue at a time.  They would be enriched by this play, which effectively undoes doing them dirty.  Do you really wanna give them a reach around while you're savaging their red little asses?

Think about who owns the physical good.  This would cause physical silver to rocket, enriching some pretty nasty despots (both political and financial). None of this exists in a vacuum.

Every time someone has tried to mess with the silver market at scale it's blown up in their faces. Especially the Hunt brothers (Silver Thursday in 1980).  They literally lost their billion dollar family fortune in the mid 80's (from the stuff stemming from 1980)

Precious metals are a far more liquid market, with far greater trading times, and more world markets effecting price.  This means there are more players.  WSB was the David in the GME story, and won't register on the Silver market. You have COMEX &amp; LBMA.

JPM is one of the big Market Makers.  Citadel et al aren't even a blip compared to JPM.

I'm saying it's not even bringing a knife to a gun fight.  It's bringing a rubber band gun to a nuclear arms meeting.

These MF's are gonna eat all your tendies for an appetizer and want more.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, the existing DD has had very very valid points.  Silver is logically a sound investment, especially after QE Eleventy Billion.  I'm saying bleach your mind of the thought of attempting to impact the silver market.

&amp;#x200B;

Relevant positions: A few hundred ounces of physical silver. And if ya'll trying to mess with this, I'm going long on $ROPE

Title: Possible GME Capital Raise Scenarios. I think Rights/Warrants Distribution Most Likely.
**TLDR: Gamestop (the company) has not done anything since the stock surged - they've said nothing. The board's objective is to make this a long-term win. It is not to either pump the price or burn the shorts. Burning the shorts is fun for them, but not their job. A significant cash infusion via capital raise (around $1 billion or so) would increase their positive outcomes a lot. There are a few ways to do this, but I think the best is a rights dividend/warrant offering where current shareholders get warrants. This would have some unpredictable effects on the stock and possibly cause some unpredictable short-term volatility, but would ultimately reduce volatility a lot..**

*Disclaimer: Not financial/investing/tax advice. I'm not a sell-side expert and don't have investment banking experience, but if any sell-side experts give me commentary on this thread I'll integrate and credit. I probably got some details wrong. I'm short-term bullish on this stock, but have a tiny long-term put position.*

Gamestop as a business would long-term benefit from more cash right now. They have 949m of long-term debt, and a bunch of leases they'd like to cancel (and severance payments they'd have to make with those store closures to laid off employees specific to those stores). They also would like to accelerate their development of more profitable businesses (such as eCommerce, any new ideas, and the rest). Extinguishing this debt completely, ditching bad stores, and investing in growth would all make sense to an extent, even if they turn around and issue new debt (at a much lower interest rate since their financial situation will be improved).

To do this, they need to raise capital. While they could use debt, I don't think that makes sense with equity at these values. Therefore, they will try equity if they do. The three approaches that make some sense (Also the three most frequent approaches) are to do a secondary offering (similar to an IPO, which is a primary offering), do an off-the-shelf offering (which they technically can already do $100m of), or do a rights distribution.

Additionally, GME will want to regain control of their stock. Tilray's founder commented on this recently, but basically, when the stock is like this, there are a lot of side effects  - more legal risks, any options or RSUs you issue employees stop being long-term motivating, a lot of early retirements as people cash out their options, and just a huge amount of press that is unrelated to your business goals. It's not actually good for the business to have a stock this volatile.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/tilray-ceo-brendan-kennedy-issues-a-warning-to-gamestop-amc-bosses.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/tilray-ceo-brendan-kennedy-issues-a-warning-to-gamestop-amc-bosses.html)

Here is some more detail of my non-professional understanding of these fundraising methods. I think a rights distribution is most likely.

**Secondary Listing:**

This would involve them bundling a bunch of institutions and offering new shares out, just like an IPO. The problem is that to do this, they have to offer at a discount. This will enrage current shareholders. This also will allow shorts to cover more or less immediately, which also will enrage the current shareholders. I think this one is bad press all around, and I think they'd have to offer a very large discount to get institutions comfortable with doing it given the daily volatility. They also open themselves up to lawsuits, because the price is very volatile, and if GME is, for example at $100 3 weeks from now, it's an instant lawsuit. by both current and new shareholders because the losses are so large. I think this is their worst option.

**Off The Shelf Listing:**

GME already has a $100m authorization for this. I suspect (but don't know) they already used it I believe there are some timing issues here, but this is the second best option. I think there are some timing delays on being able to use it, and there may still be some legal risks I'm unaware of. Optically, I think it looks not great because it will run contrary to the fervor gripping the stock right now and be seen as giving the shorts a bit of a lifeline.

**Public Rights Distribution:**

A write-up on this in general here:

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rightsoffering.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rightsoffering.asp)

I think this is their best option. In this, they would dividend out warrants to shareholders (this is an option, except you pay the company for the share and they make a new share, instead of someone having to sell you an existing share - so it dilutes. Usually this is done as 1 warrant per X shares. So for example, they might dividend out 1 warrant for every 5 shares held. They could then set a warrant exercise price that is low compared to the current price, but obviously not lawsuit bait, such as $20. Dividending out two warrants per 3 shares long at this price would likely result in full conversion right now, and raise them $1,000,000,000 roughly in cash.  Because these ONLY go to existing shareholders, it ends up not being dilutive in the same way other offerings are - everyone can preserve their share if they put capital in - does not punish longs. **Realistically though, they'll want to issue the fewest warrants possible at the highest price they can justify and avoid danger because the more warrants they issue, the more it increases the value of puts and can create unintended consequences.**

The way this would play out is that they'd first announce the rights distribution, probably a few days to a week before. This will result in some interesting market dynamics that I'll describe in a moment.

Then, you'd get the rights distribution as a GME long. As a GME short, you'd have to SERVE UP THE RIGHTS DISTRIBUTION to the long you borrowed shares from.  Because there are a lot more longs than shares, this would have some chaos, which the market makers would have to sort out.

Then, there would be a short time during which people have to elect to exercise the warrant, which you'd be able to do through your broker They'll want this as short as possible so that the price doesn't fall below the warrant price.

Then, they clear all the warrants, and a day or two later, deliver all the shares to people.

This is their best approach I think because it gets them capital without being pain to existing longs, while also reducing their lawsuit risk compared to the others because they are just distributing a right at a low price to existing longs on equal footing, who are the ones who have standing to sue them in the first place.

I don't know how the laws would work on insiders - I think they can exercise these, but I'm sure there are a lot of details on the timing of it. They probably need to do it well ahead of q4 earnings lockup to be clean.

**Rights Market Dynamics:**

I find this very hard to predict, but this would have a few effects.

1. Upon the warrants/rights being granted (NOT declared), stock will fall in price significantly, but longs shouldn't actually lose money because they also were granted warrants. In theory, warrant value + stock value for a given number of shares (plus their granted warrants) should be the same as the prior stock price. In other words, I don't really see it as bearish or bullish.
2. You would not want to be long call options through this. Very ITM calls and calls that expire before the distribution would be largely and completely unaffected respectively, but OTM longer dated calls would get destroyed the moment this is announced. If you do have an ITM call, you will want to get out of it before the distribution by either exercising to get shares, or selling it. If you sell and are still bullish, you can then go and buy shares. Would not recommend trying to buy OTM calls after this repricing, though I guess you could.
3. Puts are the reverse. Puts that are shorter dated than the distribution don't change. Puts that are longer dated go up in price a lot even though the total value of the company didn't change.
4. You could be short through this, but it's a little annoying. Most likely, you'll be marked short the warrant, so the warrant share structure will kind of mirror the current long structure, but this has to be closed out before the exercise date, so warrants will all get called in at some point. **In a sense, it's forcing shorts to cover a good portion of their short** since the warrant will arbitrage such that the warrants granted + stocks originally held = same value as the stock alone was before. They'd have to get the cash to buy warrants on the market to deliver to people you borrowed from. Likely a bit of a mess. Would cause some short covering, alongside that call selling. Would this be more buying or selling? I don't know, the stock is super levered. I don't think it would matter a lot initially though.
5. After the distribution happens, the stock should reduce volatility after the initial price renormalization of warrants distributed + original stock = same market cap (but stock price down). This will be more the case after shares delivered. The reason the volatility reduces is that this will reduce the leverage in the stock - calls on one side, short on the other. It also eliminates the bankruptcy thesis that shorts were in on in the first place.
6. GME would regain control of their stock and be set up for a faster turn-around.

The only downside of this is it's a bit less intuitive and will require significant explaining to people. But I think it's the most fair to existing shareholders, causes the least legal risk, and puts the company in an excellent position to do their turn-around.

What I'm uncertain on is if there are weird gamma squeeze dynamics from the share price being implied to be lower after a distribution. They may want to distribute more modestly than I'm suggesting for this reason.

**Other Unknowns:**

I don't know what restrictions are on how many warrants they can toss out and if shareholder votes are required. It seems to me it's close to a stock split, so maybe none? Any investment bankers have thoughts on this - minimum price they can offer a warrant if equal distribution to all shareholders? Maximum dilution? In situations where they have to issue warrants at or above current price, this obviously would not work at all. My sense is they can be at a discount, and can dilute, but may have maximums. Anyone able to confirm who is an expert?

**Timing**

My understanding which may be incorrect is they cant do this before earnings. Their fiscal year I think ends this week? So theyd have to hurry to do this. Would not be surprised at an early earnings in order to facilitate. Early earnings is a tell that capital raise incoming.

Alright my monkeybrained buddies.

Tendietime, memes, emojis, whatever motivation you think you still need for tomorrow and the days after to just HOLD, **its actually much simpler.**

So mute your evening drawing class for a minute, chew your crayons to help you concentrate and focus on what im telling you.

We know:

**A) Shorts** [**bleed**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9dukq/its_working_melvin_capital_lost_53_in_january/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) **by holding short positions. Shorts desperately want to close positions.**

**B) To close, they have to buy stonks from us;** *saw a post earlier (help me find it?) saying we hold most of the shares.*

**C) If they buy, price goes up because we dictate the ask.**

so by easy, 2 braincell logic, whoever sells first, will automatically be the first to miss out on the tendies that follow.

Now idk about you guys, but my 3 braincells seem to only exist to make me think about what i missed out on,

&gt;"why didnt i buy earlier", "why didnt i buy more", "why did i not take out a fucking loan".

Im more okay with holding too long than too short

(fuck short anyways right?)

The essence is: what will you tell your 3 friends when they ask how much you made?

&gt;"yea nah i sold at 600 haha, i know it went to 5000 but you know that old boomer who said you cant time the market haha? now lets go celebrate at wendys i'll let you guys choose anything you want from the dollar menu haha"

Dont be that guy

Now go back drooling at your art teachers cutout, delete your limit orders and when your artificial mistress Alexa wakes you up tomorrow with the generic "I love you my lovely toilet-tiger" and your old notification to sell on market open, tell her shes not real and ask if she allows you to stay in bed for 10 more minutes

TL;DR:

As soon as you sell, it drives the price up further because shorts have to cover and buy at our ask, therefore the sooner you sell, the more potential gains you will miss out on.

Title: Schwab DD - The company who stands to gain the most out of the restriction/collusion fiasco - $SCHW
**Charles Schwab/TD Ameritrade and Fidelity/Vanguard** were the only large brokerages that did not lock out its users and allow massive market manipulation by Citadel.

$SCHW owns and operates both TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab and has the most to gain from this Citadel/market manipulation fiasco.

**Breakdown of Restrictions by Brokerage: Worst to Best**

**RobinHood: (Worst)**

\- Trading restrictions limiting purchasing power to as little as 1-5 shares on over 50 stocks

[https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys)

\- Allowing closing out of positions but banning purchasing of GME and AMC during Thursday's trading rally. (coercion with Citdael/Melvin to tank price)

\- Liquidity issues: RH is racing to raise 1$ billion from its existing investors as of Friday as many individuals are withdrawing their funds in protest of restrictions

\-Raised margin requirements on many securities

\-Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

**Interactive Brokers (garbage)**

\- Trading restrictions on GME/AMC/BB allowing closing out of positions but banning purchasing of these securities during Thursdays trading Rally. (coercion with Citdael/Melvin to tank price)

\- CEO stated in CNBC interview they imposed restrictions to help out hedge funds (and stabilize the market)

\-Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

\-Raised margin requirements on many securities

[https://www.investopedia.com/robinhood-latest-broker-to-restrict-trading-of-gamestop-and-others-5100879](https://www.investopedia.com/robinhood-latest-broker-to-restrict-trading-of-gamestop-and-others-5100879)

**WeBull + ETrade (garbage)**

\- Trading restrictions on GME/AMC/BB allowing closing out of positions but banning purchasing of these securities during Thursdays trading Rally. (coercion with Citdael/Melvin to tank price)

\-Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

\-Raised margin requirements on many securities

**Schwab/TD Ameritrade (reasonable)**

\- Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

\- Limiting short selling on volatile tickers (limiting trades with unlimited risk)

\- Raised margin requirements on many securities

\- Allowed trading of volatile securities once cash deposits were verified (many new accounts experienced this issue as new funds were not settled)

Both of these restrictions are reasonable as they have unlimited risk and are not trying to be liable for any substantial losses

**Fidelity/Vanguard (Best)**

\- Raised margin requirements on many securities

\- Limiting short selling on volatile tickers (limiting trades with unlimited risk)

Both of these restrictions are reasonable as they have unlimited risk and are not trying to be liable for any substantial losses

Thousands of upset retail investors will be fleeing RH, IBRK, Webull and Etrade over the next couple of weeks. Switching to Fidelity and Schwab/TD Ameritrade.

I would also go long Fidelity investments but it is not publicly traded.

**Schwab Analysis**

**User Growth:**

The amount of brand new retail investors opening up accounts over the past week is ridiculous. GME + AMC + BB pump has been blasted across every media station. Every online brokerage was experience server lag and strain over the past week due to the increased volume from new retail investors. Traffic on these sites were 3-4 times what they normally were during the recent trading frenzy.

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/schwab-vanguard-fidelity-suffer-service-problems-amid-trading-surge-51611773909?siteid=yhoof2](https://www.barrons.com/articles/schwab-vanguard-fidelity-suffer-service-problems-amid-trading-surge-51611773909?siteid=yhoof2)

RH/Webull/Etrade/IBRK transfers - many retail investors will be transferring over their accounts as a result of the trade restrictions and collusion with hedge funds. Listed below are the total accounts at each brokerage

RH: 13 million accounts

Etrade: 5.2 million accounts

Webull: 2 million accounts

IBRK: 700k accounts

Even if only a small portion of users switch brokerages 5-10% we are still looking at 1-2 million new accounts up for grabs between TD/Schwab/Fidelity/Vanguard

More users = more deposits/commission = more profits = stonks go up

**Reputation -** RH/Webull/Etrade/IBRK have had their app ratings and reputation destroyed thanks to reviewing bombing as a result of market collusion. These low reviews will discourage any new retail investors from using their platforms and push them towards TD/Schwab/Fidelity.

**Discount:**

$SCHW is trading at a 17% discount (as of PM on Friday) from its January high all while new retail investors and user registrations and deposits reached an all time high over the past week. Negative media coverage and market sell off this week has caused every publicly traded brokerage company to sell of from their highs. With a market rebound and new user registration data for January this stock will fly past its ATH's and run into the 70's.

**Average Daily Users**

The average daily website users has seen almost a 20% increase from the October 2020 numbers to December 2020 alone. The January numbers will even be substantially higher with TD Ameritrade and Schwab both reporting network strain due to the influx of new investors signing up last week to get into GME/AMC/BB. This trend wont be stopping anytime soon, the retail investor's strength is gaining. Just look at Wallstreetbets alone we had 2.2 million members as of Monday and now we are sitting at 7 million.

**Upcoming Earnings**

$SCHW is going to crush their upcoming earnings for Q1 2021 in April. They acquired TD Ameritrade on October 6. The amount of new retail investors has exploded over the last couple of months. Just look at last years growth in new accounts most brokerages have seen a over 100% increase in 2020 traffic. Their next earnings report for Q1 2021 will be the first quarter with 3 full months of combined revenue from both TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab. There will also be a mass exodus of upset traders fleeing Webull, Etrade and Robinhood by the thousands and transferring their assets into TD Ameritrade and Schwab.

**Future/Longevity of Brokerages:**

TD Ameritrade/Schwab will be one of the few brokerages not being slammed by class action lawsuits as a result of the manipulation today. E Trade, RobinHood, IBRK and Webull will have users fleeing in the masses to new brokerages. Do you really want to leave your money sitting on a brokerages that may have pending lawsuits against it and possible liquidity issues? (looking at you Robinhood)

**Price Target:** Bank of America just upgraded $SCHW on January 12 giving it a $68 target. Stating their has been mass growth in retail users. This was prior to the new user explosion the past 2 weeks. This stock will easily run to $70 once data comes out for January 2021 on the amount of new users and transfers.

**TLDR:** $SCHW will crush its Q1 2021 earnings thanks to an explosion in new retail investors as a result of the media coverage on GME and AMC. Retail traders on platforms that halted trading activity on Thursday will also be transferring their holdings to Schwab + TD Ameritrade. $SCHW is at a discount thanks to the market sell off and will rebound to $70+ once registration data comes out for January.

Position: 02/05/2021 &amp; 02/12/2021 $57 Calls

Calls are dirt cheap as this stock is seen as a boomer stock with low volatility.

EDIT: A few people saying TD/Schw/Fidelity were no allowing GME/BB/AMC trading. This may be a result of your cash not settling. New accounts needed their funds to settle before trading these higher volatility tickers. Any errors popping up may also be due to server strain, I was using TD and RBC in Canada and had issues finding tickers/entering into positions

EDIT 2: Schwab will be giving its winter business update on Tuesday at 11am. I expect them to discuss the massive growth in retail investors which should help this stock bounce.

EDIT 3: talked to a online agent about transferring over investments into Schwab. He mentioned that there has been more transfer requests in the last couple days then all of last quarter causing wait times/rep times to go from 5 minutes on hold to over a hour on average.

I dont like this sock 

Position: missionary usually 

I dont own any $SLV

Edit : people are getting mad Im not mentioning GME so here is your mention

Title: THE BUYING PRESSURE ON GAMESTOP WILL ACCELERATE THIS WEEK HERE IS WHY $GME
Look in the mirror. See how retarded you are?? Everyone else is also just as retarded if not more. Most opinions you read and news you hear and rumors about anything are wrong, and genuinely dumb or ill thought out. I too may very well be retarded. 

Most of the takes on Robinhood are wrong. Its a traffic jam. The same guard rails that are supposed to protect the plumbing of the system in an off ramp on the left side of the chart are slowing the system in the on ramp on the right side of the chart. You just can't open up millions of margin accounts a day trading stocks that move 300% a day. Even the most liquid brokerage quickly becomes very illiquid holding all the liable accounts. By Tuesday they will have enough liquidity and shares will have settled and retail will be able to buy en masse. Robinhood is the #1 app in the WORLD right now. This is only going to accelerate. They will get the plumbing right and add lines of credit. Credit markets are fine, so Robinhood can access capital. To the moon  

In addition, all the folks transferring accounts OUT of Robinhood cannot sell. It can take 3-5 days for a journal to clear. That is forced , which reduces the tradeable float of GameStop, increasing the short interest as a percentage of the float. 

We will see more buying pressure this week, forced holding by transfers, more institutional buying, and algorithms from quant funds like Renaissance Technologies analyzing everyones autistic thoughts, and following!!

IM AN INTERNET RETARD DONT TAKE MY ADVICE

TLDR: I really think the stock and think the squeeze continues and accelerates this week $GME 

Title: Some non-GME broad market DD
Listen up. I just got off a conference call with all your wives' boyfriends and I got some DD to drop on you. Everyone here knows about the big four stocks right now. If not, GTFO.

What Im here to tell is to not focus 100% on these four and let other great opportunities pass you by. (Note  What I am NOT TELLING YOU is to sell your GME. Hodor that sh\*t). While you all have been foaming at he mouth over your GME games, youve likely missed what is going on with the rest of the market. Several great performing stocks have been dumping since this GME craze began. Oh, need examples?  To name a few you may have heard of: 

AAPL  Down 5.11% 

AMD  Down 7.7% 

BIDU  Down 7%

DOCU  Down 8.7%

F  Down 8.6%

PINS  Down 6.25%

NIO - down 8%

Wondering why this may be? Two theories They both might be right, or I might have a really smooth brain. 

1) These hedge funds everyone here is so keen on financially ruining need to cover their losses somehow. What better way than to liquidate stocks that have had crazy runs the last few months.  If this is true it will be extra enjoyable to watch them pay more to re-enter these positions when the stocks inevitably bounce back.

2) You people selling your shares in other stuff to buy more GME. (again, great job holding the line) I have seen several posts on here from other smooth brains selling their shares of some of those listed here. I applaud your enthusiasm for the cause and wish you the best. 

With these two combined, you end up with tons of shares dumping from these 401K stocks, with the buyers foaming at the mouth for more GME, NOK, AMC, BB. 

Once this is all over and the world of normies forget all about the GME madness, they are going to put their money back into their boomer stocks and standard 401K stocks. What does this mean for you? Dont miss the dips happening all around you while the world is focused on 4 stocks and a shiba inu. If you have any extra money and cant afford GME, check out the rest of the market for buying opportunities. 

TLDR  Keep holding the line! If you have any money left, buy the dips on others for bonus tendies

(This is not financial advice)

Edit - added NIO.

Title: I know that we LOVE $AMC and $GME, but why can't we HATE a stock. I might have an AMAZING short opportunity.
FULL DISCLAIMER

I am a fucking retard so my math is probably wrong, but if its not it proves that $DB is MASSIVELY overvalued and presents an enormous short opportunity for retail investors like ourselves. Also, it just happens to screw over one of the most evil and corrupt banks in the United States, if not the world. (They also have more than 300B in Debt)

Overshadowed by the recent infinite money glitch known as $GME and $AMC, $DB experienced THREE gigantic scandals in one week.

1. [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-regulators-press-deutsche-bank-090221050.html?.tsrc=rss](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-regulators-press-deutsche-bank-090221050.html?.tsrc=rss)
2. [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investigation-alert-schall-law-firm-203700682.html?.tsrc=rss](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investigation-alert-schall-law-firm-203700682.html?.tsrc=rss)
3. [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholder-alert-deutsche-bank-aktiengesellschaft-195000739.html?.tsrc=rss](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholder-alert-deutsche-bank-aktiengesellschaft-195000739.html?.tsrc=rss)

Now that we are aware of the fraudulent and scammy work conducted by these assholes, lets analyze their share price.

**Current Share Price:** 10.12

**Historical (12 Month) Earnings Per Share:** \-0.89 (0.1 Q3 2020)

**Annual Sales:** 28.9B

**Annual Dividend per Share:** 0.10

**Historical Price/Earnings (Median):** 16.70

**Book Value Per Share:** 0.2939

([https://smallbusiness.chron.com/calculate-companys-stock-price-21802.html](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/calculate-companys-stock-price-21802.html))

I used two of the formulas presented in the above article Benjamin Graham &amp; P/E Ratio (Intrinsic Value)

1. Projected Price using Benjamin Graham Formula

1a. SQR ((15)(1.5)(.1)(0.2939)) = 0.81 (actual value per share)

2. P/E Ratio (Intrinsic Value)

2a. ((16.70)(0.1)) = 1.67 (intrinsic value)

&amp;#x200B;

This means the actual *value* of the stock is *Drumroll Please...*

Between  $0.81 - $1.67

&amp;#x200B;

If my math is correct (and it probably isn't), then this means that Deutsche Bank's stock is MASSIVELY overvalued and is due for a market correction (hence the AMAZING shorting opportunity). Also, if I am wrong please correct me - I only would like to learn more about the market, so I can eventually lose $5,000,000 in an earnings call.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Current Price = 10.12

&amp;#x200B;

I do not want to mess up the momentum of $GME or $AMC, I am only posting this because in the same way that we LIKE those stocks, I think we should also be open to DISLIKING some of the worst stocks on the market. Especially stocks with ties to CNBC and the other hedge fund assholes who have enslaved us with debt.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Full Disclosure: I do not have access to margin with my brokerage therefore limiting my ability to make this trade. I also lack the capital to do so. This post is not intended to be financial advice, rather an analysis of current market conditions.\*

TLDR:

Assholes at big bank fucked over world economy, and now these shitheads have too much debt. 

My positions are:

Ten shares of $AMC @ an avg price of 13.40

40 shares of some crappy penny stock (Frontier Comm.) @ $0.24

Two shares of NOK purchased @ $6.89

Title: NVAX Part II: Outlook Beyond the Fortnight
I tried to [tell](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l22qez/nvax_a_fortnight_bottlenecks_and_imminent/) you all a week ago what was coming. I had my first 6 figure day in the market on Friday when NVAX went from 134 to 235 overnight after reporting great efficacy data. My weeklies were up 9000%, it was incredible. I want to send a thank you to u/Upstairs_Speech for his posts in the past, I would not have thought of the trade if it was not for him.

Now before you all tell me "I wish I saw this before the stock went up 70%" let me explain to you why this is still early innings. Sure, this might not be as sexy of a trade as round 1 was, but now that data concerns are off the table this thesis has a lot less risk. This one is more of a low risk, high growth play as opposed to a get rich quick one.

Let's do a mental exercise:

The day is December 31, 2020, everyone is excited to be moving on to 2021. NVAX share price hovers at $110, a $7B market cap awaiting UK phase 3 efficacy data. There are real concerns as to whether NVAX actually has a vaccine that works given their prior 30 years of failures. The market prices this risk accordingly and NVAX's market cap is only **17%** that of MRNA.

Fast forward 4 weeks. NVAX has released data on 20,000 patients, shows the highest efficacy of any vaccine against wild type COVID. NVAX shows strong efficacy against UK strain which no one else has. They show that the South Africa strain is a real concern with efficacy at 60%, and there is 0 reason to believe any vaccine will perform better against that strain. 

And I can't overstate this part enough, the **really** important detail here is that NVAX is the only protein vaccine on the horizon. The only other protein vaccine coming any time soon is MAYBE GSK/Sanofi and they already showed terrible data. They blamed it on dosing but there are major question marks there and they are delayed 6 months minimum. The reason protein vaccines are important is because they are the only ones that can offer coverage against multiple strains in a single shot. This is how the flu shot is done (which NVAX just passed phase 3 of in March). The flu shot is a protein vaccine that covers 4 strains in a single shot. What is becoming very clear is that we are going to need the same for COVID. The future of COVID vaccines is that in your annual shot you get coverage against wild type, SA strain and Brazil strain for example. NVAX is the **only** company that can do this right now. RNA vaccines are too reactive to handle multiple strains. You can already see how many symptoms people get with the current vaccine.

This [thread](https://twitter.com/PeterKolchinsky/status/1354929042965864451?s=20) is gold and helped me to understand the situation.

The market clearly has not digested this sufficiently yet. How do I know? Let's go back to the exercise from the beginning. Given NVAX's advancements in the last 4 weeks their market cap has doubled, up to 14B. What do you think Moderna has done in that same time frame when their COVID platform continues to weaken? Up 5%? 10%? 20%? They are up 67% in that same time frame! After everything that has happened NVAX still only has **20%** the market cap of MRNA. It basically hasn't even caught up. The reporting from mainstream media on NVAX was an abomination, especially compared to how they covered J&amp;J's bad data. The truth will emerge. The market will realize it and will see NVAX is still deeply undervalued.

I am obviously not saying that NVAX will inevitably be as valuable or more valuable than MRNA. MRNA technology is very valuable and they are an extremely ambitious company. BUT, NVAX is about to play catch up due to the glaring discrepancy. In addition to COVID don't forget that NVAX has an incredible flu shot, likely at some point to be the first RSV vaccine ever and their Matrix M adjuvant is now very valuable. Quick recap of differences between the two vaccines:

https://preview.redd.it/diljgsjmxoe61.png?width=425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a0e94718b1185709f44d2de968aec6e566c4aa6

My belief is that NVAX gets to a 20B market cap very soon (50% upside) and I can't imagine a world in which its not at 30B minimum by year end (100% upside). Upcoming catalysts are finalizing 200M dose deal with EU, emergency use authorization in the UK and other countries will quickly follow, production partnership with Merck or GSK/Sanofi and others.

IMO this week will be very telling, if it is up on Monday buy and don't think twice. If it pulls back maybe give it a couple days to get a better price on options as it might consolidate for a while.

**Positions:**

75% allocated to 1/21/22 280 calls. If it gets to 30B market cap by expiration its over a 300% return and I think market cap gets there by end of summer so it would be even more profitable. Don't mess with the July calls at this point, they are too expensive. You basically get the same value and more time going with next January. IMO this one is free money.

25% allocated to 4/16/21 240 calls. If it gets to 20B market cap by expiration this is a 150% return. I think there is a somewhat decent chance it could be there by the end of this week but we will see.

Title: $BANG (BB, AMC, NOK, GME) Options Volume Analysis
&amp;#x200B;

[Top 15 Options Activity from Friday \(1\/29\/2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/50atl3uc1pe61.png?width=1373&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e0b4faeda15be0c6e6cf70d0dff3a1bd9d01b0a)

Due to the exponential increase in membership in WSB I have started to see a lot of misinformation, favoritism, and overall divisiveness going on within the community. I decided to do my own Due Diligence (DD) to determine which stocks I will be holding next week, and hopefully this can start up a meaningful conversation in the comment section to help out our new friends who mostly want to know what to invest in.  I pulled the top 15 stocks with the greatest Options Volume from Friday (1/29). You can see all 4 of the $BANG stocks make this list. Despite understanding that GME is a heavily shorted stock with a Short Float greater than 100%, it is important to look at the Put Volume as well. This is the numbers of option contracts that are shorting the stock. GameStop is the only company of the batch that has a Short Float of greater than 100%, which is why this short squeeze is working so well, but its also the most heavily shorted on the options side. I think its important to see all 4 of the BANG stocks are heavily shorted on the put side too. If you look up who is buying these Put Contracts, it is mostly big institutional investors, whose best interest is to artificially depress the stock price so their puts pay out (look at what happened to BB and NOK on Thursday and Friday). This is why we have to stand together as a community and embrace the $BANG index that we created.

**GME** \- This is a short squeeze. Not much to say here. Buy, hold, dont sell.

**BB** \- This is a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze. 66% of the float (shares available) are owned by institutional investors, so while the float might seem big (550M), we are only dealing with 34% of the shares. Buy, hold, dont sell.

**AMC** \- Also a short squeeze. The Short float isnt above 100% but this is still a great potential candidate.

**NOK** \- This is a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze. This is the weirdest one to me because everyone was claiming this was bot propaganda last week and then has the 3rd highest option volume on Friday. Not sure how to feel about this one, but hey its popular.

**Defining some terms:**

**Short Float:** Percentage of shorted shares in relation to the total number of floated shares (shares available to be traded)

**Options Volume:** Total number of **option** contracts bought and sold for the day

**% Put:** Percentage of total option contracts that are puts (think the stock will go down)

**% Call:** Percentage of total option contracts that are calls (think the stock will go up)

**Put/Call Ratio:** Ratio of puts to calls option contracts (higher the ratio, higher the short %)

Title: NOK, NOK hear me out for a sec.
I do not want to detract from GME, AMC, or even BB.  
I am not a BOT Beep Boop 001111001  
Positions or Ban: 9.1k Shares, will add along the way.

I keep seeing posts saying NOK doesnt have enough shorts to move the stock or theres too many shares to even get it to budge. I dont know where all this loser mentality came from. So Im going to try to convince you otherwise with simple DD and pretty colors (This is my first DD postever). This is better than half the shills do out there going haha NOK NOK go Brrrr

Im a smooth brain fuck but even I can see on January 27th bulls moved the stock to $8.83 from $5.87 a change of over 50%. FFS, if thats not moving the stock I dont know what is. Does that sound like an unmovable object?

There are a couple reasons we came down from that high so quickly, retail/institutional shorts were crawling all over this thing and the next day we were RESTRICTED from buying. I think theres a lot more shorts on this than previously anticipated. Diamond hands are needed here as well as access to the open markets owe can buy and hold.

Volume is trending upwards recently as well. With a record setting day on the 27th.

If we take a look at three charts below you can see a similar pattern. All three are great stocks. All three are down from all time highs. Except one hasnt been woken up yet.

Look, I cant do the level of DD some other people do on here and others have done a great job pointing out the positives, so Im not going to beat a dead horse. All I know is NOK is sitting near multi-year lows (like some other famous stocks were recently), its volume is picking up immensely (like some other famous stocks recently), its based in nostalgia(just like some of the stocks that went up recently) and its getting a lot of publicity which makes my pants feel kind of tight.

It has not yet popped, not even in the slightest. Dont just cast it out of your mind because you think its worthless. Thats the same shit people did to GME when u/deepfuckingvalue mentioned it a year ago. Now those same people are eating crow while hes bathing in fucking tendies. Will this be the same as GME? No, GME was a special catalyst. Could NOK double or quadruple in a year? Yes, absolutely. Isn't that worth a look?

Title: GME share price moving forward after the shorts squozed
Hi all, im providing my opinion on the subject matter as i have been hearing chatter about share prices crashing back to $4 or $20 once the squoze is over.

I am of the opinion this will not happen as we need to look at companies which successfully battled Shorters as reference- best one is Tesla TSLA:

a. We all know why GME price , due to gamma squeeze from calls, buying of stocks and shorts covering - all these led to stocks being bought from float. So less supply and more demand = price go up bigly

b. Important to remember who are the parties benefiting from  - retail, whales and institutions who long shares and calls, and GME insiders

c. The manipulative actions of brokers to limit share buying by retail - share buy limit 1 - 5 shares and increasing margin to 100%, these are actually good for holders. Why you ask? Because that means retail buyers who have 100% cash to back their holdings can hold onto these shares without worry about having stop losses or increase margin requirements.

So with these 3 points once share price rocket and settled (assuming at $1000 to 1200), there will be some selling to recognise profits. But the price will not crater because simple reason, at that price GME has the capital to reinvent their biz - means more incentive for whales and institutions to hold as a value stock. Retail will mostly likely hold.

When selling takes place it will also be controlled, because people are not selling to get out of a sinking ship, but to make a profit. Look at TSLA do you see its price cratering because holders are dumping desperately? Buyers who got in later this week bought the shares between $200 to $300 on average, there is no reason to sell at massive loss once price  

Sorry for rambling im using all my powers from 2 hour sleep. Pls fuck me up if my monke  brain anal ysis is wrong.

This not finance advice.

Title: Diamond hands not enough. GME Price Surge -&gt; Gamma Squeeze -&gt; MOASS
Good morning fellow degens,

GME has already changed my life more than I could have imagined and I know that's true for many of you. But I'm not selling yet!

I want to see this thing through so I'm diamond handing my remaining 1000 shares. However, I came to the realization that **diamond hands may not be enough**.

Let's review where we're at, but let's do something to make it a bit more interesting. For those aspects we're not certain of, let's assume the *worst case* for gme retail. This is a helpful way to think through risks generally so why not apply it here? Let's go.

**Assuming Worst Case for Retail**


*All shorts are new shorts*

* Did Melvin and Shitron cover? Let's assume they weren't lying when they say they closed their short positions.
* But let's take that idea further and assume ALL existing shorts are NEW shorts. Remember, we're talking worst case.
* Shorts entered when the price was at recent highs so the pressure on them is not as extreme as previously thought. 
* Borrow costs would have been high but hedgies would have planned for that. 
* This means new shorts who bought high are intending to hold until retail eventually folds. They're prepared for a longer game.

*Gamma squeeze sqouze*

* There was no major benefit to closing above 320 Friday. We could argue about naked calls but we're assuming worst case here.
* The gamma squeeze already occurred earlier in the week when the price jumped over 320 forcing MMs to delta hedge open call contracts by purchasing additional shares. 
* This DID cause a price spike earlier in the week (remember we touched 500 at one point?). That was the gamma squeeze. Then RobinHood threw cold water on the party.
* I misunderstood gamma squeeze's and posted some incorrect info in my earlier comments. Ouch. Sorry!. I've gone back and edited those. For great info on why the gamma squeeze already sqouze check out /u/BlueEstee's [post](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8e9f3/read_this_if_you_expected_a_huge_gamma_squeeze/).

*Whales are big for a reason*

* I am suspicious of anyone who suddenly calls me a friend after my portfolio jumps in value. Aren't you?
* So let's assume that the whales who were hoovering up shares from the hedgies' ladder attacks are NOT retail's friend.
* Check out /u/jkn_k's [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/) in /r/investing  (I know, I know) which goes into great detail about how whales bought dips but those dips were still way above analysts' evaluations of gme, i.e. they still paid a LOT like in the 100-200s I'd guess.
* So we can assume whales share a near-term interest with retail - both want the share price to go up.
* But after that? Who knows? I'm sure whales won't want to hold any bags (remember they got big by feeding on smaller fish).

**What If? Worst possible future for retail**

Here's how this could play out poorly for retail:

* Retail mania drives the stock price up higher but not *too* high.
* Whales unload their shares to retail at higher prices and exit.
* Brokers either further restrict trading or some other obstacle prevents retail from driving the share price higher.
* Shorts hold and out wait retail. Retail loses interest or a black swan event occurs. There is no MOASS.
* The share price falls and retail take massive losses.
* Game over. :(


**What If? Gamma Squeeze Triggers MOASS**

* Going to the moon takes rocket fuel and that's where the gamma squeeze comes into play.
* Massive upwards momentum early in the week should trigger another gamma squeeze. 
* A gamma squeeze may force the shorts to have to cover and lead to the MOASS. 
* Remember a gamma squeeze occurs when the price goes up quickly forcing MMs to buy shares to delta hedge open call contracts.
* This occurred last week when we passed 320 which was the highest available strike.
* The highest available strike this coming week? I see a 800 strike in TastyTrade. Do we have to hit 800? No idea. Maybe someone with more wrinkles can tell us?


I want to give credit where credit is due here: /u/Pyr0smurf's posted some great DD on this to /r/options because it looks like they're banned atm from /wsb. Anyways - they make this [same case with charts here](https://old.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l8w7z3/currently_banned_from_posting_in_wsb_but_this_is/)!


**Why I'm Bullish on the Gamma Squeeze Next Week**

* It's in the whales best interest to see the price goes up to, so retail has professional re-reinforcements
* We have several possible Great Men of History - Cohen, Musk, Chamath - who may either buy shares or announce news that shoots things skyward leading to the gamma squeeze
* Retail interest is INSANE. Billboards? I love you guys. That is incredible. 
* Worldwide interest? Really?! Beautiful stuff. Hats off to europoors and other brothers and sisters around the world as well - much love for holding the line.

**tl;dr** 

**HODLing may NOT be enough to trigger the MOASS. Buy gme, buy gme, buy gme!**





Positions: 1000 shares of gme

This not investment advice. And I'm not suggesting anyone make any actual moves or listen to me in anyway. Look at my past plays. Most of them are terrible. I somehow lost money on the Vegas play over the summer and I've lost money on TSLA more times than I like to think about. I bought BABA right before the ANT IPO didn't happen - then doubled down (that may work out yet though). Anyways - this is all for entertainment purposes!

EDIT: Added emojis heh

Title: GME - Bullish Pennant - This will go much higher before it goes lower! - UPDATE
GME is in a classic Bullish Pennant pattern now.  

[Bullish Pennant](https://preview.redd.it/fz5r3pxuyne61.png?width=1127&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85df87c606855a93a07a90ac07845695b4456780)

The bullish pennant is one of the basic patterns traders learn to recognize when they start trading.

Looking at all the technical indicators of this chart GME should be ready to move higher by roughly the same length as the previous rally before the consolidation happened (the triangle shape is the consolidation).

If the plot that on the chart we end up at $933 for the next peak, so yeah $1000 is probably really not a meme, its fucking possible for sure.  

[someone else drew this chart I just borrowed it](https://preview.redd.it/0c4vxzwtyne61.jpg?width=1468&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=603b3300fc0beb195114711f127bfa0728c59fe0)

Of course it only happens if enough people buy the stock on monday, but with 7.3 mil degenerates on WSB and the entire world hearing about GME for a straight week in the news, smart and dumb money will flow into this stock on monday.  

Meanwhile the SPx, SPY, QQQ, are all looking super bearish, and ready to do a steep correction, so probably GME is one of the only safe stocks out there to invest in right now. The rest is all a short!!!! This has been brewing for a couple of months, and many respectable hedge funds indicated end of december they expected a -10% correction on the broader markets in Q1 2021. That means tech, and finance, and everything will go down (which has been already happening last week).

This is not financial advice or any kind of advice, this is just one autistic degenerate talking to himself. I WOULD NO NOT BUY THIS STOCK, it's highly volatile. It might cost you all your investment.

That being said, it did buy this stock again on friday and I have been feeling sick all weekend. If you can handle the stomach churning and dizzying swings you probably are just as autistic as I am, and this is a great stock for such retarded degenerates who want to prove their manhood in other ways than banging their girlfriends sister. 

****  ****

EDIT:

1. To those thinking I predict 933 as the top with this post, no that is not what I am saying, I just think that's a possible next rally, and 933 could be where the next consolidation happens, but maybe this could go much higher. Also you all peer pressured me into holding till I die, so I guess I will never make bank on this one.
2. To those saying TA does not apply here, I believe TA always applies anywhere, but TA is only 20% of trading analysis, the rest is fundamentals....oh wait you are saying fundamentals went out the window in 2020? ..... so yeah, this is just 20% of analysis the rest is I DUNNO WHATEVER, WELL SEE, still better than the casino's.
3. I got many questions where to find charts like this, it can be found on tradingview dot com website where many traders share charts and ideas.
4. probably this is a retarded analysis, I told you I am a total degenerate autist, don't get worked up about it, print it and wipe your ass with it for all I care, put dont bash me, jezus, you really would bash an autist retard? what kind of human being are you?

edit 2: added the rockets  

edit 3: added the diamond hands  ****  ****

**anyways, nevermind all that stuff I said above, if there are still shorts who need to cover maybe this willl go to 2K instead or 3K, who knows at this point anything about anything? I certainly know one thing, and that is that I know nothing.**

Title: Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) delayed competitor Novavax (NVAX) coronavirus vaccine efficacy trial in the U.S., which just proved to be the most effective vaccine in overseas trials.... oh and Robinhood banned you from buying NVAX the other day when this stock went to the moon.
Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) strong-armed Novavax (NVAX) out of a manufacturing agreement with Emergent BioSolutions (EBS). Thereby delaying Novavax's Phase 3 efficacy trial in the U.S., which just proved to be the best COVID-19 vaccine candidate in overseas trials. So now instead of manufacturing the best coronavirus vaccine, Emergent is making product for money grabbing bureaucrats... oh and Robinhood  banned its users from buying stock in Novavax the other day.  


**Novavax:**

* 96% effective at preventing infection from Wuhan Covid-19 and 100% protection from severe disease.
* 85% effective at preventing infection from UK variant and 100% protection from severe disease.
* *Above combine to 89.3% prevention in UK trial.*
* 60% effective at preventing infection from SA variant.

**Johnson &amp; Johnson:**

* 66 - 72%  effective at protecting from moderate to severe disease from Wuhan covid and 85% protection from severe disease.
* UK variant protection unknown.
* 57% effective at protecting from moderate to severe disease in SA variant.

Title: GrowthGeneration - A long investment
Hi guys

First I want to clarify that I own stocks in Growthgeneration (GRWG). 

GRWG has been able to utilize their potential over the past couple of years and managed to increase their revenue by more than 100% 3 years in a row. This year seems like it'll proceed where it left off from 2020. Their next quarterly report will land in the middle of March. A proper result with more than 20% revenue increase will get the stock to proceed on its great journey. 

The stock has gone from $4,x to $43 in one year. If they manage to continue their growth, I see no reason for why the stock won't be able to triple over the next year. If anyone has any inputs on what might be able to slow down their growth, feel free to reach out. I'd be happy to listen to a different perspective on this stock.

Title: DD about Melvin closing their position 
TLDR: Looks like Melvin did close their position, but it wouldnt affect the squeeze.


DD:

I dug up Melvin SEC filing and saw that they have 5.4M GME shares put in Sep (an increase from 3.4M shares in June) https://sec.report/Document/0000905718-20-001111/
Most likely their short position is around the same or up to 7M in December, but I doubt they have a much larger position than that.


Melvin claimed that they covered their shorts on 01/27. GMEs price on 01/27 is ~$360, so it cost them about $2B to $2.5B to cover. This matches the bail they got from Citadel. Also LB, one of Melvins top holdings had a violent dip on 01/27 - this could mean Melvin had to liquidate some other positions to cover. Melvin has another SEC Filing due Feb 14 for December, so we will have a better idea about their number.


S3 reports that short interest reduced by 5M shares https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194252674953219?s=21 on 01/27. This matches with the shares Melvin covered.


This means there are still 58M shares that are not yet covered. What we are seeing in the last couple days are the tip of the iceberg, the squeeze will be much more violent in the next couple days if we  

I dont think that many of these are new short positions because:
1. Shares are incredibly hard to borrow at this moment
2. Hedge funds tend to target low risk high ROI stocks. This means easy/cheap to short shares with negative sentimental


Bottom line: hold on tight  because were gonna go for quite a ride  
My price target: $20k

Not a financial advice, just why I like the stock.

Title: The real reason Wall Street is terrified of the GME situation
I have been following GME since mid-September and over that time I have banked myself a %1300 return in the process. However, the whole time I was a little puzzled with how severe the reactions from Wall Street have been, especially this week. "The company had more than 100% of its stock sold short! That's never happened before!", you say. I know, I know, but that's [not actually not a new thing](https://www.forbes.com/2006/08/25/naked-shorts-global-links-cx_lm_0825naked.html?sh=f59ff078400b). A short squeeze, even one of this magnitude, should have squoze by now with GME up more than 10x in the span of weeks. Something is just not right. **I think there is something much, much bigger going on here. Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**

Here is my hypothesis: I think the hedge funds, clearing houses, and DTC executed a coordinated effort to put Game Stop out of business by conspiring to create a gargantuan number of counterfeit shares of GME, possibly 100-200% or more of the shares originally issued by Game Stop. In the process, they may have accidentally created a bomb that could blow up the entire system as we know it and we're seeing their efforts to cover this up unfold now. What is that bomb? **I believe retail investors may more than 100% of GME** (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company). This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

For you to follow this argument, you need to go read the white paper ["Counterfeiting Stock 2.0"](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) so you understand how the hedge funds can create fake stock out of thin air and disguise it so it looks like real shares. They use these fake shares in [short attacks to drive the price of a company down until they put them into bankruptcy](https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack?amp_js_v=a6&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D). This practice seems to be widespread among hedge funds that go short. There is even a term for it, "strategic failstodeliver." Counterfeiting shares is extremely illegal (similar level to counterfeiting money) but it's very difficult to prove and even getting the court to approve subpoenas because of the way the financial industry has stacked the deck against investigations.

This completely explains why so many levels of the financial system seem to be actively trying to get in the way of retail investors purchasing more GME. It's not just about a short squeeze, it's about their firms' very existence and their own personal freedom. We have the opportunity to put all these people in jail by proving that we own more than 100% of shares in existence.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via [13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme) that they own more than **102,000,000 shares** (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen). Now, I don't know the delay/variance on these ownership numbers, but I think there is a pretty solid argument that close to 100% of GME is owned by these firms, if not more. 

Moreover, there are now more than 7 million people subscribed to r/wallstreetbets. I know lots of people here are sitting on a few hundred shares that they bought back when it was under $50. Some of us are even holding thousands. If the average number of shares owned by each subscriber is even close to 5-10, we have a very good shot at also owning a similarly enormous amount of GME. E**ven if the average was just 3 shares per subscriber, that puts the minimum retail position at about 30-50% of the entire company.**

GME has been on the NYSE threshold list for almost a month. We don't have January data yet, but I just analyzed the data from the [SEC's failstodeliver list for December](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) (all 65,871 lines of it) and totaled up the number of shares that were essentially clearly counterfeit. For comparison, I did the same for a couple random tickers. Most companies have close to no shares not show up. Of those that do, it's a relatively small number of shares. For example, two random companies: Lowes ($LOW, \~$125B market cap) had a total of 25,613 shares fail to be delivered, Boston Beer Company ($SAM, $11.5B market cap) had 368 shares fail to be deliver. 

How many shares of GME failed to deliver? **5,969,693**. *Almost 10% of GameStop's float did not settle in December*. How bad do you think that number will be when we get the numbers for January? I'm willing to bet its many times that. Look at how that compares to other companies' stock: 

[Histogram showing number of shares that weren't delivered in December \(x-axis\) vs the number of companies that fall into that bin \(y-axis\). GME is an extreme outlier.](https://preview.redd.it/462bbnphjme61.jpg?width=403&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a0691283f02268b80135dab1de856db182d0091)

I think this explains all the shenanigans going on the last few days. There is way too much counterfeit GME stock out there and DTC, the clearing houses, and the hedge funds are all in on it. That's why there has been such a coordinated effort to disrupt our ability to buy shares. No real shares can be found **and it's about to cause the system to fall apart.** 

*TLDR; We probably own way more of GME than we think and that is freaking out Wall Street because it could prove they've been up to some extremely illegal shit and the whole system could implode as a result.*

Title: Small TA on GME and why there is STRONG evidence of an upward spike. Just a retard sharing his opinon. BUY AND HOLD GME, it's NOT too late! 
 

https://preview.redd.it/jjikwgkgjme61.png?width=2181&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d23a5e97f3d43f7df034a7aff0a8ddcc4610bd2b

Hello degenerates,

I'm retarded and just looking for second opinions but...

Doing a quick TA on the GME chart from the past week and using a squeeze momentum indicator plus the basic RSI, I'd conclude:

1. Black crosses on the SQZMOM mean it's compressed. Looking at a previous cycle of compression, it was just when the price took off. I bought 64@43.91 so basically when it started.
2. The current compression is quite a big one, lasting a few days. The previous compression timeline looked at a pretty long sideways trend but the difference now is the spikes. It can't go sideways too long. But, if it's so compressed it means there is a pretty fucking huge possibility of having another run like we had from the 40 to the 480 range on the graph.
3. RSI seems to support this too. We are below the normal trendline of the past week. Last time it happened to move up, it was during the 40 to 480 spike. RSI seems to be moving up.
4. Volumes have been LOW as FUCK for obvious reasons (FUCK RH and the blatant manipulation). Hope you retards managed to get into good platforms so you can start buying.
5. The pattern usually warns of a big downward or upward movement of the stock. Based on the RSI and SQZMOM, it looks to be even stronger evidence of a huge spike.

I'm 110% sure there are much better, more knowledgeable people out here. I don't think I'm good or bad. I'd love to hear second opinions here and if what I say is complete shit I will delete the post so people won't be misinformed. Or I'll try to update it if it is possible.

Also, sorry if the flair is incorrect or something.  Post may be too short for DD.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR;

Hope you bought the last dip because next stop is the fucking moon.

If you didn't buy yet, there's nothing wrong with hopping on while we ride parabolically. You think 10-20% gains on a single day is bad? Fuck no.

What about 100%+?

WHAT ABOUT 1000%?

Don't miss out and don't paper hand like most did during this run. Are you that dumb to miss out on a historic moment? Can't you make money OFF ONE OF THE BIGGEST RUNS IN A SINGLE STOCK?

GME 

Title: Logic to explain why GME is the ONE and ONLY squeeze 
Short interest is still over 100% and the borrow rate is over 30% assuming shares are available and being lent out. If they are being lent out, then that would be an annualized interest rate of over 100%. Insanity. 

So as a short seller if you borrow $100 and have to pay $3 a day in interest. You are eventually going to pay your debt, especially with undefined risk / margin exposure and the media blasting this story against your position every day.

I am a full time day trader (futures / options / stocks) and not a financial advisor, I have been trading markets since I was 16, I am 32 now. I have NEVER seen anything like this, and most likely never will again. DO NOT TAKE ANYTHING I SAY AS ADVICE, DO YOUR OWN FUCKING RESEARCH AND DILIGENCE. DO NOT TAKE THIS INFORMATION AS A RECOMMENDATION TO DO ANYTHING WITH YOUR MONEY.

0) There is nothing in the market that has a short interest higher than the number of shares available to trade. 

1) New shorts will enter the market and try to drive the price down back to fundamentals (you can almost guarantee this, everyone thinks they are a genius and can time the market to perfection - especially now)

2) New and old shorts will eventually cover their positions (gotta keep track of the time to cover)

3) if nobody offers their shares for sale, then in theory the hedge funds will bleed out paying over 30%+ interest EVERY DAY and eventually pay whatever the ask is or go bankrupt. (The real squeeze)

4) If no shares are available to cover their shorts whatsoever, then the clearing house that is responsible for actually holding these shares/capital will now be in the spotlight. (Why RH had to restrict trading or go broke)

5) synthetic long positions (short put / long call / long/short vol) cannot help the shorts in the long run. They can reduce their losses with them but they cannot escape this squeeze without actually delivering shares back or bringing their losses down to a maintainable level and still pay interest)

6) /u/DeepFuckingValue .... The man clearly has asteroids for balls. 


Here are some possible things that GameStop can do to capitalize on this madness, and some things that can go wrong. Again, I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR, DO YOUR OWN DAMN RESEARCH.

1) Buyback their shares in the open market (This will reduce the amount of shares available to trade and FUCK over the short sellers who wanted to drive this company to the ground and feed off of its corpse like a pack of hyenas)

2) Offer new shares for sale (they can raise new money to grow the company / change fundamentals but this will help the shorts who can buy them up and cover their short positions)

3) Long squeeze. The exact opposite of a short squeeze can happen, highly unlikely given the current circumstances. Fuck these guys. 

4) They can trade back and forth between each other, their partners and their sister companies technically keeping the price within a specific maintainable range they can leverage to close out their short positions whenever someone really trys to sell. (This is why people around here have theories why its important to hold)

Title: I've been trading Silver futures August. Don't fall for their shit by listening to your doomer uncle finally
Background: I've been trading silver futures since August which makes me essentially the expert. I joke but not really.

SILVER: the world's fakest precious commodity. As we are poor people here most of us grew up with the perception that silver has value due to its scarcity. No longer is this the case. Base usage statistics state that about 70% of it is used in the industrial manufacturing sector.

Countries hold many tons of reserves. Just Google silver resolves and understand Peru is sitting on a many year stockpile if all of the aggregate demand suddenly decided to only buy from Peru.  As price rises poor countries will inevitably sell off reserves and there is a strong suspicion has been occurring as silver is up big time this year and tax revenues for all nations are down.

So the ETF SLV is a complete crock of shit. End of week I figure out the max pain option price and just sell a call/put based on it as SLV is determined by the futures price, which is heavily controlled through a large amount of paper contracts on both sides of buy/sell that'll never materialize.  If you go through my post history you'll see me shorting silver this summer and while very profitable, I did blow a bunch per wsb lifestyle, but my day to day futures trading gave me tremendous feel for the pulse of it. End of week is beyond manipulated and while I do not have the software to do so; if you threw it in on your computer to short/long slv/silver futures towards its equivalent SLV max pain price (with the caveat of factoring in only the most recent 30 days max pain which is tough to generate except through watching OI/volumes fluctuate) you'd join in on the JPMorgan train as they're the ones doing it. I'd actually argue instead of taking a buy and hold approach to just do exactly that by end of day Thursday as JPMorgan acts like a crooked circus game operator with "wild" Friday swings towards max pain or lack of expected shifts (that then materialize monday) so every person who plays their game for them is one less cent they can't make. My theory is with the etf they've sort of become a traditional bank with their reserve (silver) being turned into a cash generating enterprise via the selling of premium. I estimated they were raking about 10 mil of premium a week and while certainly not earning it all via some expiring itm vs their non covered positions, the amount they do is a healthy and lucrative business when there is no major risk to the underlying when you rig the game and have all of the cards.

Futures are better as you are greater leveraged and can buy after hours. GME after 5pm (edt) Friday moved generally like silver does from 6pm-8pm which I find highly interesting given this now attempt to get us to take our eyes off the target and to rely on many years old articles that are now materially false if you were to Google out this theory.

Long term prognosis is as always - whatever the man says to do in the retail arena, means they want you to hold their bags so at a minimum please disregard.

Tl;Dr hold/buy gme and walk away from the computer, do not buy silver of any variety except to jump in on the manipulation as it trades very predictably particular towards Friday when SLV options expire and triple so when the monthly variety are what's expiring, mods are /

Title: GME: the case for a value play
Ive written a couple of attempts at posts that got taken down. Im going to try again.

Theres a huge misleading narrative that WSB picked GME because of its short interest and thats the only reason the short squeeze is on.

Heres the thing...

WSB hated on the GME DDs! The pile on happened after the initial squeeze began...

## This was always going to happen

Lets start at the beginning.

GME was shorted at 171% at 2.50. To use DFVs words: thats a seriously ballsy bet!

GME was never going bankrupt in 2021. Heres why:

1) Console cycle 

Historically, GME stock price jumps significantly when new consoles come out. This can be observed easily.

The shorts were aware of this, but bet that it wouldnt happen again because new consoles wouldnt have optical discs.

*They were wrong...*

Theres plenty of support for this thesis by real analytics investors. I give you Micheal Burry - of Big Short fame. He went in at &lt;5 because of the above console cycle.

He later said GME was a value play at 20-60, a short play at 80. The reason it isnt a short play now is because of later events.

2)  Financial Heath

This one is simple. Mid COVID, with terrible stock prices, GME bought back 7-800 million of debt.

This is simply not something a company going bankrupt does. If they were going bankrupt theyd focus their efforts on survival and bank on discharging the debt in bankruptcy court if it hit that level.

For the record, this fact is what got me into the play thanks to Uberkikz. Buying back debt is not the action of a company dying in the next 12 months.

3) Ryan Cohen and digital gold

For those of you who dont understand the times we live in, user data is literal gold when used properly. Ryan Cohen knows this. 

Lets talk about who he is: 

He wanted to found an e-commerce pet food franchise based on customer loyalty. He was laughed out of investment meetings based on the market being dominated by giants with established market and low prices.

He said that even in the age of dirt cheap virtual flea markets there was a gap to be filled via customer-centric e-commerce. He was correct. He built Chewy up and only sold it because his grandfather got sick.

RC wrote a letter to GME saying they could accelerate their shift and utilize the unique data they have on three generations of gamers to capture a market that is growing by leaps and bounds daily.

When I was looking for recovery plays, i eyed up
AMC (lol), but didnt bite. DFV and Uberkikz convinced me and I bought in.

Then Ryan Cohen upped his stake...
Then he hired an activist lawyer specializing in takeovers....
Then they PUT HIM ON THE FUCKING BOARD

Now he has 3 seats and two friendly votes.

Heres the thing, yes Reddit piled on but thats because at this point they were sold. The thing theyd been ignoring as dumb now had proof.

GME was becoming a tech company and tech companies are forward valued thanks to our bubble, look at Tesla!

This wasnt a planned attack!! 

## As soon as RC joined the board, the shorts should have covered

They made a bad bet! When Dr Wilson in the 90s realized his short of the casinos went bad, he sent a telegram saying cover all shares

Instead, they dug in and endangered everything with their over-leveraged bet ( not gonna get into share loaning and over-shorting but best believe theres something fucked there).

Reddit piled on because the bull case was clear and the shorts were in the wrong.

Theres nothing wrong with investing on an opinion.

My opinion is that theyve helped GMEs turnaround by making this news and its a foregone conclusion. Using the same metric Tesla is valued at vs sales, GME is worth 400 for the future value of an entire generation of young gamers buying from them and digitally trading in games.

Thanks for attending my TED talk. Stop the fuck
the billionaires narrative, **this is a story about shorts making a bad bet against an unlikely value play.... period**



Title: $SLV is dumb
If you really want too make a difference In the silver market and our currency In general, make a futures trading account somewhere, buy the silver future and then take delivery on that future (simaler to "exercising your option"). 

It is a long process involving paperwork but  In order to skyrocket the price of actual silver you have too force the comex too buy more silver and slv isn't going too take delivery on anything as long as the naked shorts are In controll and the dollar is more powerfull.


This action if done on a large enough scale will throw such a wrench In the works that you might not even care if you had ton of gold because you will be much more concerned about the bomb sirens and gunfire you hear too worry much about it. Either that or we will see a seamless transfer to the new global fiat, block chain based digital currency, which won't last long either. 

 I, until the recent developments with Gme   was waiting for silver to drop much lower ($17 level) before buying physical; I am still waiting for a sharp drop, but have become much more tentative In my thesis due too the implications of what's going on. I do believe that they were able to gather enough ductape and spitwads on thursday too keep fiat In tact for now.

TLDR: The only way to blow up the silver market is to take delivery on  futures contracts and force the comex too buy large amounts of silver on the open market.

Title: Your broker restricted trading, and the shorts broker may too when $GME squeezes

Repost due to mentioning *redacted*
First, you really should [read this ](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l90an8/an_explanation_of_what_caused_the_trading_halt/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

No, really, go read it. 

But if you dont have time, heres the important bit: 
The DTCC is practically the insurance of the entire stock market. They set a fee for every trade as collateral (for buyers) and return it when the funds clear. Trade funds take 2 days to clear.

All trades go through clearing houses. They facilitate trades from brokers (*like your favorite trading app*)

Lets say the upfront fee is 1% for a certain stock. When a $1mil buy order through clearing house A happens, clearing-house A immediately gives $10,000 to DTCC, and starts a wire of $1million to fund clearing-house B (sellers) Once the transaction of $$ from A-B clears, DTCC gives the $10,000 back to clearing house A. 

If it doesnt clear because Clearing house A doesnt have enough funds, the DTCC is stuck footing the bill to the sellers at Clearing house B. 

If the DTCC runs out of cash and goes down, the market goes down with it 

Now, due to the extreme volatility of meme stocks and their potential to skyrocket through the moon and beyond, the DTCC set the collateral fee to 100%, as if the price goes too high *even* the DTCC may not be able to foot the bill. This collateral-hike meant brokers such as the trading app that shall not be named had to send the DTCC an unprecedented **100%** of the value of buy orders **AND** begin a money wire of the buy order to the sellers of the stock. So, in total, thats a *cool* **200%** of every $GME buy transaction made. And so, put simply, some clearing houses did not have the sufficient funds to fulfill buy orders of $GME

**But** **what** **if** **this** **happens** **to** **the** **brokers** **of** **Melvin** **and** **other** **short** **sellers?**

When the price of $GME goes high enough, the short-sellers broker *may* (idk I just learned how to read, *this is not financial advice*) not be able to cover the **100%** collateral per trade. This **could** see a rather slow squeeze as shorts can only cover a small amount per day. 

This may cause the price go up incrementally day after day, but only if we **hold**

What do we do then? **WE HOLD** 

We **HOLD UNTIL THEY DO THEIR COVERING**

$10,000 is **not a meme**

Im not a financial professional. Please correct me if Ive gotten anything wrong.

Edit: Why is the DTCC fee even a thing? Some other people asked this question too, so they created blo-*redacted due to rules*

Title: By popular request, my technical analysis of GME
Seems the gme chart has started forming the fat guy wearing a dumb hat while sleeping patern 

https://imgur.com/gallery/THdJKkM

This is slightly bullish on its own, but you cant be 100% certain until you know how big the feet and dick paterns are, a big belly is okay but more of a curve. So I went all the way back to a few days ago and I found his body, though he was sleeping on his belly this time which is also slightly bullish. 

https://imgur.com/gallery/OI4xkFo

If I'm correct on this and the head belongs to that body we have to be extremely bullish on this pattern.

If this sleeping man sleeping on his back with a stupid hat pattern continues to form it is an extremely bullish signal. The second chin does tell me it is extremely likely to be the same body. Says that monday will open with a nice curve and then a huge spike and another even bigger spike.

Title: GME has the potential to be something bigger
The Gamestop saga has the potential to become something bigger and we cannot afford to be on the sideline enjoying the melee circus between the retail gang vs hedge funds.

You don't want to mix high emotions and the stock market no matter what the circumstances are. The Wallstreetbet community which has now seen its membership grow exponentially is now filled with emotionally charged language, emojis and high morale as they draw first blood from the hedge funds. They are now rallying the entire world to "fight their cause" by jumping into the stock. Maniac investing, sky rocketing prices, emotions, FOMO, irrationality, bubble anyone?

Financial strains are appearing in the system. Robinhood drew down all their credit lines and raised 1 billion with existing investors. Although we didn't hear from Etrade, TD Ameritrade or Interactive Brokers, we expect them to face similar stress as evident by their share trading restriction. Back in 2015, the surprise announcement by Swiss National Bank to remove the 1.20 EURCHF peg caused massive volatility that led to the insolvency of fx brokers. Brokers are built to function with certain volatility assumptions and things are fine 99.999% of the time until a Black Swan shows up. Brokers are important clogs in the stock market mechanism and they cannot afford to fail in unison. Short brokerages appear to be a good trade here.

It may not stop with GME. GME is now $320, up  10x from the beginning of the year. Mob investors who missed the boat already have other targets in their crosshairs; AMC, Express, Bed Bath Beyond and Blackberry. This will further exacerbate the problem. 

Hedge funds, the villains of the industry have their fair share of failures in their storied past, but non as humiliating as this. Weak, vulnerable retail investors came to the realisation that, when well orchestrated in a community, they can take on these giants and beat them at their game. But hedge funds also serve an important role in price discovery and their sheer magnitude of their operation are a systemic risk to the markets. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a 3.6b bailout of LTCM in 1998 to prevent a wider collapse of the financial system. Indeed, in the 2008 subprime crisis, the suspension of 2 BNP hedge funds in the summer of 2007 also marked the precipice of the crisis before things start to unravel.

Title: Zero liquidity on GME and what that means
Not financial advice, Im long GME,  
Im also retarded considering I was wrong about the gamma squeeze on Friday. I was under the impression all brokerages would allow unlimited buying of GME, but Robinhood kept lowering the amount you could buy. (I feel that if brokerages didnt continue blocking buying of shares I would have been right) 

Quick side note if you have a call contract for GME I believe you can exercise it and exceed the purchasing limit for shares.( They may not change that before Monday) 


Ok now on to the main point what does zero liquidity mean? Its essentially the fact that for GME there is close to no sellers at this point. Everyone who has their shares are holding on tight to them, so people who need to buy shares like shorts are forced to pay the price the seller chooses. With little to no one wanting to sell shares there is almost no competition between sellers trying to ask less than their competitors. This means that people are able to sell at far higher prices than if the stock was liquid. 

Zero liquidity is very good for us because we can could sell at the prices we name, and when people are forced to buy they might buy almost about any price. There were shares sold at 2,400 while it was trading below 500$. Just think about that when its trading at 2k. There is also still 121% float that means that ever single one of us will be able to exit our positions when shorts cover, and their will still be people buying after we have exited. This isnt counting any new shorts who are ballsy and try to time the top at their own peril. 

How do we know that we are close to zero liquidity? We can observe that by the actions of market participants, and by some other things such as the bid -ask spread. There have been moments where the bid- ask spread was over a 1,000$ difference in price. This means that the lowest price someone was willing to sell at was far higher than the current market price of a security. There was a fill allegedly for a 2,400$ sell this week which means that, it was the lowest price available in the market. The bid - ask difference has also peaked out of the cracks a few times, which must have been infuriating for shorts showing that no one was falling for their scare tactics. This is in  addition to a vast reduction in volume throughout the duration of the squeeze so far. 

Institutions have also been limiting the amount of shares you can buy which is very telling that things are very bad right now. The brokerages are doing this knowing full well that they will lose clients and their reputation over this, but are under so much pressure from outside forces that they do this anyway. There have also been less and less short attacks with all the stop losses already being triggered by previous attacks, and the fact they are next to useless if no one will sell at the low prices. 

Something that bodes will for our positions is also that there is big money on our side as well. There a lot of funds that have entered the fray looking for the legendary returns this has the potential to pull off. Institutions and whales recently have done a lot to save our ass recently and patch the holes that shorts were poking in our boat. While retail has had limited buying abilities they have been buying up as many remaining shares as they can get their hands on. Theres also the added fact of some HFT on our side buying shares on the short ladder attack and exerting heavier tolls on shorts. Some big money being on our side + public support + billionaires (Cuban, Elon, Burry, etc) and some politicians like AOC and Ted Cruz all decrease the chance of the SEC intervening and screwing longs over. 

Remember this though while the institutions and funds want the price to go up and are on our side as of now. They are no better than Melvin our interest are just aligned momentarily they will screw you if they make more money. 

I believe there is some undiagnosed systemic risk at play as well. If funds are forced to cover at prices above 1k they are going bankrupt but will still be forced to cover their positions. My understanding of this is that if a fund doesnt have enough capital to meet an obligation their broker is forced to step in and take the loss. Think of it like margin for a retail trader, if you sell box spreads and have 1k of collateral but take a 1mil loss the broker takes the loss while you are force to pay them back at a later date. What if you go insolvent though? Well the brokers stuck holding that loss until they are paid back if they ever are paid back. Thats in addition with Robin Hood needing to raise an additional 1billion dollars likely as additional collateral. 

Ok what to do with this information? If the prices are to high when they are forced to cover some institutions might be completely liquidated in addition to others that partially liquidate their holdings. I believe this will cause selling across the entire market when this happens. So some SPY puts placed a few weeks out might yield high profit when the squeeze happens as institutions sell to free up more capital. Just look at previous action on SPY as GME price rises dramatically. If you wanted to do some research you could probably find the bankruptcy candidates and their most held assets, and make some intelligent plays, but Im already all in GME so Im not going to bother. 



TLDR PT 69,420.69$
GME
Spy puts for squeeze if you are restricted from buying by your brokerage might allow you to still profit from Squeeze(might not)

Title: An Informative Fable
ENDGAME:

As many newcomers to this subreddit are completely in the dark about strategy, I wanted to write a nice fable in order to better explain and motivate my new HOMO sapien brothers.

A purely fictional account potentially based on real-life occurrences;

**THE GORILLA ENDGAME**

Imagine a world in which we are a collective group of 100 Gorillas. We Gorillas hold a stockpile of 100 water bottles. We'll call it a "Stock" of water bottles. Water bottles that are essential to the survival of another species, we'll call them Homo-Faggy Monkeys (HFMs). There are \~150 HFMs, clearly not enough water bottles for each and every single one of them. These HFMs have run out of water, but yet don't want to pay the market price of our water bottles. In fact, they decided that they'll tell all the other Chimps, Neanderthals, Baboons, C-orangutans (CNBC) that they don't even need water anymore. They've evolved past the necessity of water (even though NO clear evidence on any water-tracking source can confirm this news).

Some Gorillas are a bit worried - if they don't need water, will I ever make a profit if I sell my water bottle? If I sell now, maybe I can secure my water bottle profit, and the last Gorilla with a water bottle might lose his initial money instead. This is exactly what the HFMs want, for the Gorillas to relinquish their supply of water bottles, based on a false narrative that the HFMs have disseminated.

However, if you look at the REAL matters of fact in this great Ape story, the rest of the water on the market is starting to dry up. The great watering holes - we'll call them SPY, DOWJ, and NSDQ for short - are starting to shrivel up. The HFMs are still consuming water! They HAVE NOT EVOLVED, and still are desperate for water. In fact, they're drinking MORE water trying to convince themselves (and the great Gorillas) that they don't need water! 

Because here is the real alternative. At some point, the weaker HFMs will face an existential crisis. They NEED water. They cannot survive the cost of not having water for another day. Reluctantly, the weak and smaller HFMs must capitulate and purchase the first water bottle. Now, with less water bottles available (as the 1st weak HFM has consumed the first), the SECOND weakest HFM must purchase the 2nd water bottle at a higher price (more scarcity, and the price floor was set by the 1st HFM). The second HFM can't afford to survive without water any longer. One by one, the dominos fall. Each succeeding HFM must pay a higher and higher price. Finally, the LAST water bottle in the possession of the Gorillas is purchased at the HIGHEST price, because there is scarcity in water bottles, there are more HFMs in this water war than there are actual water bottles.

So you see, the longer the Gorillas can HOLD ONTO THE WATER BOTTLES, the higher the price the water bottles get. In fact, if the Gorillas hold onto the water bottles longer, the LAST Gorilla gets the most money, because the last HFM is existentially compelled to purchase it, at whatever price.

So you see, this is not a ponzi scheme of water bottles. You're not fighting other Gorillas over making the most profit on your water bottles. All Gorillas must know that there are more HFMs than Gorillas. They pay a price each and every day they don't have a water bottle. At some point, one weak HFM will have to buy at whatever price. Then all the HFMs will have to buy at whatever price. And the last Gorilla with the last water bottle gets the MOST money. 

\---

If you enjoy my purely fictional story regarding Apes, please share so that the newer Apes in the subreddit understand the REAL picture. That Gorillas are under no threat if they do not sell their water bottles early. And in fact, the last Gorilla makes the most profit on their water bottles.

I'll spice up this story with some eye-catching emojis.

Title: WHY EXXON IS GOING TO THE MOON 
Recently everyone's been trying to locate the next short squeeze, but this is the biggest play of 2021 that truly capitalises on the retail trading frenzy. I call it a deep value play. 

Exxon has generally been overlooked by the market, where renewable energy (and GME) are all the hype right now. They anticipate that with Biden in office, the US and the rest of the world will experience an accelerated transition towards renewables.

However, there are certain industries where renewables will not overtake the status quo so easily. 

Specifically, I'm talking about the wax industry. Exxon has been an established wax supplier for over half a century and has developed long-standing client loyalty. ([https://www.exxonmobil.com/en/wax](https://www.exxonmobil.com/en/wax)) 

Now if you look at Exxon's range of wax products on the link, you'll see that the 'Parvan' line of fully refined paraffin wax stands out in particular. As a matter of fact, if you look at the section outlining its uses:

PARAFFIN WAX IS USED TO MAKE CRAYONS

WSB HAS GROWN 400% OVER THE PAST MONTH AND IS ON TRACK TO REACH 30M SUBSCRIBERS THIS YEAR (according to   mods)

CRAYON-EATING RETARDS ARE ON AN EXPONENTIAL RISE

THE CRAYON INDUSTRY IS ABOUT TO BLOW UP!!!! 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: exxon makes paraffin for crayons, population of crayon-eating retards set to triple this year, demand for crayons will rise meteorically and cause a short squeeze in the crayon market.

Positions: the free share of Exxon that I received

Title: If you're on Robinhood, you could trigger the squeeze.
All accounts on Robinhood are **margin accounts** by default. Robinhood makes money by **lending out your shares and taking all the interest for themselves**.

So what do you do? Contact Robinhood support and ask them to turn your account into a **Robinhood Cash** account.

This means if Robinhood is lending out YOUR SHARES, then they will have to call back those shares and the shorts will have to close out that position.

This is **BUYING PRESSURE** and gives you control of your assets.

Title: Obfuscation, Misinformation, Propaganda, and GME!
Hello **retards**, I am a Cybersecurity professional. I have worked in propaganda prevention, phishing, technical control implementation, and cyber-warfare capacities. Some of you are retarded, if not most of you. So I have written this guide to help you understand the tools, tactics, and procedures used by nation-states, organised crime, and bad actors to persuade people to take actions outside of their own best interests!

At this stage, you are seeing a combination of all three techniques being used by a combination of nation states and financial sector bad actors. Spend five minutes looking into US foreign relations if you want to understand why nation states are interested in manipulating the outcome of this short squeeze.

1. Obfuscation is the action of making something obscure, unclear, or unintelligible.
2. Misinformation is false or inaccurate information that is communicated regardless of an intention to deceive.
3. Propaganda is information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote a political cause or point of view.

Anyway, here are some things to look out for, a **TLDR at the end will help you understand your best defensive measures available**.

# Creating Noise

We are seeing a significant uptick in bot traffic to Reddit, Twitter, and other social media. This appears in all data really, especially trading data. Adversaries like to create noise to make it difficult to get truly valuable information for a standard user. We are seeing 7 million members in WallStreetBets. At this stage, it is very likely that over a million of those accounts are involved in propaganda.

While our moderators have some success with using automated moderation to remove low-karma or low-age accounts, any sensible blackhat offensive security outfit would have created thousands or potentially hundreds of thousands of accounts pre-emptively over time. Alternatively, they would have a suite of compromised reddit accounts ready for use. If you share your password across multiple websites, there is a great chance you have at least been involved in a data-breach and had some of your accounts stealth-stolen. 

With a lot of accounts available, you can then set them up to either automatically post content either calling Reddit API's (Captcha doesn't do shit, check appsec california 2019) or you can use something like mechanical turk service to pay literal peanuts to poor people to do menial tasks. So, expect that a lot of activity in this sub-reddit, on twitter, and on other social media is coming from non-reputable sources and designed to mislead you. 

# Excessive Information

Detailed analysis, legalese, or complicated sentences are a fantastic way to mislead people. Consider what the average person is, and then remember 50% of the population are stupider than them. A lot of narrative strength and credibility comes simply from using language that is difficult to parse or comprehend for the average person. If you see posts that are using very technical language, remember that either the person has no idea how to communicate, or they are very intentional with how they are communicating.

# Internal Jargon Builds Trust

By using jargon and language that is familiar to people, you are in a position of trust. As an adversary, I would always do reconnaisance ahead of time to understand the culture of the organisation I am targetting. Once you have the internal language mastered, you can build credibility with your sentences. Apes be strong, Retard Strength, Guh, whatever. This is a public forum, it will be easy for an adversary to gain trust and credibility from using our language.

# Expert Analysis vs Crowdsourced Expertise

Nowadays, humans are migrating away from expert PoV's towards crowd-sourced or community views. This has some positives, sometimes experts get it wrong especially in the field of economics and finance. Secondly, like getting a second opinion from a doctor, you're able to get a seemingly broader perspective about what is good.

The problem with this is that you cannot always rely on crowd-sourced expertise, and academic standards often have very rigorous procedures involved. Now, in this situation, you can't rely on a uni whitepaper. This is fairly unprecedented. But you shouldn't entirely discount the opinions of experts in the media at the same time.

# Qualitative vs Quantitive Data

As humans, we tend to easily believe Quantitive Data over Qualitative. Numbers, Math, Statistics, Charts, they all require significantly more effort to disprove than to create. Because of this lopsided nature, they're used a lot fo misinform and manipulate opinion. Especially concerning is that most individuals do not feel qualified to question empirical data.

# Summing up or TLDR

* There is a significant increase in content attributable to both new-users, bad actors, and bots. There is a lot of copy-pasting, a lot of meme'ing, and also a lot of bullshit. Don't get stressed by the sheer amount of content available now and take everything you read with an open mind that it may not be written in your best interest.
* There will be a lot of new technical posts trying to explain the situation. Remember that most retards can't comprehend anything like that. Good Autists can choose to write in a non-technical way to help us apes. Bad actors will intentionally choose difficult language to build credibility. Question things that aren't written in CLEAR and SIMPLE language.
* You can't do much about hiding our cultural language, everybody knows it now. Just remember that there are some novice adversaries who will be 'fellow school kids' and not do their reconnaisance. Also remember that you will feel more trusting of users who use this language, and pull that emotion back.
* While mainstream media is looking into manipulating content for their hedge-fund masters, remember that there are still academics and other independent experts who can provide good analysis. Reddit is good for crowd-sourcing expertise, but don't forget that independent academics exist too who are, arguably, more difficult to manipulate.
* Don't trust charts, statistics, or anything numerical at face value. This content is chosen because it is difficult and time-consuming to disprove, and provided legitimacy and credibility to the author with low effort. If you lack expertise in that area, consider the chart or opinion to be misleading by default.

Hope this helps you redditors with your memes over the next month, I expect a huge disinformation campaign to continue to be orchestrated against this subreddit for a long time to come.

Title: Customer-Centric Fundamental Analysis of $AMC
Sorry if this DD sucks ass and leads a bunch of people to ditch $AMC. Just focus on the future, and think about the mind of the consumer. Most of that shit they teach in business school is bullshit. Trust me.

I will return to that a bit later in this DD. Here's another take based on fundamentals on why you might consider $AMC at \~$13/share one of the great value investment opportunities of our time. ~~Bear~~ with me as I, too, am just a retard like some of the readers here.

Let's begin with the basic asymmetries in a macroeconomic context:

* Market Cap (MC):  427.869 M
* Enterprise Value (EV): 11.349 B

When seeing that figure, you might wonder if you don't know shit, why might a company have an enterprise value so much greater than its Market Cap. A Company's EV is the total debt + market cap - cash on hand. As you may have heard in the recent news, nobody is having trouble getting access to cash. So then, why might that figure be significant at all if it is practically just about how much the company owes + aggregate value of the stonk. Well, my father used to say, the price of a product is what someone is willing to pay for it. If someone wanted to buy or takeover AMC, they need to pay around 11.349 B. In a few months, I anticipate that number to be so much higher.

The main reason I think $AMC dropped so low and generated so much short seller risk to begin with is the fact that there was a bankruptcy risk. That risk has been wholly eliminated, though I never saw it.

As we find ourselves in a cash flush world where at least 18 Trillion in debt is negative yielding ([mostly bonds](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-11/world-s-negative-yield-debt-pile-at-18-trillion-for-first-time)), we should expect a company with so many assets and a previously healthy balance sheet like AMC to be have access to some of it. The rising stonk price even incentivized Silverlake to convert their debt to shares and sell them (silly bankers).

At the same time, the all-star CEO boomer Adam Aron himself grabbed an additional $304.8 M in cash through a direct listing initiated on Monday. I don't know why he couldn't wait until Wednesday to initiate because [it would've been over $1B](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-stock-sale/amc-seizes-on-rally-to-sell-stock-but-misses-even-bigger-payday-idUSKBN29W2UP). I trust his judgement. Boomers are more experienced and have ~~steady~~ hands. At the same time, Aron beat back the well known short selling smuts known as Apollo Global Management as they attempted to force bankruptcy on AMC.

The confluence of these factors (EV, Access to Liquidity, Stellar Executive Team) and the four I outline below, lead me to believe that even Stevie Wonder can see that this stock is obviously worth at least $30/share.  


**The undisputed market leader in theaters.**

* 1,0004 Theatres worldwide
   * Many auditoriums at AMC locations, often holding over more than one auditorium, seat over 400 people. 
      * They posted 5.47 million in revenues. Auditoriums were rarely at capacity.
   * 8,043 screens/auditoriums.
   * They will all be packed when opened back up.
      * Tons of really great movies were held anticipating the end of the lockdown and the re-opening of the movies. Keep this in mind. This is critical to the fundamental analysis and related to the subsequent points.
   * Margins are *ok* but especially good on the snacks. In the past, consumers have tended to say fuck AMC's margins and bring in their own goodies either because AMC's were ass or because they wanted to save a few dollars. We expect this pattern to slow down substantially because of what they mean for the people.  I recognize that this one is a reach, but it's my opinion not investment advice.

**The shifting sentiment from "Netflix and Chill" to in-person, shared and enjoyable experience.**

* I don't like people, but I miss them. Maybe you do too. In a mid-pandemic Gallup Poll, we all know how much those matter, [https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/movie-theaters-covid-consumers-uncomfortable-1234846743/](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/movie-theaters-covid-consumers-uncomfortable-1234846743/). If I just put my finger in the air and give 35% of Netflix's market cap to AMC... you see where I'm going with this.
* I have seen others say this one as well, but I miss when everyone went to the movies and watch the same thing, on the same screen, at the same time because we can share. 
* Netflix and the streamers need to watch out because come July, the boomer is coming with that heat. Everyone is anticipating trips to movies. I tried to make the popcorn. I used a half a stick of butter. It's not the same.
   * Running to 7-Eleven to get Slurpees and Raisinets while Netflix is buffering is super annoying. Last time, my 7-Eleven didn't even have Raisinets. \[Samuel L. Jackson voice\] "Where's my mothafuckin Raisinets Jack?"
* As you think through this point, remember the last time you saw Samuel L. Jackson in the theaters. you weren't the only that was scared, so it was entertaining and not stressful.
* This point isn't totally out of my ass either. As streaming popularity has grown, so has AMC's  revenues, not including 2020. People watch more movies.

**Relationship with distributors and studios is still a strong moat.**   
Everyone here should check out a movie. They don't have the awesome search and browse capabilities afforded by Netflix or the sweeping device compatibility. You can stream from your laptop and connect to your.  


* Studios have ben delaying their films repeatedly to wait for AMC to open back up. To me, that sounds like immense power and a very strong relationship. I commend the studios for that and I think you have to be a hedge fund jackass not value that moat accordingly. Even Morningstar sees that and they usually don't see shit!
* The Netflix app is cool but we can all agree, &gt; 80% of the content is ass. Movies are a crap shoot. Shows are a political statement. And there's not enough Chapelle.
   * What Chapelle represents amongst so many other things is someone who has walked away from the traditional film industry. While I am all for the new person on the block, I feel movies are very hard to make. Sometimes the Netflix ones suck hard. I don't recall too many times when I went to a movie theater and had to leave because the movie sucked that bad. I've been disappointed, underwhelmed, but have never chucked my remote at the screen. I cannot say the same about Netflix. I have seen some terrible shit on Netflix, multiple times. I go there every day still because their app is so good, but Hollywood is still better at making films than Los Gatos or wherever the fuck. \*
* You can rent some of the movies that would be in theaters now. I'm sure the quality of the acting and dialogue will be superior to the shit we often get on Netflix.
   * I haven't done it yet, but I promise to do it for the first time tonight as I discovered the [On Demand](https://www.amctheatres.com/movies/news-of-the-world-61825) product line in doing some research for this DD. I assure you that the products will be overpriced, and the digital experience will be ass, but they just got $300 M to go figure that shit out. 
   * Boomer CEO: Lower your price point and move your on-prem servers to EC2 instances. You got this! Re-invest hard for a while as you build up the integrations to be a first-class citizen in Roku, etc. 

**Fresh Short-Squeezed Orange Juice.**

In doing more research, I learned that both AMC and AMCX were seeing incredible short interest. Every resource I used reported both higher than they should be, but the inconsistency in the numbers from trusted and premium services has led me to withhold my numbers.  The ranges for AMC were between 24% of total float and 68% of total float. When I tried to calculate myself based on short interest theory and the average volume of the stock as of  a month ago, I landed at 62. Since I am retarded, the answer is probably in the 40-50s.

**Current short volume:**  44,670,000 shares

**True Float:** \~71,000,000 shares

**Dollar Volume Sold Short:** $385.50 million 

On the last one yes, you read that right. This idiots have sold more volume in price than the market cap of the stock. How could they do this shit all over again. They don't give a fuck. They think they will get away with it. 

Regardless, some idiots sold another 8,000,000 shares short. Well, I have 2500 shares across four platforms. I am buying more on Monday, but my buddy had an interesting idea because the stock is so low. Options may actually be an even better play for me because I can buy hundreds of them (thanks to this subreddit). If I exercise as many options as I can hold the stock with diamond hands, it could accelerate the gamma squeeze that will happen if those short selling assholes don't back down.  And we know they won't . 

In closing, as with $GME, I have fond memories of my times at AMC as a child and teenager. It was the first place my friend drove me after he got his license. 

Also as with $GME, I like the stock.

**Positions****:**

shares: 2479, avg cost basis of 6.54,  I have been building up for a while

options: a lot (strike prices ranging from $2.5 to $9 because these jackasses thought they knew wtf was going on but are out of touch with the commoner. On Monday, I will buy more. 98% of my options are already in cheese.

&amp;#x200B;

On WeBull, I learned that you can buy stonks starting at 4 AM / 7 AM or something like that so I am moving some money in there.

\[\*\] I know Netflix has a Los Angeles office you jackass. A lot of their content still sucks. It's just a fucking fact.

Title: OPK will sure to rise once the $1.9 Trillion stimulus package goes through
So, as of today the Biden admin. is trying to push the stimy through congress, which of course the price tag is 1.9 trillion. 

Why does this mean that the stock will rise in price? Cause of [this](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/14/politics/biden-economic-rescue-package-coronavirus-stimulus/index.html). The article breaks down the most important parts about it, and the last part is getting vacc. AND testing. OPK is a pharma company and has its own lab for testing covid. It also proved it's testing capability in early January for the buffalo bills football game. Hence is why I think that the price will rise.

Title: Robinhood is the Clearing House
Haven't seen anything on this yet. Robinhood is trying to shift the blame away to the clearing houses and not themselves. 

They are the clearing house. [https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/whats-clearing-by-robinhood/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/whats-clearing-by-robinhood/)

Title: Suporting the case for SLV with a chart, historical data and a retard with Microsoft paint
So I've read quite a few good DD's on silver lately and I've been really into charts today so I decided to see if I could find any sort of patern or anything really. What I found is actually super interesting, to me anyways. But dont forget, past performance does not equal future performance and this is all just speculative, but then again banks and people do have patterns, so if it is as highly manipulated as they say it is, maybe this is something. Anyways heres my retard document I spent far too long on.

https://imgur.com/gallery/gA6gbZP

So bassically we have a batman pattern in 2008 and were curently on the right ear of a batman patern right now. Whats interesting is the VW infinity squeeze happened in October 08, just to the right of batmans ear. We are currently in the middle of a GME infinity squeeze, and are currently, on batmans right ear. The difference is what side of batman the crashes are, in 2008 the crash is to the right of batman, in 2020 the crash is to the left of batman. So that kills the pattern right? Wrong, in 2008 The fed didnt start the quantiative easing until 3 months after lehman brothers went bankrupt and the worst that could happen, happenned. In 2020 the fed Started QE as soon as possible, thus the reversed sides of batman make complete sense.

With all this said, this could mean that SLV will finish it's batman ear and the gme squeeze will crash SLV and then a recovery to ATH, it could mean that because of the reversed crash patterns SLV will start climbing to ATH without finishing batmans ear, or, the most likely scenario, this means absolutely nothing and I just wasted a couple hours of my weekend.

Title: DISABLE YOUR BROKER TO STOP YOUR BROKER LENDING OUT YOUR SHARES TO SHORT
Full disclosure, I didn't even know about this 10 minutes ago    

  

My broker is Webull and they automatically enabled the "Stock Lending Income Program" [https://www.webull.com/hc/categories/fq525?caseCode=personal&amp;visitSource=10](https://www.webull.com/hc/categories/fq525?caseCode=personal&amp;visitSource=10)   

 

"While your shares are on loan, you will be paid an income that is accrued daily and credited to your account on a monthly basis. Once you have participated in this program, Apex, our clearing firm, will identify fully-paid stocks in your account as in-demand according to the demand of the market."

&amp;#x200B;

Steps I took for Webull:

1. Click on center button in the app
2. Click "More"
3. "Stock Lending Income Program"
4. Disable it   

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think Webull and Apex have our best interest, so I think it's better. Someone less autistic please comment if this is true.

Title: GME DD (also AMC): Evidence that the hedges are scared

Title: STPK: Star peak energy transformation - A potentially massive battery/EV/solar play that hasnt already gone 100x
Whats up my dudes, I believe that star peak energy transformation (STPK) has some real potential to rip some faces off both this year and over the next few years

Tldr: Compelling artificial intelligence software + top-notch management + green new deal + stonk hasnt already gone 100x = massive gains 

STPK recently completed a merger with Stem Inc., positioning the company as an industry leader within the smart energy storage market. 

This is a pure energy play that has yet to already go through multiple parabolic moves like many other EV/solar/battery oriented stocks

Star Peak's leadership team brings an array of past experience that will be crucial to commercializing Stem's products. The transition from fossil fuels and the acceleration of decarbonation through government enacted incentives gives Star Peak a terrific tailwind to begin building upon in 2021.

The biggest upside for Star Peak over other recent acquisition mergers is actually the minimal downside this stock offers. With ~$525 million of cash available and no debt on Stem's balance sheet, Star Peak has very little negatives IMO, Not to mention the stock has taken a bit of a dump recently so now may not be a terrible time to get in - at the end of the day though there will be volatility, and this is definitely not something to enter if you are worried about the price dropping in the near term. If star peak can play their cards right, I will leave the upside potential here is massive

Good luck hombres! 

Positions: long shares: STPK, Nvidia, Google, BlackBerry, many more stonks.

Title: PSA: IsTheSqueezeSquoze is NOT accurate!
The second bullet point on their site says "**short share public availability:** 0"

This is not true.  On Friday, I placed a test short order on GME with my broker (E\*TRADE) and got a locate within 30 seconds @ 24% borrow fee.  I have been doing this several times a day for the entire two weeks I've been in this trade, and this was the first time I did not receive the message "we are unable to accept your order because there are no shares available to borrow"

In addition, please take any data provided by S3 / Ihor Dusaniwsky with a major grain of salt.  I have been trading TSLA for years and often relied on short interest as a signal to time swings.  Their models have frequently been WILDLY off the official biweekly NASDAQ SI reports.  And I don't have a whole lot of faith that their models are built to accommodate this sort of black swan event.

Good luck and godspeed to all.  I am personally looking to double up if / when E\*TRADE starts showing zero shares to borrow one more.

Title: How GME and Citadel could be the catalyst for the next major correction. Warning, bear hopium is strong in this one.
Pretty sure everyone and their mom at this point know about the whole GME short squeeze and how Citadel is getting rekt. Media and the Reddit hivemind created this whole narrative that Reddit is responsible for squeezing Citadel and co when in reality WSB is just a pawn for the other hedge funds to kill Citadel. Everyone is out here playing 4D chess, look how much profit some of these hedge funds made going long on Gamestop while killing their rival, Citadel.

&amp;#x200B;

There are either 2 outcomes from this mess:

1. Citadel and co gets a slap on the wrist and nothing happens. (highly doubt this will happen due to the major media coverage on this and the whole narrative on how this is a "david vs goliath story")
2. Citadel and co goes bankrupt and fucked in the ass by SEC. If and when Citadel goes bankrupt, all the brokers are now liable to pay the winners, then the banks are liable, and so on... This will have a domino effect on the market, considering Citadel is quite big. This is literally a time bomb waiting to explode, just look at the current VIX. (probably might happen if no one bails them out)
3. The rival hedge funds that are long on Gamestop takes profit and flash crash GME so that Citadel can get out of their short while everyone wearing a suit and tie makes profit off this. (highly doubt this will happen, this would actually the biggest 5D chess move)

&amp;#x200B;

VIX also popped up on Wednesday in response to the whole Gamestop thing. This could very well be the catalyst that kills the bubble when this is all over.  


Currently long UVXY and holding QQQ puts.

Title: Stop Overlooking Kodak
Listen up retards, I know you have a short attention span so Ill make this quick:  

Kodak originally skyrocketed when news of a government $765m loan was announced to kick start them into becoming a pharmaceutical company during the midst of the pandemic. Yes, yes, I know.. Kodak seems like the company trying to jump on the bandwagon.. a cryptocurrency in 2017, and now pharma in 2020? Anyway, it retraced most of its gains when the SEC opened up an investigation on wrongdoing related to expected insider trading.  

 \-About a month and a half ago, the conclusion was made that there was no wrongdoing related to insider trading, the loan, etc. Now, that doesnt mean it will still go through, but it certainly doesnt mean it wont. Kodak has made several announcements they will be getting into Pharma whether or not the loan goes through. With covid still looming, I dont see what would have changed regarding the loan and with the original announcement being mid last year, an update MUST be coming regarding Kodak &amp; pharma. 

 \-The market cap is only 700 million dollars. (Micro cap) This is minuscule, its less than the amount of money the government was going to give them, and is why Kodak went up so much when it was announced -Its literally more than the company was even worth! Market cap is important because it means Kodak has the potential to increase heavily over its current share price of \~$9.60. The higher the market cap, the more money required for a stock price to increase. For example, People are buying Nokia which already has a 30 billion market cap- thats not going anywhere significant with nothing significant happening presently. 

 \-Relatively high short interest of 25.5% as of last week. This could spark a huge run. If price gets out of control, it would force shorts to cover. Its obviously not one of the very top shorted companies, but its up there and with explosive price action Kodak is known to have, shorts seem to probably expect this by now. Once it breaks the current resistance it may fly catching the shorts off guard. 

 \-Huge bullish flag/pennant technical setup is primed to breakout. Check the longer term chart.         

**My positions (not huge):**

Title: The next move: PCG (Pacific Gas and Electric). Catalyst from Palantir's Foundry. 
Ok, this is my 4th time trying to post this... I'm not sure what I wrote that's triggering it to get flagged... but here we go again. 

*I'm not a financial advisor, nor is this financial advice. This is my understanding and perception of PCG based on my experience and research. Go fuck yourself.*


**INTRO**  

Don't worry about jumping on this Monday, this will be a slow mover for a few weeks. Wait to cash out your GME positions after the squeeze climaxes into infinity! Then, put some of those profits aside into a safe 500% return from a utility company. It's always good to diversify.

**TL:DR** \- PCG is weighed down by liabilities from sparking a massive wild fire in 2018 that leveled a Nor Cal town in hours (billions in liabilities, over 100 dead). They are under massive public pressure and fear that another fire will spark due to their equipment coupled with drought conditions, price $55 -&gt; $4 in weeks. Currently $11.40.

Half of the settlement to the fire victims were shares (pretty fk'd up, but it's something), let's make those shares worth $$$$$!

**Why PCG? (Pacific Gas and Electric  a.k.a  PG&amp;E)**

PCG is one of the largest power companies in California, powering almost the entire northern half of the state. They have huge amounts of assets, land, equipment, etc that already justify the current price, but that's irrelevant because the company isn't going bankrupt. They had a MAJOR hit to the company in 2018. High winds and faulty electrical equipment lead to the most deadly wildfire in recent memory. The fire leveled a town within hours due to dry conditions and wind speed. PCG got blamed for the fire and strapped with billions in liabilities.   


Since the fire, PCG has revamped it's safety protocols to prevent future events. But, the last 2 year have shown (as a California resident, with PG&amp;E power) that PCG is very inefficient. The first year (2019) was mostly a shotgun approach... if conditions were dry and an area had high winds, they cut power to EVERY-FUCKING-WHERE. It's a huge pain in the ass, but it's protecting theirs.   


This last year, it got better. I spoke with a few people that work for the city I live in, and they said that they had to contact PCG directly to let them know there was no fire danger within the city limits. So in 2020 during a big wind event, there were fewer, more selective areas turned off. Yay, they're learning... but way too f'king slow.   


**What does the company look like? Let's see the numbers.**  


I'll be honest, they aren't incredible. They are carrying a lot of debt due to burning down a town. But, that doesn't mean the profits are bad, and they are improving! Current revenue has increased year-over-year, while debt has been decreasing and looks to be fully paid off under CURRENT operating. That's not accounting for Palantir streamlining the f'k out of their operation.  


Here is the balance sheet (scroll down for the "liabilities" section to see debt): [Balance Sheet](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PCG/financials/annual/balance-sheet)  


All things considered, they are still looking like a solid company, just with a heafty bill due to a random event.   


**Accelerated recovery via PALANTIR!**

Two weeks ago, PCG announced a deal with Palantir to begin using their Foundry platform to help manage their power grid. This. is. HUGE. The biggest thing holding PCG back as a stock right now isn't it's balance sheet, it's the FEAR that another wildfire will come through and add another $10b debt to the company and drive them into bankruptcy.   


This is where Palantir's Foundry comes in. If you haven't had a chance to actually look at Palantir's software, check out the video from Demo Day 3-4 days ago. I tried to link it, but it keeps rejecting my post due to the YouTube link, so look for it on your own (fast forward to 8min for Foundry demo).  


Remember how I said that PCG had to contact the city officials in my local town directly to find out what areas were in danger during high-wind events? That information would be available to a single person, in real time, from every area connected to Palantir. Compiling information like wind speed, identifying damaged equipment, isolating at-risk areas, and making real time decisions. THIS WOULD SAVE PCG MILLIONS. Right now they have to send people out to inspect lines IN PERSON (this takes hundreds of employees HOURS to complete), and they have to call city officials in EVERY CITY and ask them ALL what areas should be blacked-out or kept on depending on risk. Can you imagine the cost of that man-power? The time involved? This took a YEAR to see improvement... But what if that COULD have been done in days, or hours???   


Palantir's Foundry has the ability to completely transform the safety of PCG. This will remove the "fear" of potential future fire event, since faulty lines, weather conditions, and overall communication between managers, techs, and field workers are all more connected, faster, and more accurate.   


**Potential**  


PCG's biggest problem has always been their ability to monitor their HUGE coverage area effectively. They are typically delayed to respond to problems, maintenance is usually only AFTER something goes wrong. Basically, the system is just too big and too antiquated.   


This is why the Palantir move is so major. PCG is the FIRST company to use Foundry. THE FUCKING FIRST. Any success from this is going to feed directly into the PLTR profit pool, because PCG becoming safe and efficient would be a GAME CHANGER. They have rode the "we're you're only fucking choice, deal with it" ticket too long, and after the 2018 disaster, it kicked them in the ass. This is their moment to actually pivot into a modern company. Value was $55 before the crash in 2018. It's worth at least that after Foundry gets rolling.   


**Final note**  


After the fires, half of the settlement to the fire victims were in shares. Fucking shares. Oh your house burned down? Our bad, here's part of the company... that's worth nothing now. FUCK YOU. I've been pissed the last 2 years about how the whole thing went down, but I get it, they can only do so much without going under in a situation like that. So, let's do our part. Let's push the price of the stock up enough that they can feel a little bit of comfort after losing everything. The company's worth more than it's valued, and far more with the adoption of Foundry. Let's send some tendies to the Paradise victims.

Title: Which kind of Silver to buy? IMPORTANT
After we finish up GME and move onto Silver, you need to know which kind of Silver to purchase.

DO NOT under any circumstance touch the ETF $SLV. They are not protected and get their silver from the government. Very shady things will happen if we try to squeeze that.

Instead there are two much better options.

1. Buy the physical asset to take it off the market.
2. Buy COMEX Futures and demand the physical asset instead of cash settlement.

#1 is worthless without #2. Creating a default on the physical supply is what will send it skyrocketing while bankrupting those shorting it and selling naked calls such as JP Morgan.

Title: BCRX: The most undervalued stock in the market
First up, I'm acting as a surrogate for u/BIO9999 as he can't post here yet but is absolutely brilliant and deserves to be heard.  He'll be around in the thread to answer questions

We are going to look at**Biocrysts**recently approved drug**Berotralstat**, AKA**Orladeyo**. It is a**once-a-day pill**given to patients with a terrible lifelong disease called**Hereditary Angioedema**, that results in them having to**frequently visit the Emergency Room**for life-threatening angioedema attacks (check out Youtube for videos of HAE patients suffering from these attacks and using Berotralstat). It is estimated that this disease affects**1 in 50,000**people in the world, or roughly**140,000 people**, so although considered a rare disease, it is still affecting a**lot**of folks. 

The available treatments for this disease are**all IV drugs**that are painful and produce local reactions. Berotralstat is the**first oral drug**. It achieved excellent results in phase 3 trials, and the US FDA gave it**fast track**status in 2018 and Japan gave it**Sakigake**status (type of fast track). Then**on December 3rd, the US granted approval for the drug**. They did it very importantly with**zero label**statements--meaning that they had no concerns about side effects or dangers.**On January 22nd, Japan granted approval**. The**EU**also met last week to discuss approval and will announce its result**this quarter**.

So let's look at what the above means for this stock. First the drug is in**HIGH**demand. In the US there are at least**10,000**people with HAE. Despite the disease being frequently debilitating, patients are so uncomfortable about getting regular injections that**only 7,500**are currently being treated with IV injections. The other 2,500 are going**untreated**despite the high risks. Now let's look at the 7,500 patients on a prophylactic treatment. Based on numerous surveys by doctors, the company, and researchers, most of these people would prefer an oral treatment. Take a look at this peer-reviewed survey article finding that[98% of IV prophylactic patients (the 7,500) would prefer an oral treatment and 96% of the non-prophylactic patients (the 2,500) would want an oral treatment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33489436/).

No wonder then that one of the preeminent biotech analysts, Evercore's Liisa Bayko, wrote to her clients on December 4th that Berotralstat was likely to quickly**take at least 30% of the HAE market**based on Evercore surveys of patient and doctor demand.

Remember that this is**just the US**.... Japan did not even have any prophylactic treatment until Berotralstat was approved there a few days ago. They have**500 people registered with HAE**and estimated**2,000 ready to be registered**. [TheUKis so desperate to add the drug for its patients, it did not even wait until the formal approval process to go through and gaveearly access to the drug on November 9th](https://angioedemanews.com/2020/11/09/berotralstat-available-to-eligible-patients-uk-through-early-access-program/#:~:text=Berotralstat%20%E2%80%94%20an%20oral%20therapy%20by,before%20its%20potential%20regulatory%20approval).

The EU is not far behind, with its estimated**20,000 patients**, with approval coming in the next few weeks. Then there is the rest of the world. The HAE patient population in**Latin America**is estimated by**HAE International**, the most important advocacy organization for HAE patients worldwide and one of**Berotralstats biggest supporters**, to be**over 15,000 patients**, the vast majority of whom are poorly diagnosed and not prophylactically treated. Argentina and Brazil have the highest actual diagnostic rates. HAEI through its Latin American sister organizations is strongly advocating for Berotralstat in Latin America.

Next, it should be noted that Biocryst built a**world-class sales team**for this drug in the US and EU and signed a**partnership with Torii in Japan**to take charge of the large sales and marketing promotion there. It has hired dozens of professionals, most from its HAE competitors. Its**vice-president**and US general manager**Allen Hodge**was even responsible for the**successful efforts of the HAE drug launches**of Cinryze and Firazyr, two pioneering injectable treatments for HAE. You could not get a more promising leader for this task.

It should also be pointed out that this drug, an oral kallikrein inhibitor, is potentially of**huge value for a host of diseases, including COVID-19**(that is now recognized to severely affect the kallikrein-kinin system, and kallikrein inhibitors have begun to be tested against COVID19--see this (IV)**kallikrein inhibitor trial that was just announced in Brazil**for instance:[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472675/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472675/)),**diabetic macular edema**(which Biocryst just obtained a patent on a technique to administer kallikrein inhibitors for), many autoimmune diseases, and even some types of cancer.

Last but not least, how should this stock be valued based on this one drug? First, this drug is**one of the 10 most expensive drugs**(based on its annual cost of prescription) in the world, but still**less than the price of its IV competitors**, at $488,000 per patient per year. This drug is being approved by insurance companies**left, right, and center**as their preferred treatment, all you have to do is follow[R8](https://stocktwits.com/R8Plus)or[nickpd](https://stocktwits.com/nickpd) on Stocktwits to see how many insurance companies have been making it easy for patients to sign up for the drug.[Optime careeven lets patients getdirect-to-patientprescriptions now](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/biocryst-scores-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-first-oral-option-to-prevent-hae-attacks). 

So what does all this mean for sales? And why is the stock not valued based on just this drug alone (I will get to the others in**future posts**)? I**estimate conservatively**that by December 2021, there will be**over 6,000 patients on Berotralstat in the US, EU and Japan**, and I can share in a future post the graphs and calculations I made to get to those numbers. 6,000 patients annualized is up to**$2.9 billion in annual sales**.**Most**of this is going to be**profit**. At a**conservative price to sales ratio of 7**, that should produce a price of**$121, not $8.52**!  If you want to play around with the math yourself, look [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tLvclUzTqCitwKfawL7kGCLquJxA2T7IJKLg52VWotE/edit?usp=sharing).

And that is**just the beginning**. Because Factor D and Galidesivir are going to be much bigger than Berotralstat for reasons I will explain in future posts. Remember that**its Factor D drug, which is showing superiority to all other anti-complement drugs in Phase I trials and was fast-tracked and given orphan status by the FDA and now is in Phase 2 though not officially announced by the company eyt,**and can be used in at least 20 diseases including common ones like Rheumatoid Arthritis, is currently**not even factoring into BCRX's valuation**. Consider that**Alexion with its significantly inferior anti-complement drug was just sold to Astra-Zeneca for $39 billion**because of the**recognized potential of anti-complement drugs**for a host of diseases. BCRX even has has**other drugs like Peramivir, already approved for Influenza and able to be used for the next bird flu pandemic, and its FOP drug--a story for another day**.

So why is this company, with**zero risk of dilution**due to an**amazing royalty deal**it signed in December and**three super-drugs**each worth tens of billions of dollars, and a host of other exciting developments to look forward to,**worth only $1.5 billion right now?**It can only be because the company's stock has been**relentlessly shorted in 2020 and 2021**to allow for significant accumulation by institutions. That is why the stock**only went up 168%**, yes "***ONLY***"**168%**... 

The time for BCRX investors is**now**. My next post will be about Factor D, brace for that one. Factor D is 10 times bigger than Berotralstat! Good luck to all!

Title: Think twice before investing in $SLV
SLV saw an inflow of almost one billions dollars on Friday, which is nearly double that of the last record. There are large banks currently naked shorting silver on the futures markets one of them is JP Morgan. It is essential to understand that there is an interest in suppressing the price of silver as every increase undermines the confidence in the U.S. Dollar. 

What is essential to know about SLV is the following: 

&gt; The sponsor of the Trust is iShares Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC (the Sponsor), a Delaware limited liability company and an indirect subsidiary of
BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock). The trustee of the Trust is The Bank of New York Mellon (the Trustee) and the custodian of the Trust is JPMorgan Chase
Bank N.A., London branch (the Custodian). The agreement between the Trust and the Custodian is governed by English law. The Trust does not have any
officers, directors or employees.

The same bank that is heavily shorting silver is the custodian of $SLV.  The last time someone tried to increase the price of silver the FED created a special rule to fuck them. The two speculators that tried and successfully (for a time) controlled the majority of silver were billionaires even before their action in the silver markets. After the intervention from the FED, they went broke, billionaires going broke isn't something you hear often. 

Be sure that you know what you are getting into and do not use money that you cannot afford to lose. If you think you can compete against the largest banks in the nation and the FED you are wrong. The price might go up for a time but the crash will be swift.

Title: Great DD from r/GME
Credit goes to u/Qui

Probably the most important thing you can read regarding GME

&amp;#x200B;

![img](qq1cm0figie61 "An article posted on Robinhood titled \"Robinhood raises 1 billion to meet surging cash demands\" Created by WSJ. Now what I want you to read is the first sentence, collateral rose 7.5 billion on Thursday. Then read the last sentence, DTCC which clears more than $1 TRILLION in trades daily. 1Trillion = 1000 Billion")

Logically it made sense that Robinhood was running out of capitol, until you do the math and read the 2 articles posted today about these firms being unable to meet the cash requirements. 

**First we examine the brokerages finances**  
 

TD Ameritrade - (2019 Average - 860,000 Trades per day, 11 million accounts and **1 TRILLION in net assets held by clients**.

(Data limited no IPO) Robinhood - (2020, 13 million accounts, 4.3 million trades, $150 billion in transactions.

E-Trade - (2019 - **398.6 billion retail assets** \+ 365 billion corporate service assets, Morgan Stanley purchased E-Trade to have a combined **3.1 Trillion in Assets**, in addition Morgan Stanley had **38.947 Billion** in free cash flow for 2019. )

Charles Schwab - (2020 - **6.69 Trillion in client assets**, Averaged 8.191 MILLION trades per day. 

eToro - (2020 -1.5 Trillion trade value cleared in a year... or **4.109 Billion per day**. 17 million users.)

&amp;#x200B;

**Next lets examine GME volume**

&amp;#x200B;

On Monday and Tuesday (25/01/2021 (DD/MM/YYYY) was at 177 million @ $100 a share, 

91 Million Wednesday @ $350 a share, 

and finally 42 million on Thursday @ high of 470 and average at 240 .

This adds up to 17.7 billion traded value Monday and Tuesday

31.85 Billion traded value Wednesday

10.08 Billion Thursday

**(Stick with me here)**

Now remember these companies are used to trading $GME at an average volume of 40 million a day with a share price of $10 or a net total of 4 Billion traded value. So in your head take out 4 billion from each of the total traded value of the stock for each day, and that is the numbers we are working with. 

Now compare this to Tesla, This year they experienced an average volume of 34.76 million. However their volume changed from the lowest over the year at 17 million @ a share price of 417.13, compared to the highest on the year at 222.13 million shares traded @ a price of $695. Those two numbers add up to **7.091 billion on their lowest day and 154.38 billion on their highest.**

**Now remember how we just saw that on $GME highest daily traded volume ever recorded they barely touched a change in value of 32 billion??? Yet somehow we see eToro, Robinhood, Charles Schwab, E-Trade and TD Ameritrade all restrict $GME because as they claim, "They ran out of money" So they can front the cost of 154 billion in a day for trading 1 stock but can't cover the 32 billion on a different day for a stock that has significant impact on their relationship with one of their banks?**

Now you tell me? Were we seconds away from igniting the largest wealth transfer in history? Were we seconds away from giving money to people who will give back, those who can help the single mother or homeless man on the side of the road because they aren't a billionaire themselves they are just another human who lives in a neighborhood, who passes the homeless man, talks to the single mother, works 12 hour shifts. We were seconds away from a wealth transfer not to a billionaire who will write a 40 million check to a charity that takes 80% for "Admin cost" but to you, me and every other person who has the ability and desire to change the lives of those around them for the better not just through a smile as you walk by or a bummed cigarette late on a Friday night, but through a physical way that only wealth can distribute.

Keep your head up, The math on this is simple, they are playing you.

Title: So AFTER THE SQUEEZE IS SQUOZE, What are you going to do with your tendies with squeeze cheese on top?  Hear me out;
What's up apes, autists, retards, degenerates, and every other person with fuckin 's. I first want to say my 5 shares of GME at $310 love every last one of you idiots, and *I'm NOT FUCKIN LEAVIN*. Our job isn't done, but at this point it's a waiting game for Melvin to realize this sub **will stay retarded longer than they stay solvent** We *like* this stock, and we *like* that game. In the words of the wise Papa Chamath "I will win." 


**BUT WHAT ABOUT AFTER THE SQUEEZE IS SQUOZE?** What are you planning to do with your platter of tendies and squeeze cheese? Looking for ideas? Hear me out retards about a stock I like, and no I'm not gonna TLDR. I need the smart apes to hear me out. 


*I'm sorry SLVer surfers, but I am not one of you, yet. I have read and heard your plea, and I willing to join you in battle (I like silver), but hear me out*

Canopy Growth Corp $CGC. ~~We could force a national conversation about marijuana reform and free millions of people, from reddit.~~ On top of being a great company **that is already the official sports drink for TWO NBA teams** they represent a unique opportunity to make tendies, continue to make an impact on the world around us with our tendies, **and free fellow retards**. While we have all eyes on us, instead of taking on JP Morgan, let's help out the **millions** of future retards currently sitting in prison wishing they could join our moon missions. The current administration promised a lot prior to the election, and I think we need to help our fellow retards missing out on our revolution(s). APES TOGETHER STRONG.  

~~"BuT CaN We SqUeEzE tHem??" **Yes, retards we fookin can.** To the tune of 1 billion dollars at the moment, and that's assuming those shorts didn't attend Melvin Short Academy and not learn how to close a position. They think stonks go down, but we know they only go down because of them. Stonks literally only go up.~~

**No one wants to be seen as targeting shorts** and I want to make it clear, that is NOT the intention here. This is a company with wildly large **catalysts** coming very soon, and already starting to boil. **EVERYONE SHOULD DEMAND TO KNOW THE SHORT LOGIC** instead of defending long positions, especially with an amazing year ahead. Why would you short this stock? To me it's probably the same people who think weed turns you into a couch. You know the commercial. 

If you're still reading, here comes the fookin 's:

[Majority Leader Chuck Schumer Spoke About Passing The MORE Act](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/chuck-schumer-says-marijuana-reform-bills-are-being-merged-as-congress-moves-to-legalize/) in an interview last week, and [tweeted about it afterwards](https://twitter.com/SenSchumer/status/1354601621670522882?s=20) . **This keg is ready to blow it just needs a little retard push** but it doesn't end there. There's more clear catalysts, and I again **do not understand the short thesis**

[Mexico is preparing to LEGALIZE marijuana THIS fucking April, 420 motherfuckers](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.borderreport.com/regions/mexico/mexico-puts-legalization-of-marijuana-on-hold/amp/) . Mexico would become the world's largest recreational marijuana market in the world, which ~~IS GOD DAMN MASSIVE~~ I guess you could call a catalyst for a recreational marijuana company, like $CGC. 

[They currently have a 15B market cap](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CGC/) in an industry that is expected to have [18% compound annual growth rate through 2025](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-cannabis-market-to-hit-47-billion-by-2025-301048501.html) . I'm really not sure if Mexico is even factored into these calculations either. 

I could go on and on, but if ~~squeeze cheese~~, tendies, helping kidnapped retards, and changing the world isn't enough for you with your investment, please let me know which SLV option we like. 

Title: Melvin Capital still isn't out, or it doesn't matter either way.
Mods, if this is just a parrot of someone else's DD feel free to take it down. I read WSB for like 12 hours a day and miss new posts all the time.

*Disclaimer: I'm a moron and not a financial expert, I own GME shares. This is all my opinion.*

Hello, my fellow retards. This GME movement has been seriously heartening for the common man, and the following that WSB has gained because of it is completely bonkers. This is all well and good, but on some level, GME is still a numbers game to me. Melvin announced that it had closed its position in GME and everyone here instantly doubted such a claim. I have some 8 pm coffee-fueled napkin math that suggests... maybe?

**Point 1:**

[Here](https://www.shortvolume.com/) is a website I've found very confirmation bias-y. It gives some ballpark numbers for short positions changed day by day. Over the last 10 days, we see a short volume of approximately 200m. That is a lot of changing shorts and give ample time for Melvin to have exited their short -at first glance at least. If we assume that every single one of those shorts was taking a new position as the price continued to rise over the last several days we see that from 1/22 through 1/26 there is approximately \~82m shorts changing hands in the sub $133 price range. Then, from 1/27 to 1/29 (after GME broke $300) there is \~34m short volume. If we assume that EVERY SINGLE SHORT got out, then bought back in as the price rose for the last \~80m volume (to ultimately bring us to the SI estimate today) the best price that the shorts could possibly be holding, on average, is about **$180 per short**. In other words, **shorts are still massively underwater even if they've been frantically covering and doubling down for the last week**.

**Point 2:**

CNBC could be lying.

**Point 3:**

[CNBC could be telling the truth.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/gamestop-short-sellers-are-still-not-surrendering-despite-nearly-20-billion-in-losses-this-year.html) This article mentions what a few experts (yes, Shkreli is an expert here) have said at this point: WATCH THE INTEREST RATE. If melvin exited their position as fast as they could, and there were not enough new shorts to pick up the slack, the interest rate would fall through the floor. I am taking this with a grain of salt considering that shorts have been doubling down throughout this month, but Melvin having probably the single largest short position on GME would definitely shake up the numbers.

**Point 4, the Devils Advocate:**

Melvin, as per the CNBC article, completely exited its position on 1/26. That Tuesday was two things: the cleanest rising day we've had since $35, and some of the highest volume GME has ever seen. In my opinion, that rise could have been caused by constant buying pressure as Melvin unwinded their position, and there was definitely the volume to support that kind of a move without *completely* fucking the price.

**My conclusions:**

Melvin being out or not isn't a huge deal, but it does make the squeeze less sweet if they are gone. I am positive that a multibillion-dollar hedge fund would rather book a 30% year loss than a bankruptcy, and that they are at least hedging their position like a madman. However, at this point, someone is still holding a -100% bag at *least* and these new shorts entering GME, then leaving almost a day later with a complete loss will push some crazy momentum into the stock so long as it generally goes sideways or up.

TR;CR:

Melvin is probably lying but it doesn't matter, buy GME. \*rocket emoji\*

Title: Yes... keep buying GME, but I think MAC could blow up. Thoughts welcome
**Wrote this for another sub, but maybe people here can tell me if I'm full-on retarded or just partially retarded.**

 I know a lot of you fuckers are already in MAC and we can make another round of people rich. Note I have a $1k stock position in MAC, so this isn't a big money maker for me since I didn't buy call options -- but I'm going to... I just want to share what I've found and how I see things, so hopefully we can have another round of poors becoming wealthy during this fucked up pandemic.

Why I think MAC is such a hold position is because look at the short interest: https://imgur.com/a/YY9Ymku. It has been at or near 70% for a long time and the short interest is dropping (see graph on imgur slide). Why I think this is important is because MAC was trading around $6 a year ago. I think a lot of shorts are already trapped at the low prices -- probably shorts at really low prices that can't get out because the current price. (That's my logic at least, someone with more market knowledge please let me know if that's not the correct way to think about things.)

Also, I think MAC has been collecting rent and has good financials/cash (like GME), so it is undervalued. (Can someone grab a good article so we can lay out the value play on MAC?)

MACs market cap is a lot bigger (5x's) that of where Gamestop was at. I think this may make it harder to squeeze -- but someone with more knowledge can maybe chime in.

Thoughts and help appreciated. And, if I'm totally idiotic, you can tell me that too.

EDIT: One other thought -- MAC is a good short-term and long-term play. If you look at options, they're really cheap. Now go look at the 5 day chart -- see how the stock has been bouncing off $23? If you buy the cheapest call options (the one I posted), I think you can easily make it to $23 -- and I think there's a possibility for a lot of $$$$$ to be had. I can't trade options right now because it's taking forever to get money into my trading account (oh, yeah, I never traded until GME and I've never traded options, so again, I'm a retard). But -- DFV made the majority of his money on calls so if one of you fuckers strike it rich on the option, at least leave me a thumbs up on here. Don't buy Reddit medals -- put it in GME.

Title: BB is rising back up in the shadows  (Explanation) (DD?)
There are two main things going on in the midst of this heavy manipulation seen similar in NOK and AMC. Despite the prices being bad, our hype is actually gaining.  


For a while we were fourth place on [wsb.gold](https://wsb.gold) but now we've jumped right back up to third place despite yesterday's tough day.  


Not only that, institutional ownership has likely jumped from 45% to 60+% recently despite all the crazy nonsense going on

[https://fintel.io/so/us/bb](https://fintel.io/so/us/bb)

Either way, we still have a short squeeze opportunity not far off from VW. It's not GME/AMC level but it still has a very good percentage with the fact that long term growth is facing us in the future.  


TL;DR  BB TO THE MOON LETS FUCKING GOOOOO 

Title: An alternative to transferring brokerages and potentially missing the squeeze: Robinhood Cash Account.
A ton of this sub uses Robinhood and after what happened the last few days, we all want to jump ship.  

Not only did Robinhood restrict buying of GME, but since we are all on Margin Accounts, technically Robinhood owns the stock and simply passes many of the rights of ownership to us, crediting us with quasi-ownership.

This is important because if Robinhood fails, we don't actually own our stocks - Robinhood does and those shares we paid a lot for could just as well go bye-bye.

The obvious solution is to get the fuck off Robinhood, but it ain't that simple. If you begin a transfer of your assets to another brokerage, your positions will be frozen for up to 2 weeks. Every single day counts right now, and that is simply not an option.

As much as we shit on Robinhood, we really need to be rooting for them to succeed and get an influx of cash to be able to post it as collateral with DTCC to get our trading activity back to normal.

All that being said... there is an alternative solution to save our asses:

**Robinhood Cash Accounts**

[Details here - CLICK MEEEEE\~](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/robinhood-accounts/)

In short, when you sign up for Robinhood you start off with a **Robinhood Instant** account. This is a margin account.

If you're like many of the retards on here, you upgraded it to a **Robinhood Gold** account. This is still a margin account.

There is a third option: a **Robinhood Cash** account. You do not get access to instant deposits. You do not get access to instant settlements. If you sell anything, you'd need to wait 2 trading days before having access to the cash. Essentially, you're no longer relying on the magic of margin accounts to make everything look instantaneous to you.

Does that suck? Yeah, kinda, but **you get full control and ownership of your shares**.

I will be downgrading my account to a Robinhood Cash Account and once this is all over, I'll be transferring to another brokerage.

Title: *PG&amp;E: a Firesale DD*
# Pacific Gas &amp; Electric ($PCG) 

This is my personal research into Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company.

None of this is financial advice, and is purely fiction.

**MY FIRST DD AND ACTUALLY IDK WHAT I WANNA SAY BUT I RESEARCH A LITTLE SO LOOK IF U WANT, LET ME KNOW IF YOU GUYS HAVE ANY MORE TO ADD TO THIS CASE THANKS.**

*General Background*

&gt;Sector: **Utilities**  
Industry: **Electric Utilities**  
&gt;  
&gt;PG&amp;E Corp. is a holding company, which engages in generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and natural gas to customers. It specializes in **energy**, **utility**, **power**, **gas**, **electricity**, **solar and sustainability**.   
&gt;  
&gt;The company was founded in 1995 and is headquartered in San Francisco, CA.

[CHART &amp; FINANCIALS](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-PCG/)

PG&amp;E has a large market cap coming in at $22.684B. And had a revenue of $17.129B.

So why does it have such a negative cash flow? 

    A quick glance at the EBITDA also shows a glimmer of hope. But this metric can be misleading given the nature of the utility industry. Where depreciation and amortization can way heavy on their expenses, replacing power plants and equipment over their vast network is expensive. 

*The Compounding Risks*

You may have heard of how catastrophic this company has been to the environment and people of CA.

&gt;In the last nine years, California has seen a growing number of unnatural disasters that have taken the lives of more than 90 people and caused more than $40 billion in damages. They all have one element in common: They were caused by Californias largest investor-owned utility, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E).

[HISTORY SOURCE -- LETS OWN PG&amp;E](https://letsownpge.org/history/)

The impacts of these events can be felt for decades. Litigation is expensive and also takes years. 

    For example:
    In 2019 they paid $11B  for the California wildfires that torched wine country back in  2017 and for the Campfire in 2018 that killed 85 people and destroyed the town of Paradise, CA.

[2019 $11B SETTLEMENT SOURCE](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/13/760479525/pg-e-to-pay-11-billion-insurance-settlement-over-wildfires-in-paradise-and-elsew)

The litigation expenses caught up with PG&amp;E.

**They filled chapter 11 bankruptcy on January 29th 2019.**

*What is chapter 11 bankruptcy, more specifically "debtor in possession"?*

&gt;Chapter 11 is typically used to reorganize a business, which may be a corporation, sole proprietorship, or partnership. A corporation exists separate and apart from its owners, the stockholders. The chapter 11 bankruptcy case of a corporation (corporation as debtor) does not put the personal assets of the stockholders at risk other than the value of their investment in the company's stock. A sole proprietorship (owner as debtor), on the other hand, does not have an identity separate and distinct from its owner(s). Accordingly, a bankruptcy case involving a sole proprietorship includes both the business and personal assets of the owners-debtors. Like a corporation, a partnership exists separate and apart from its partners. In a partnership bankruptcy case (partnership as debtor), however, the partners' personal assets may, in some cases, be used to pay creditors in the bankruptcy case or the partners, themselves, may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection.  
&gt;  
&gt;Section 1107 of the Bankruptcy Code places the debtor in possession in the position of a fiduciary, with the rights and powers of a chapter 11 trustee, and it requires the debtor to perform of all but the investigative functions and duties of a trustee. These duties, set forth in the Bankruptcy Code and Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, include accounting for property, examining and objecting to claims, and filing informational reports as required by the court and the U.S. trustee or bankruptcy administrator (discussed below), such as monthly operating reports. 11 U.S.C. 1106, 1107; Fed. R. Bankr. P. 2015(a). The debtor in possession also has many of the other powers and duties of a trustee, including the right, with the court's approval, to employ attorneys, accountants, appraisers, auctioneers, or other professional persons to assist the debtor during its bankruptcy case. Other responsibilities include filing tax returns and reports which are either necessary or ordered by the court after confirmation, such as a final accounting. The U.S. trustee is responsible for monitoring the compliance of the debtor in possession with the reporting requirements.

[US COURTS -- CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY](https://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-11-bankruptcy-basics)

Chapter 11 bankruptcy is going to come with added risks.

* The ability to develop, consummate, and implement a plan of reorganization with respect to PG&amp;E Corporation and the Utility during the Chapter 11 Cases that satisfies all applicable legal requirements, including the requirements of AB 1054;
* The ability to develop and obtain applicable Bankruptcy Court, creditor, and regulatory approval of a successful plan of reorganization and the effect of any alternative proposals, views, and objections of official committees, creditors, state and federal regulators, and other stakeholders, which may make it difficult to develop and consummate a successful plan of reorganization in a timely manner and by June 30, 2020;
* The risk that the Note-holder RSA, the Subrogation RSA, the TCC RSA or the PSAs could be terminated; So far there is compelling evidence that there are a number of headwinds going forward.

These are 3 out of 17 risks PG&amp;E is recognizing, with the possibility of more unseen risks. 

[2019 PCG 10k FILLINGS](https://last10k.com/sec-filings/pcg#i_0_40)

*What's next?*

So far there is compelling evidence of significant headwinds in PG&amp;E's recovery.

1. Continuing litigations and settlements are costly.
2. Debt restructuring will come with its own risks. 

As a result of the wildfires Public Safety Power Shutoff was created.

**M A G I C   K A R P   T O   T H E   R E S C U E ! ! !**

**January 19th, 2021**

PG&amp;E signed a multi-year, multi-million dollar contract with Palantir to provide Foundry software.

&gt;Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) has initiated deployment of Palantirs Foundry software to provide a single, integrated platform to give decision-makers a real-time, complete operational picture.  
&gt;  
&gt;The use of this novel technology, in its early stages of deployment, has already enabled PG&amp;E to make effective, timely, data-driven decisions related to its Public Safety Power Shutoff program and is intended to further inform its wildfire risk mitigation programs and initiatives in the future.  
&gt;  
&gt;Our engagement with Californias largest investor-owned utility underlines our commitment to increasing safety and reliability for customers and communities across the region, said Olivier Farache, Palantirs Head of Utility Sector and Senior Advisor to the CEO. It shows our Foundry software can power data-driven decisions that aim to improve service delivery.

[SOURCE](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210119005164/en/Palantir-Providing-Technology-to-Enhance-Safety-and-Reliability-of-Electric-Grid-in-California)

The increasing size and magnitude of PG&amp;E's operation innately led to an increase in disasters.

 &amp; Corruption within the company have slowed recovery and any efforts towards lasting change on its infrastructure.  

With the use of Foundry this could be the start of less wildfires and a more efficient utility company. 

The road ahead is a tough one for PG&amp;E. But its tempting when its stock price is at levels we have not seen since 1999. And when debt restructuring + Foundry software could change the long term out look of the company. 

**The play?**

Bull case: Foundry significantly helps mitigate disasters and debt restructuring is approved quickly... **$17c Expiring December 17th**

Currently (Jan 29th, 2021) they are priced at $0.99.

Title: I want to thank you all
I got into the GME/AMC game a bit late around 60 a share for GME, and I was only able to put in 400usd, and sadly I had to cash out when it hit around 450 a share, not because I wanted to, but because I needed to cover my fathers co-pay for 6 surgeries in the past 30 days, but without this group, I wouldn't have been able to cover those cost, and he may longer be here.

From the bottom of my heart, I thank every one of you retards, You are my Tards for life.

Title: A possibility for the next couple of weeks that I haven't seen many people consider.
This is speculation, not advice. I'm not a financial expert. This is my personal opinion on what might happen with $GME in the next two weeks, based wholly on guesswork.

A lot of people are expecting big moves in the coming weeks- possibly as early as Monday or Tuesday. It's definitely possible that we'll see some crazy stuff go down.

That said, I personally am considering a different possibility- that we'll see a repeat of Friday, where the price stays largely level and stable the whole time. Maybe a couple of smaller dips and peaks here or there, to make things seem realistic, but perhaps $GME might close out in the low to mid $300s all week.

Why might this happen? Well, clearly they realize by now that manipulating the market to artificially drive the price down does not induce panic sell-offs like they thought it would. The more they try to stomp the price down, the angrier and more ardent people get about holding that precious, precious stock.

So, and again this is where the speculation comes in- they might try keeping things nice and level. They might be at a point where they're realizing that buying back those shorts at $300 each is a lot better for them than $10,000. How to convince people to sell at $300, though? Just hold the market stable. People have short attention spans, and after a week of massive moves, seeing the price hover within a $20 range might bore a lot of people. Not only that, but the longer this goes on, the more the average person might be inclined to believe that $300 is the real price target for $GME after all.

It's just a thought. I could be totally wrong here.

**TL;DR**: MM and hedgies might manipulate the situation in the coming weeks to slow things down and make it seem like $300 is the real top for $GME, thus people could start selling not wanting to miss out on what they think is the "peak". They know forcing the price down doesn't work, so they could very well try to hold it steady instead. This is purely speculation and not advice, and I could be wrong about this whole thing.

Title: You can get a ticket on a  to the  for the same price as a ticket to the movies! $AMC breakout coming.
I've been over this a couple times, and I'm sure I will again, but I want to make sure you smooth brained autists get the message!

Friday AMC stock close: $13.26. Basically, the same price as a movie ticket.

Here's the data:

1. Stock float (Shares available to be traded): **106.60M**
2. Short float (percent of shorted shares): **41.91%**
3. Average trading volume (Shares traded in a day) including this week's activity: **84.62M**
4. Friday's trading volume (with buy restrictions in place): **594,653,177**
5. Short price **$2.15**

Now you have the data, here's the point...

Short ration is still well over 0.5! That means these bastards aren't giving up. They want to see the stock drop below $3.00, crush the company, and kill the largest employer of high school deadbeats in the country. Some short positions are moving out, but not many. Even with platforms buy restrictions in place the daily volume was 7x the average. 

Aside from the financials, people will be flooding movie theaters soon! People who haven't been to a theater in years will be piling in to see Top Gun 2, The Matrix 4, etc. **BECAUSE THEY CAN!** Movie theaters were taken away from all of us and people will be going back simply because there was a time they couldn't! 

The stronger you  the harder you can squeeze!

I like the stock. I am autist ape, not a financial advisor. Not financial advise. Just my opinion, blah blah blah...
Ape strong together!

tl/dr: AMC to $50! 

Title: Why this is different than the Volkswagen Squeeze of 2008
If you haven't figured it out by now, WE control the destiny of this squeeze.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have looked into the short squeeze on VW in 2008, you would know that it was Porsche who onset this squeeze by announcing on SUNDAY, October 26, 2008, that they had acquired a \~ 74% interest in the company including \~ 31.5% in cash-settled options. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Because Porsche was quietly building their position in VW, counterparties knew it would cause observable upward pressure on the stock price and decided they needed to hedge their written positions by buying the underlying stock. They also found that they could reduce their hedging costs by lending the underlying to short sellers. 

  
 At this point, there was only \~ 5.5% float due to Porsche's \~ 42.5% combined with 31.5% hedges by Porsche counterparties and \~21% protective stake held by the State of Lower Saxony. At the same time, short interest on the stock was around 13%. The short sellers were essentially in an infinite squeeze.

&amp;#x200B;

The difference HERE is that Porsche held the cards. They offered to settle positions on \~5% of their positions to allow short sellers to meet their obligations. They made a KILLING - estimates are between $6bn - $12bn on much less short interest.

&amp;#x200B;

This whole play was PORSCHE. PORSCHE decided when they wanted to take THEIR profits to benefit THEMSELVES. Fair Play. 

&amp;#x200B;

BUT what is happening right now, THIS is potentially a MASS redistribution of wealth that has NEVER been SEEN BEFORE. REMEMBER THIS!!! This isn't one company making massive profits at the expense of Wall Street, this is THE PEOPLE, fighting back...and WINNING.

&amp;#x200B;

NOBODY has to sell, but THEY have to BUY! Remember that. $1000 is not the end game, THEY will come again with their scare tactics but the line CAN be HELD, WE saw it FRIDAY.  ... See you on the moon.

&amp;#x200B;

Title: Download GameStop Mobile App == Help GME 
Alright listen up, in the last investor presentation \[1\], GME management specifically called out their updated Mobile App under **Catalysts for Future Growth** (Page 8).

They seem to be using the number of downloads and interactions with the App as a KPI (Key Performance Indicator for the Apes here) on Page 11.

I just checked on the Apple App Store and GameStop app is currently #60 in Shopping category. 

Even if you are dead broke and destitute from groud losses but still have a working smartphone, ***download the app and make an account***. Even ***that*** is helpful for some fuel ***even if you are not a GME holder.***

Why? Simple, getting an app more trending might lead others who are not on WSB to see it in the app store, pick it up, and use it as well. Gotta get this mobile app momentum up. 

Apes stong together.

Title: As promised, here is my  DD. I am fully prepared for . Bring it.
**Okay genius, weve heard the  saying crash imminent for years. Why should we listen?**

Truth be told, you probably shouldnt. I am a contrarian style investor, and I missed the contrarian signal in March, and entered the uptrend again way too late. If you read my post history, you will see a lot of bad calls and terrible advice (with hindsight, that is). That is why this is not investment advice in any shape or form. I am just as retarded as the next guy. I think, however, I might contribute some things that might not be common knowledge on WSB, and I really miss the good old DD posts amid the whole wsb-goes-vigilante-activist-investor vibe.

**Okay, I am retarded and can barely read. Give me some bullet points before I zone out?**

My main points:

 1.	The main narrative is way too one sided, and everyones a bull.

 a.	Remember when everyone was a bear back in March? Yeah, contrarian indicators are a thing. I missed it then and lost most of my gains from the ride down trying to call a top for the bulltrap.

 b.	USD shorts and treasury shorts are insanely large (historic record highs a couple of weeks ago), betting on a huge inflation spike any time now

 c.	Market euphoria and bullishness is also insanely high  all the bears have gone into hibernation.

 2.	Everyone believes money printing and stimulus creates growth and inflation, even though there is no proof of this happening in Japan, Europe, the US or anywhere else for the last 13 years.


 3.	Magic crayons and market fundamentals agree that this rally has gotten way ahead of itself.

 a.	There is a massive RSI divergence between the top back in Feb 2020 and the 2021 top.

  b.	Valuations are pricing in perfection for nearly every company for the foreseeable future.

**Okay, genius. Ive heard it all before. Jay Powell has our back, bulls have nothing to fear.**

Does he, really? The Wall Street narrative is dont fight the Fed, and it has become a self-fulfilling prophecy ever since the (in)famous Greenspan put. How many of you actually paid attention back in Feb-March? Jpow didnt just fire one bazooka and made everything fine. He needed multiple tries, and for a while there, the market did NOT care one bit what he did to rates or what insane number he pulled out of his ass for Super-QE. When the bears had exhausted themselves and passive flows started saving the day, the narrative changed into Fed saves the day, once again, and there was much rejoicing.

**But QE is creating a wave of liquidity, sloshing around, propping up stocks! The financial media told me so!**

As many of the less retarded members of this subreddit may have noticed by now, the financial media is not your friend, and they have no idea what theyre talking about most of the time. Its all talking points they get from their favorite Wall Street or Fed sources. 

What if I told you the whole money printing thing was just a lie? Because it is, and demonstrably so. Sure, the Federal Reserve prints money. They print physical money. The US currently has about 1.5 trillion, or roughly 7% or the M2 Money stock (M2 is what the Fed tries to tell you is the actual amount of US dollars in circulation).

So, what is QE, if its not money printing? QE is the central bank buying treasuries and other liquid assets from primary dealers. Do they pay for these with money? No. They credit the value in bank reserves, so the bank may lend against the value (which they already could when they held treasuries). So the entire world want US treasuries, one of the most liquid assets in the world, and one of the most popular assets for repo collateral. The primary dealers sell these assets to the central banks to secure their balance sheets and make room for More treasuries. What happens to the bank reserves? They stay in the central bank, and can be used as a basis for lending.

So  the banks can lend a lot more then  that means they lend money to hedge funds and other investors, and the money is put into markets! The Fed saved us after all! QE really works!! Well, [this graph](https://imgur.com/mvy8m8A) doesnt really fit that narrative. The massive spike in 2020 is companies maxing out their revolving loans to brace for impact. Like in 2008, lending has been negative every month since the height of the crisis.

Okay, so what if the Fed isnt really printing money. The government is clearly conjuring up money out of thin air and airdropping them to the people!

Well, they certainly are increasing their debt and spending the money on stimulus. I think the word is fairly misleading though. Are you stimulating spending if you give a homeless guy $10? Because that, for me, is the equivalent of what the government is doing. They are trying to prevent a disaster, not trying to stimulate growth. The gap between where we would have been without covid19 and where we actually is, is a lot bigger than a measly couple of trillion.
 
Some perspective on the recovery so far: https://imgur.com/OkJyOUi 

What the government is doing is trying to help people be a bit less miserable, not going out and boosting GDP to new heights. It sure doesnt seem like the money they are giving out is actually increasing consumer spending in either case: https://imgur.com/FsE9Tsv

**But, but Vaccines! Pent-up demand! Reflation! Dollar to zero!**

Vaccines are coming, and thank God for that. Is that really going to make the American economy explode (in a good way) though? It surely doesnt seem like it outside the stock market. Last summer everyone were talking about how amazing Q4 would be. In Q4 everyone were talking about how amazing 2021 would be. Now people are starting to realize that 2021 probably wont be so amazing after all, at least not until Q3-Q4. By the end of the summer, people will be talking about 2022. Noticed how nobodys talking about a V-shaped recovery anymore? A recovery would indicate that we got back to where we started, and even though we had insane numbers of a quarter, we are nowhere near where we started back in February (which was already quite anemic compared to pre-2008 growth):

Lastly, about that pent-up demand. I fail to see it. Leisure makes up roughly 6% of GDP. Sure, people will start eating out again, they will go to amusement parks, they will get haircuts and pedicures, but will you make up for what you didnt spend on it last year? 4 haircuts a month? 5 trips to Disney World? Eating out 8 days a week? The money has already been spent on RVs, computers, consoles, home remodeling and kitchen appliances. If anything, people might be spending less on these things than they did before covid. Evidence also points to Americans becoming more frugal and saving more to weather the next storm. I think reopening and vaccines will be a non-event.

**Okay, I got this far. Why now? Why cant we get SPY 400? 500?**
 
Warning. Magic crayons ahead. Consider yourself warned.

This is the S&amp;P back in 2018:

Notice how the RSI falls while the price increases? This is called divergence. It is considered a fairly reliable signal that something is amiss. The market made a new low, but the RSI didnt? Better sell your puts and consider buying calls. The market made a new high, but the RSI didnt? Vice versa. Some of you might happen what came next, but here is a picture:

Okay, not conviced? I get it. Here is the S&amp;P early last year:

I probably dont have to tell you what came next, but you can clearly see it on the final graph:

https://imgur.com/ASdHAtx

Notice anything else? Exactly. The market is soaring once again. The RSI? Not so much. Make of it what you will.
If you look closely at the last picture, you will see that the S&amp;P over the last week has gone from sitting comfortably on top of the 21 day moving average, to falling through. On Friday, we closed below the 50 day moving average. That was my cue for loading up  style. If we close above the 50d on Monday, I will cover and wait for another signal. I dont have the time to cover passive flows now, that will have to wait  what you need to know if you load up on short term puts, is to get rid of everything before Friday Feb 19. The last week of the month is not a good time to be a bear, because dumb money is buying every index.

Title: Understanding how GME got to &gt;100% short
Not only am I not a financial advisor, but my nurse just done wiping my shit covered ass and telling me what a good retard I am. This is not advice, I just like the stock.

Many on here keep asking how GME could have accumulated greater than 100% short interest. NAKED SHORTING!! Not so fast...there is a very legal and logical explanation HOW that could have happened BUT it doesnt change the fact it happened and GMC is still going to  because of it.

If one  lends one  to a  who then sells it to another  that means there is one shorted .

Now if second  borrows that same  from the second  and sells it to a third ...well guess what??  That same  has been shorted twice. This is how you can have that single  turn into two  on the short side

All debts must be paid and Melvin can suck my fat 

Class dismissed you mouth breathers. See ya Monday

Title: The Real Short Squeeze Catalyst - 4Q Earnings
The sole reason to hold GME longer than next week and next month are the 4Q earnings. According to Yahoo Finance GameStop is scheduled to report between 24-29 of **March.**

**Why wait until then?**

easy, usually short squeeze happens when there is a catalyst like acquisition, a new product announcement, or a surprise earning report. GME probably not going to buy or get bought out by someone and they won't announce a new product, but they will announce earnings 2 months from now that has a great chance to surprise EVERYONE.

**What do we know so far about their upcoming earnings?**

We only have information about their holiday sales:

* 4.8% increase in comparable stores sales YOY and 29.6% growth QOQ
* 309% increase in E-Commerce sales, representing 34% of total sales reaching $1.35B.
* Total sales declined 3.1% driven by an 11% decrease in the company store base.
* Australia and New Zealand sales increase 31%

Basically, GameStop closed 11% of the company stores, and still, total sales were down a minor 3.1% while comparable sales increased 4.8%. This means 2 things:

1. Physical stores are still profitable or performing very well.
2. E-Commerce Sales are now making up for the loss of sales of closed stores, leading the way for e-commerce being the main company revenue stream.
3. Covid free countries like Australia and New Zealand are still buying from GameStop helping it penetrate these huge markets.

GME on the 3Q report said that they expect positive comparable sales (which we just saw are probably going to be positive) and finally being profitable.

The key here is PROFITABILITY. GME was profitable only 3 times in the last 12Q ([https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/net-income](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/net-income)).

In the last 2Q that GME achieved profitability the stock went up:

[https://ibb.co/ZJCG9hJ](https://ibb.co/ZJCG9hJ)

27.3.20 was the day of announcement:

[https://ibb.co/8Pkx53L](https://ibb.co/8Pkx53L)

The stock gapped up a whopping **16%** before going down.

11.6.19 was another profitable Q announcement:

The stock gapped up 8.5% after earnings.

**Why is it matter?**

well if the next earning report will be a good surprise we will see the price move up the next day and if the company will show a clear path of profitability for the next years **THE SHORT THESIS WILL BE GONE AND A SHORT SQUEEZE WILL FOLLOW**

The odds of profitability are very high with the management expecting it and E-Commerce sales booming. I conclusion HOLD TILL EARNINGS DONT SALE!!!!!!!!

**TL;DR:** The squeeze will happen when there will be a catalyst, the only catalyst for GME is earnings at the end of March, so hold tight until then and let's get the moneyyyyy

Positions: 141 stocks at 14$ average price 

Title: The $GME squeeze will bring down Melvin. The Silver squeeze will bring down the biggest banks in the world. That's why Robinhood barred trading of $SLV the day after they took a billion dollars in loans from JPM and Goldman Sachs. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME.
You retarted apes are growing up. I remember a year ago this sub was nothing but memes of J-Powell littered with rocketship emojis. Now It's GME posts littered rocketship emojis. We've come so far. 

Now listen:

If you think Wall Street is shitting their pants over the GME short squeeze you are 100% right. Jim Bianco lays out a [convincing case](https://www.financialsense.com/podcast/19847/jim-bianco-gamestop-and-great-short-seller-takedown#.YBTK3GAFZmU.twitter) that SPY was down 2% on Friday because hedge funds were dropping their "safe" stocks to raise capital for collateral against their rising margin debt on GME. 

But you also got to know this. At the same moment Robinhood halted purchases of GME, after calls from their hedge fund buddies, they also put on limits on $SLV. 

([Here is the list of all limited stocks](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/) \- they've since added weird stuff like Starbucks, but $SLV was one of the first along with $GME and $AMC). I think that's pretty weird, considering that, unlike these other stocks, $SLV was up only a few percent on Thursday. It's even weirder when you consider that Robinhood had just been [bailed out by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/robinhood-is-said-to-draw-on-credit-lines-from-banks-amid-tumult?sref=rY0z5sRB)! These fuckers are two of the worst silver manipulators out there. (Seriously. Link for [Goldman](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bank-nova-divestiture-goldman-sachs-idUSKBN1DS2C5). Link for [JPM](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html))

These banks have been raking it in on suppressing the price of silver for  decades. Look at this historical chart of silver. Does this make any sense? Silver was well over $30 for several years in the ***fucking 1980s.*** And now it's $27???

&amp;#x200B;

The fair price of silver, conservatively is CERTAINLY over $50, but it seems that there were some strings attached to JPM and GS's little loan to Robinhood. 

I'm balls deep in GME, but am riding this silver train too. Already last week $AG and $SLV were surging despite Robinhood's best efforts. If this thing breaks, both of those tickers will at least double. My personal price target for Silver is $70. The tendies from silver will be extra sweet for me  - nothing like breaking up the greatest cartel in modern history (apologies to OPEC). 

Keep fighting the good fight apes. We'll bring these bastards to their knees. 

My positions: $GME shares, $AG and $SLV shares and July calls.

Title: Let's talk about $INTC, let's talk about $AMD 
TL;DR This autist likes $AMD.

I've held AMD since November 2015 (@$1.94) and have weathered these speculative downturns many times. IMO the latest downturn is driven purely by an anticipated return to greatness due to Gelsinger's return. This confidence in Gelsinger is greatly misplaced for two reasons:

1. Gelsinger may be better than Intels past 3 dipshit ceos, but he's no Andy Grove. Gelsinger's retarded baby was Itanium, which AMD handily beat with x86_64.

2. Even if Intel burried Andy Fucking Grove in a Pet Semetary it would take years for him to turn that steaming turd of a company around. Serioulsy retards, look at AAPL when Steve Jobs returned in July 1997. The stock peaked briefly in 2000 before quickly tanking again. It took the goddam legendary Steve Jobs 5 years to achieve a sustained turn around at AAPL.

Title: Silver demand is already skyrocketing
With Bidens green revolution, well be seeing an even higher demand for solar panels, electric vehicles, and many more products that require it. Given that theres already a shortage, its the perfect time to squeeze and teach JP Morgan and COMEX whos boss.

The best things to do is buy futures and demand physical delivery. There are hundreds of times more paper silver traded than physical silver. Most of them are cash settled, but if we demanded the physical asset we could cause them to default and send the value of silver skyrocketing to its fair value.

For most of the ancient world the daily wage of an average worker was 1/10 an ounce of silver. Today that costs around $2.7...

Title: BB response write up;
Perfectly stated [u/Tradergurue](https://new.reddit.com/user/Tradergurue/).

This is a long winded comment That I wanted to post at  [u/Tradergurue](https://new.reddit.com/user/Tradergurue/) [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short\_interest\_in\_bb\_its\_increasing/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short_interest_in_bb_its_increasing/) DD write up.

&amp;#x200B;

BB to the moon obviously; in response heres why:

 Agreed on every word you said. long hold here. extremely undervalued relative to other companies that are "security". 

What i like the most. is that they are entrenched in so many areas other than "security". Their IOT and space within space (literal aerospace)  will be IMO what will cause the "hype" this year (maybe next year 2022) and or "speculative growth" that will propel them to easily double digits. 

I mean just thinking "security" competitors. Which aren't actually competitors because its not apples to apples industry. Competitors like CRWD and NET have 5X'd and 8X'd this year alone. 

I did a personal analysis to calculate the price of BB.  Comparing various companies in similar industries market cap, sales, price, and speculative growth (this is the most variable of course) of over a dozen companies today. It shows that today (that this year, however could be going into 2022)  BB should be at least at $80 a share. This number IMO is conservative. 

If I have to wait a whole year (perhaps 1-2 years as mentioned above). I will. Stocks and Leaps for me are the way. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: The last few weeks: Given this momentum and volume trading, WSB (and the world getting in) may push for this noise in marketing and pushing this stock to 80 easy by years end. This stock is very "meme"able and it has a lot of sentiment (from boomers and millennials alike) and future speculation that the could propel it. Any easy youtube video will describe "QNX", meme's could be easily assigned to "john chen" its CEO (he too btw has stock bonus incentives like a musk) could easily by WSB's new "sue bae", or dadda chen or something sticky. Once more media starts treating BB more seriously with the help of WSB, it will stay higher in price (never again trading at below 10 ...or even 5 as a penny stock lol), and these next few weeks may yield that. lets see..

TLDR;

BB to the moon,

Title: Theory of Current Market Conditions (DD)
**TL;DR** High short % stocks are **nuclear bombs** going off that are sucking capital out of the market into the mushroom clouds that are currently ascending into the stratosphere. Read further for more details on this retarded theory.

**Disclaimer**: Im retarded and have been wrong in the past. This is fan fiction and fairy tales **not financial or investment advice**.

So during the last 2 weeks our wonderful subreddit blew up and is now pretty much known by every person on the fucking planet. I've looked at what is happening overall in the market vs what is happening in the high short % stocks during that time. I've selected a 2 week timeline because I believe during this time everyone on the market (including hedge funds) have discovered what's moving these stocks.

Here's the figures since January 19th (18th markets were closed). I've included the most popular high short % stocks since they're what retail investors (we) seem to be buying with our mouths foaming. I apologize if I left out your favourite meme stock, fuck you, keep reading it's about to get more interesting.

**Timeline: January 19th - January 29th**

High short interest stocks:

GME +680%
AMC +330%
LGND +47% 
SPWR +46%
SPCE +40%
BBBY +35%
FUBO +30%

Even half blind smooth brains can see they are all mooning. But why are GME and AMC outperforming the rest? We'll come back to them later. Next up is looking at the performance of other shit on the market. I've tried to select large cap stocks and indices that are relevant to the situation, you retards can go and look up the rest and **prove me wrong.**

**Timeline: January 19th - January 29th** 

Selected stocks &amp; indices:

S&amp;P 500 -2,2%
NASDAQ -0,5%
AAPL +3,2%
MSFT +8,5%
FB +0,5%
TSLA -5,2%
GOOGL +2,4%

What's interesting about this you say? Everything seems  normal, they're mostly flat, who the fuck cares right? You would be right, during the 2 week timeline things look pretty normal.

Now let's look what has happened since **shit hit the fan** on Thursday (28th) after Robinhood started to limit the buys on meme stocks and **EVERYONE** started to talk about wsb and retail investors hunting stocks with high short %.

**Timeline: January 28th - January 29th**

Selected stocks &amp; indices:

S&amp;P 500 -1,14%
NASDAQ -2%
AAPL -5,3%
MSFT -1,8%
FB -7,3%
TSLA -2,5%
GOOGL -0,5%

Everything is red. Why is that weird? For one FB, MSFT, AAPL actually **all beat earnings** released last week (TSLA missed). Why are investors not piling onto these stocks? There's multiple reasons and here's where the **nuclear bomb theory** comes into picture. I suggest you put on your cloak and wizard hat it's about to get retarded.

I believe the smart money realized what's about to happen and are exiting their long positions. By smart money I'm referring to hedge funds like Melvin Capital who are losing $3B a month. Even you degenerates here have exited your other positions and YOLO'd into GME and AMC. As many people here with IQ above 80 have earlier stated a lot of these hedge funds are piled onto the same long and short positions. The biggest short positions they're in are most likely all in the red because the short squeeze frenzy happening. They're scared shitless over the idea they might be caught in a situation like Melvin where they need to be bailed out by buddies or even worse, go tits up. Some of them saw this earlier and probably were smart enough to cover and close their shorts. Some of them have not covered or even worse may have doubled down on shorts. Since last Thursday these clowns have a planet full of  retards bidding up their short positions.

I believe to avoid blowing up their chad funds, on Thursday and Friday they started to liquidate their long positions to be able to cover the short positions. What happens when a bunch of these suits start exiting at the same time? It tanks the stock (which I believe is happening to AAPL, MSFT, FB and many others, possibly the whole market). This leads to a cycle where even more funds want to liquidate long positions because suddenly they're losing money on the shorts (mooning) and longs (tanking). Remember these people are leveraged **TO THE TITS** so in an event where they're losing on all fronts they may be forced to liquidate positions to avoid margin calls.

Moving capital from their longs to cover their short positions will make things **even worse** for the not so smart funds that have not yet covered. High short % stocks will moon even harder due to other funds covering and the boomer long positions they are in will drill down even more. 

In this situation GME and AMC are **Little Boy** and **Fat Man** (read your history kids). They are the first and the second **Nuclear Bomb** to drop. They will suck all the surrounding capital into a mushroom cloud ascending into the stratosphere. Why are GME and AMC blowing up especially bigly? Because they do shit even your 90 year old grandma can understand. Depending how the situation evolves, other high short % stocks may or may not join them in their ride to the heavens (my opinion is they will be duds). I'm seeing a lot of turmoil in the upcoming weeks, look at what happened to VIX last week.

Positions: Cash gang, GME  and SPY FDs

Hope you all have a great weekend!

Also, 

Title: Market cap weighted ETFs will be forced to buy GME soon.
My theory is that shorts aren't going to give up, expecting a dump next week. Then next week. Then next week...

It doesn't happen. At this point, months have gone on. GME no longer rises 100% a day, but is much higher than it is now. 

Algo bots have at this point classified the stock as trading with high valuation. They buy the dips. People still refuse to sell. Shorts haven't given up, thinking any dip is a good time to short.

Could really see this happening. Not concerned about it dumping anytime soon. If it does, it's probably MM shorting the entire float again.

Title: #Common Sense GME DD.  This DD is so obvious it's easily overlooked and any smooth brain can understand.
https://fintel.io/so/us/gme

This DD needs a lot more attention. 

Ima keep this simple. The following DD posted by u/fyzle deserves more attention than it's been getting. It's simple, clear and common sense. 

Basically, about 30% of GME shares are owned by just 3 investment firms (Blackrock, Fidelity, Vanguard). Another 30% is own by other investment firms and Ryan Cohen, which brings it to over 60%... all of who have a vested interest in seeing GME moon.

If you think for one second that Blackrock, the world's largest investment fund, is going to let GME fail then you must be literally retarded. 

They do not lose money. Period. 

Citadel, Melvin and Citron are nothing compared to the might of just Blackrock alone. Throw in Fidelity, Vanguard, Schwab, Susquehana Capital and a bunch of others (see link), and you quickly realize that shorts don't have a leg to stand on. 

Autists prepare for take off.

GME to the mothafuckin moon!

Title: $GME Endgame - Game Theory &amp; Best Scenarios
For those confused why BUY and HOLD are the investors best strategy - both to stick it to hedge funds and profit - this post is to map this out.

**HEDGEFUND RISK**

First understand what's at risk for the hedge funds.  [According to S3 analytics,](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/gamestop-short-sellers-are-still-not-surrendering-despite-nearly-20-billion-in-losses-this-year.html) HFs have lost $20B on $GME so far.  Other reports have come out that [hedge funds have lost 15-20% of assets](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/dan-sundheim-s-20-billion-d1-capital-loses-about-20-this-month#:~:text=Dan%20Sundheim's%20D1%20Capital%20Partners,target%20hedge%20funds'%20favorite%20positions) so far this year.  Using these two numbers we can make an estimate they have $80B at stake here ([Citadel was worth $33B on Jan. 1st](https://www.citadel.com/about-citadel/#:~:text=We%20achieve%20far%20more%20together%20than%20we%20ever%20could%20on%20our%20own.&amp;text=Citadel%20named%20to%20Linkedin's%20Top,as%20of%20January%201%2C%202021) so I believe this to be close).  Because Citadel and Melvin struck a deal, we can assume they are all in this together.  This prevents a [prisoners dilemma](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prisoners-dilemma.asp#:~:text=The%20prisoner's%20dilemma%20is%20a,expense%20of%20the%20other%20participant) for any one of them and makes retail investors battle $80B vs. say an individual worth $2B.

Now let's assume short amount is 100% of float and they have reduced the high debt on Thursday's shady tactics.  This means to calculate daily interest we take:

* 50M shares in float ([according to Fin Viz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME))
* 25% interest rate = .25/365 = .07%/day
* Share Price = $300

$300\*.07\*50M = $10.2M in interest/day.  

At $300 share price and $80B in funds as long as they continue to acquire the minimum # of shares needed they can keep this up for ***21 years.***

*So that's their situation.  The question they are asking then is how do we improve our situation and ensure we gather enough shares to keep this going?*

&amp;#x200B;

**HEDGEFUND GAME THEORY**

Ok so now assume you are a huge asshole that steals from poor people and has no respect for others.  You need ***shares*** and ***you want to exit your position so you can make money elsewhere****.*  How do you do this?

There are three tactics likely:

1) Settlement

* Let's go back to our shares needed (50M) and value of the hedge funds ($80B).  Dividing that out we see that if they pay $1600/share they would be bankrupt.
* To avoid bankruptcy but get out they likely will look for government intervention that has them pay $500-$1000/share
* So how would you do this?  You first use your friends to [convince retail investors that your share is worth less than $1K](https://twitter.com/realwillmeade/status/1355329408194719748).  Retail investors might even have an organization like [SEC say they are protecting us](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/sec-vows-protect-retail-investors-amid-gamestop-frenzy-n1256146) \- after all $500/share is more than retail investors paid.  You then settle behind the scenes with your cronies and come out with PR about how great this is! *(fuckers)*
* This is their best course of action because retail investors cannot do jack shit against it

&amp;#x200B;

2A) Test Pricing - Low

* The first test they did was to see if they could scare us.  A [ladder attack](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l72r36/what_is_a_short_ladder_attack/) costs them nothing.  And if they keep price low enough they don't have to pay out on higher issued options.  
* Clearly the ladder attack was very effective Thursday and Friday up until \~2:30pm (I'll explain why later).  I expect them to use this as needed to keep price in a range

&amp;#x200B;

2B) Test Pricing - High

* Another strategy is to find a [price cliff](https://www.pricebeam.com/pricingpsychology#:~:text=A%20Price%20Cliff%20can%20be,share%20and%20revenue%20will%20drop).  Essentially they let price run up a bit and hope that everyone sells to lock in profits.  This is more risky and will be used cautiously.
* However I can't state this enough - **we might see price rise substantially on Monday in hopes that retail investors sell.**

&amp;#x200B;

3) Work with GME to Issue Shares

* If they think buying is dying down, a share issuance allows them to grab a number of these shares and exit
* The reason this is not their best outcome is twofold: Retail investors can help subdue with a huge buy attack and GME has little incentive to upset a large portion of retail investors
* Still, keep your eyes out for this to happen as it will be a pivotal point

&amp;#x200B;

Well this all sounds good and I need to get back to my yacht.  Let's do some price testing and call up our buddies to solve this in a couple weeks.  This can't go tits up.

*Wrong.  Retail Investors still have the power.*

&amp;#x200B;

**RETAIL INVESTOR GAME THEORY**

So now you are a smooth-brained ape.  What can you do to stick it to the twats?

1) HOLD

* If everyone holds then HFs can't get shares.  This leads to a long, drawn out fight or settlement.  But guess what - at least the HFs are losing millions of $s a day and unable to screw around with other stocks
* This benefits the new retail investors because eventually your short-term gains become long-term gains (less taxes)

2) BUY 

* How do you prevent a wall of selling slowly lowering the price?  You build a wall of buying slowly raising the price!
* Whether you realize it or not retail investors almost lost Friday afternoon. RIs had two days where buying was diminished (fuck Robinhood) and therefore the ladder attack let HFs set whatever price they needed.  Thankfully retail investors pulled it off in the final minutes (maybe thanks to a whale)
* If retail investors continue to commit limit order buys to prevent the ladder attack from lowering price AND continue to adjust their limit order buys UP the price will go UP
* ***This is the most important though - the retail investor must commit to the idea that there is no longer a "dip".***  ***Price is now pre-squeeze and post-squeeze***
* If they can do this the retail investor wins.  The post-squeeze price will be where most retail investors want to sell (hopefully VERY HIGH) and all shares purchased post-squeeze will make profit

3) FIND WHALES

* Anyone named Elon that wants to commit to the cause and also hates short sellers?

4) DO IT QUICKLY

* HFs are spending 24/7 trying to find a way out.  The longer RIs let this drag on the longer a settlement is likely

&amp;#x200B;

**RETAIL INVESTOR WINNING - WHAT TO EXPECT**

Now that we understand that what will winning look like?  Well we have two outcomes:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Successful Buy Wall Overwhelms The Shorts

* This could literally happen tomorrow with enough power
* The price will gamma squeeze, then squeeze, and then game is over
* Watch for massive market dips 

&amp;#x200B;

2) Retail Investors Own All The Shares

* While unlikely there could be a situation where everyone is HOLDING and shorts can't get their shares
* A ladder attack will lower the price to get retail investors to sell  - imagine a slow steady drop to $20/share
* After waiting it out a month or two eventually the HFs fold and a real buy and a real ask will go through at whatever the retail investors deem the share price to be (again hopefully VERY HIGH)

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

* Hedge funds want to drag this out waiting for a settlement or retail investors to sell
* The retail investors best strategy is to BUY and HOLD.  
* A successful retail investor strategy ***eliminates the idea that their is "a dip" to create a buying wall.***  There is only pre-squeeze and post-squeeze prices.
* A buying wall - supported by a swath of limited order buys - by the retail investor will move price up slowly day after day until this over
* One well-intentioned whale could end this tomorrow if they really cared
* Don't be surprised to see a settlement with the SEC come through for $1000/share or less

Title: BB closes on Friday CHEAP
Due to profit taking and RH restricting buying BB shares, BB has dropped from a high of 28 down to 14. GME has been dominating this sub lately, and for good reason, but if you haven't read about BB, check out some previous posts like these ones:

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2c4dh/blackberry_bb_dd_why_bb_is_mooning_and_heading_to/

This is more a long term play, but I would guess that it will bounce back up in the short term. Also, do consider that eventually GME will squeeze or burn, and I think BB will be a stock that many here will flock to. It has huge potential and is similar to GME in that they are in the process of changing their business model around and have new deals and huge potential.

This is not financial advice, invest at your own discretion

Title: Some AAPL DD for you retards
Alright retards and autists, listen up. AAPL earnings were last week and they were spectacular, sales up 21% YOY, SMASHED 100 billion in revenue in one quarter for the first time ever at 111.4 billion, sales in all product categories are up double digit percentage points and bassicaly crushed the revenue estimates for every one of their product categories aside from being under by 0.01% for mac revenue (mac revenue still up 21% YOY). Earnings per share were at $1.68 vs the estimated $1.41. It's also important to note that sales in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan are up 57%.

But what happened? You ask, like a wide eyed retard fresh outta mommies cunt. We've all seen this shit before, blowout earning report and a steep sell of straight afterwards. It's why only the retardiest of retards play earnings. They almost always recover after said sell off and If you look at the chart, apple is prime for a swift recovery judging by the Extremely bullish Batman throwing a batarang pattern that developed in the last few hours on friday.

https://imgur.com/gallery/KCjZdbZ

The reason I believe the recovery wil be swift is because this sell off was almost certainly caused by a few big funds needing liquidity to cover their GME shorts + short more GME. Also autists liquidating their positions to buy more gme. This dip will be bought right back up by institutions that have no interest in GME.

TLDR; AAPL going back over 140 by the end of next week cuz I said so.

Postions: AAPL FEB 05 140c , AAPL MAR 05 145c

Title: Whales to Watch: Week of 2/1  
In the interest of consistency, and because everybody needs to be chipping in right now, heres the scans that caught my eye today heading into next week. Mondays are my best days so Ill have way more then, EOD.

**Overall, whales kept betting on tech to bounce back heavily**, in convincing style (signals that indicated the call blocks were more than just hedging). Image links are call blocks from each. 

[FB](https://i.imgur.com/A0R2dz2.jpg) : until the bitter end today, people were feverishly pumping call blocks with puts aligning them. If tech bounces back, FB in particular is due for a rip after correcting post-earnings

[SQ](https://i.imgur.com/40VDFnM.jpg) : consistent bullish call volume all week. People thought they fished the bottom yesterday but got curbed by the blood red index day

[DKNG](https://i.imgur.com/wapFAGh.jpg) : lots of sporadic call clusters like this. PENN gets most of the glory, but there are a lot of catalysts coming around state regulations soon. Load up some 2/26 and wait for the pop

[AMZN](https://i.imgur.com/bfCXbJj.jpg) : the bulls are buying calls heavily in anticipation of earnings. If you think you know what a good beat is, just wait for AMZN Christmas results

BONUS: sporadic FDX call orders have come in. After an oversell for FDX recently, AMZN sympathy is plausible based on orders.

[INTC](https://i.imgur.com/F2SUHPy.jpg)  : yes. I know INTC can be awful. But tons of pump since the ER. they have a new CEO everyone is excited about now, and look to have found a bottom. I like this.

**Tech grab bag:**

**ZNGA PINS CRM SNAP FSLY**

 **All HEAVY volume and look great for ERs coming off this tech drubbing.** Very bullish call flow.

Hope this gives you some confirmation bias or ideas to look into.

**Inbox always open**: i was super busy this past week, but in light of recent crazy market/WSB events I will be checking frequently and am willing to bounce ideas, field questions.

*TLDR: Buy tech calls, because whales richer than you are doing just that. *

good luck. 

Title: Light GME DD - how much money (and how many shares) the HFs/MMs lost yesterday on ITM 1/29 Calls because we held $320
Hello degenerates, I was interested to see how many shares changed hands and how much gain/loss 1/29 ITM calls created for buyers/sellers after GME closed at $325.00 yesterday. I took Nasdaq data on OI (for the newbies, that's open interest - numbers of contracts out there in the market) for each strike ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain)) and calculated the value at expiration (\[closing price - strike price\] \* 100 shares/contract \* OI = total gain/loss those positions generated). Sorry if you can't do math or read ( APES TOGEHTER STRONNG).

Summary Table:

[$1.6B loss for call writers and 9.2M volume](https://preview.redd.it/lxj9n4k2cie61.png?width=230&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6302bf8cfb4af67adeb99075f2b53f841060a1a6)

Current float is like 50.65M ([https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME)) so that means if 9.25M shares get assigned, 18% of float will now change hands as a result.

Here's the data visualized if you're interested to see where waves of call buying happened (OI on left vertical axis, $ total Gain/Loss for call buyers/sellers on right):

Title: DD: Why the play on SLV is a mistake. (HEAR ME OUT).
[deleted]

Title: WOOF? I think so. Potential deep value.
Speaking of deep value, I'm finding it in WOOF after a deep dive this morning. Off topic I know, but it's 1/8th the valuation of CHWY with very similar market shares (approx. 5-6%) and revenues ($4B-$5B range) as of the end of 2020. Chewy is definitely growing faster rn no doubt. However, the WOOF CEO started in 2018 and came from HPQ. HPQ and its stock performed very well while he was el presidente; it actually seems to be dropping quite a bit ever since he left. He was definitely blindsided by the pandemic in orchestrating the turnaround. Long term debt is the elephant in the room, but the IPO will cover a portion of it, and the turnaround will take care of the rest.  I like the omnichannel focus, the brick and mortar footprint (bc of vet services) coming out of the pandemic, and a tech oriented CEO. If they can make big inroads with marketing and customer service, they will be on equal footing with CHWY. Lots of other factors of course, but I like the stock and the opportunity for a turnaround given the $97B TAM.

Wish there were 2022/23 leaps available. Only goes out to September rn. Anyway, I'll be buying deep ITM September calls and a sizable shares position.

Title: Short interest in $BB - It's increasing

While the information provided is believed to be accurate, it may include errors or inaccuracies.)*  


**In this DD I will highlight how the short float % has been increasing over time in BB.**   


[Short float &amp;#37; - Latest data from https:\/\/fintel.io\/ss\/us\/bb ](https://preview.redd.it/sclkg9ivshe61.png?width=2546&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae126d58d0126fd86b28f80ce22eb5f81f4b358f)

As can be seen in this picture, the short float % has been steadily increased over time as the price continues to go up. This could indicate that the shorts have been losing a ton of money, and is now trying to double down. However, this is nowhere near GME or AMC levels but could increase a lot more over time as seen in how much the short volume has increased these last couple of days. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Short volume interest - Latest data from https:\/\/fintel.io\/ss\/us\/bb ](https://preview.redd.it/p7urdnrjuhe61.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99c6f6397db19891afddf34baff974d7269385c9)

As seen in this picture you can clearly see that the short volume has been increasing over time, and will most likely have an effect on how much the short float % currently is. Since the latest data for the short float % is from the 15th of January, we would have to wait for the 9th of February to see newly updated data on the short float %. 

  
The question is now, will they keep shorting BB into oblivion as they did with GME and AMC?   


**It's also important to look at the options flow and the possibility of a gamma squeeze.**  

[Graph from: u\/Strig1 ](https://preview.redd.it/dkcek800whe61.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9388763aca6f8fa1109d460f6831034d107242b)

This week we saw something that very well could have been manipulation of the price based upon how many calls that would expire ITM of the price was above $30. They kept the price under $15 to let all these contracts expire OTM. But how does the options table looks like next week? See picture below

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/BB\/options\/](https://preview.redd.it/ra9imjdzwhe61.png?width=1320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3e8fa9c42368fc23590bd56ef2d8875385d137d)

As seen in this picture there are far fewer calls OTM next week compared to this week. So I would think that the stock price has a better chance of moving higher this week. However the possibility of a Gamma squeeze next week is small but if the price can get above $25 there is a chance to see a push upwards due to call sellers buying back shares to cover.   


# And of course BB 

Edit: Im not here to distract people from GME, but Im just trying to highlight what these HFs are doing, by showing how they just continue to short companies with potential like BB.

Title: Have you stopped to consider why Fidelity and Vanguard didn't block trading on Thursday?
Vanguard and Fidelity (combined with Blackrock) own 33.9% of all GME shares. Make no mistake, they refused to block it not because they are "the good guys". They did not block it because they like money and they'd like to see their competition go under.

Make no mistake - if there is in fact collusion going on behind the scenes, you can be certain that Citadel and the others are doing everything in their power to get these 3 "good guys" to help them out.

Be careful retards. 33.9% of shares is plenty of ammo to move markets against us.

Title: This is America: A bagholder story
As we sit in front of our computers this weekend, urgently refreshing wallstreetbets in a desperate search for that dopamine high, that sweet sweet confirmation bias that what we just did, YOLOing all our money into GME was the right thing to do, its time to take a moment to consider how unprotected are tight innocent assholes are, and who make try and strip us of that innocence.

It is already clear from this week that hedge funds will not go down without a fight, and why should we have expected any less. There is FUD, market manipulation, smear campaigns against us, and paid bots and shilling diversions, just more ways to get your small peasant brain to chase after the next shiny object like the plebian shit-class untouchable you are to them. So what is there to consider?

**The Fundamentals remain unchanged**

Short float is still sitting at 120% and new shorts waiting to profit off of the end drop of the squeeze are coming on board every day. THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF NEW SHORTS. This is great news in one way. The short squeeze still has the potential to blow up. You still have the potential to make fat TENDIES.

1. **DFV is still in **
2. **Both sides are still in **
3. **IM STILL MOTHERFUCKING IN**.** **

**Hedge funds are just as retarded as us**

Are you seriously going to believe that the people running the markets are not just as fucking stupid and arrogant. They have been winning for decades. They think we are marks and have no problem doubling their position in spite of us. They will make fatal flaws that will eventually pay off in the form of a short squeeze once they cant bear the interest.

SO HOW CAN WE GET SCREWED?

There are a number of unprecedented ways this whole scenario can go fucking sideways that you should always be aware of.

1. **We are no longer Us vs Citadel - THE SEC HALTS TRADING ON GME FOR A WEEK OR MONTH**

The world is watching, politicians are watching, other hedge funds, and retards all over the globe. Most important the SEC and the US government is watching. This has almost become a social movement, and the MOMENT it shifts from a good deal and fundamentals in the market to a social movement to fuck over the market and hedge funds the SEC will step in to protect the market.

This is because of our own weight, people joining on because they see the hype against hedge funds and not understanding the market principles behind why a short squeeze will happen.

THERE IS ALREADY PEOPLE CALLING FOR A WEEK OR MONTH LONG HALT TO PROTECT THE MARKET FROM A SOCIAL MOVEMENT. THE SEC DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU.

YELLEN TOOK NEARLY A MILLION IN SPEAKING FEES FROM CITADEL. SHE IS NOT ON YOUR SIDE. She cant overtly help citadel because that would be collusion but she has enough dick swing to make a freeze on both sides that would cool the momentum off on our side, and give the other side enough time to increase their covers.

2. **The players have changed**

Nobody has to disclose what short percentage they are holding. There are so many new shorts that we don't know if it is still Melvin, Citadel, or a completely new set of players at a much higher short position. I highly doubt the original players are still holding their worst short positions and if they have dropped those and put themselves in a much higher short level, the price in which we need to bring GME will increase drastically in order for them to feel the pressure.

Citadel is a FUCKING PRO, they are very fucking likely on both sides of this trade. If you don't believe they are already holding long positions, dumping their most dangerous short positions, and intending to make money UP the squeeze and DOWN the squeeze you are deluded to how hedge funds work. The smartest players play both sides.

3. **The government steps in and bails out the shorts**

This is not going to be a 2008 scenario where you all get a fat payday from daddy USA riding in a white fucking unicorn. There are people all over the world long GME and the gov would never just hand you a payout at whatever price you want. It will look like back door incentives to reduce their position. It will be behind closed doors and the percentage of the profit you will see from this will be low as fuck.

4. **Gamestop itself is forced to dilute its shares**

This is the absolutely worst-case scenario, with one fell swoop the short % would shrink below 100, the risk of a squeeze would deflate, the price would get diluted, and cause a run on GME and its collapse. This would save hedge funds and wipe everyone long GME out.

They cant do this? Don't fucking delude yourself, the government can and will strong-arm Gamestop to do whatever the fuck it feels is best to diffuse the situation if it feels like this will have an impact on the overall market.

&amp;#x200B;

Get your fucking shit together and play the same game they are playing.

**Want to stop the SEC from fucking you?** Write letters to the SEC, Write letters to your congressmen, the governer, Joe fucking biden himself.

**Want to stick it to Melvin capital and hedge funds?** Go protest outside Zuccotti park and have the same nothing effect as the OCCUPY movement had. This GME play is SOLELY because WE LIKE THE STOCK AND THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE GOOD. WE ARE NOT A SOCIAL MOVEMENT and if thats why you are here you are fucking stupider than Melvin himself.

**Want to mentally prepare yourself for the worst? - If you're a little bitchmade paper handed pussy who will cry when you get margin called or bankrupted then reduce your fucking position asap. The people YOLOing millies here are either LOSS VETERANS or doing their DD. ACCEPT YOU MAY LOSE IT ALL AND REMEMBER THIS IS FUCKING AMERICA WE ARE TALKING ABOUT.**

Ps. I am not a financial advisor or american, but Gamestop is and this whole thing can go sideways in ways you may have not thought of.

Title: PSA: Robinhood Users - MODS PLEASE DON'T DELETE
**TLDR: I see a lot of talk about moving and less walk.  I believe that is partly due to misinformation about the ease of switching so please read if this applies to you.**  

Let me start by saying the following: People can sell when they want, buy when they want, and I have no agenda here regarding that.  I also don't work for any other platform and I really don't care which one you move to, if you move at all.  I have read dozens of posts from Robinhood users (I am not a user of their platform) that range from mild displeasure to full-on outrage.  I have read far fewer posts, however, about people actually initiating the process of moving to a better online brokerage option.  There are several but first let's cover some basics so that you are fully informed on how easy it is.  If you had started the process of moving on Thursday when you should have you'd probably be ready by Tuesday/Wednesday of this week so don't delay any further!

**I Read Three Main Concerns, Each I will Briefly Address:**

1. Users think they have to sell their holdings first.  THAT IS FALSE.
2. Users think they can only use one platform.  THAT IS FALSE.
3. Users think the process is difficult or other brokerages cost money.  THAT IS FALSE.

**You Do NOT Have To Sell Anything:** Online brokerages gain and lose clients all the time and anything a transfer occurs it is VERY simple.  I'm finding this aspect of the posts so confusing because it's just as easy to open a new account online at any of the "Big Boy" brokerages as it is with Robinhood.  You simply go online, answer questions, and generally your account is open right away!  Next you'll need to fund the new account which you can do in several ways or a combo of a few.  You can link the new account to a checking/savings account you have with a bank, you can transfer assets (UNSOLD) from an old account your new one, and usually one or two other options.  I believe the term for transferring holdings from one brokerage to another is **"Like Kind Transfer"** but if I'm wrong and somebody can correct me I will edit this post.  Essentially, if you own shares in many stocks or shares in just one stock the old brokerage simply transfers them to the new one.  

It would be good to have the routing and account number handy from any account you wish to bring money from too.  If you don't know this simply call your bank first thing Monday morning and ask.  Or go to a branch.  Or go look at the bottom of a check you have and find them there (Google which number is which so you get it right).

**You Can Have Multiple Accounts With Different Brokerages:**  An easier option may simply be to open a new account over the weekend with a different brokerage, get the funds transfer started ASAP, and as soon as the money is there then you can start buying whatever you want from your new account.  You can own *X number* of shares of a company in Robinhood and *Y number* of shares in that same company with a different brokerage.  This is generally what I find my peers to be doing (I'm considered of boomer age by the WSB population) and there are actually a number of reasons to do this.  I think in light of events from this week that point should be self-evident.

**This Process Could Not Be Easier, And Ironically Robinhood (&amp; Others) Applied Pressure Years Ago And Now Most Accounts Have Free Trading:**  That's right, my boomer Vanguard account used to charge a commission for me to buy/sell stock.  Now it is free!  Similarly the commission on options has come down.  Robinhood tricked you into thinking they were doing something different or better.  They actually weren't and certainly now they aren't.

CAVEAT: Vanguard's app sucks.  Some of the other grown-up brokerages apps are better and I've never used Robinhood (but I've seen a million screen shots) and it seems that Robinhood and similar brokerages did design easier platforms, especially mobile-based platforms.  ***HOWEVER, when you've got thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of dollars at stake I'm dumbfounded why a user wouldn't want something LESS basic.***

The transfer may cost you $75 at most (from what I'm reading) but I think the move would be worth it.  But as I wrote above, if you don't want to transfer then just open a new account and keep two open.  One that treats you like shit and tells what you're allowed to do with your money and a new one that appreciates your business and allows you to do whatever you want.  Not sure the choice should be hard here.

**FINALLY, A Note About Margin:** All accounts can have Margin (generally) but that doesn't mean you should use it.  I thought all night about writing this because if you fucks come onto one of my platforms and do a ton of stupid shit and get me banned from being able to buy/sell common stocks I'll be pissed.  But in the effort of giving us, the little guy a chance I felt it better to put this here.  ***Borrowing money to buy stocks is stupid and in the long run you will lose money either from depreciation of account value or interest OR BOTH.***  If you're holding GME on margin right now, for example, you might be best opening a new account and not doing a transfer because you don't want your new brokerage to restrict your trading because you seem high risk.  Obviously some of the bigger, better brokerages may start making their new account process harder anyway if they see an influx of what they deem to be risky investors coming over but I'd suggest you be first in line before that happens if you want to be up and trading THIS WEEK.

I have buried this part at the bottom because I wanted the message to be heard before any of my own thoughts were placed in here.  **I personally am finding it a bit on the nose that so many people are claiming that they're going to "*****hold until Valhalla!"*** **and yet they aren't willing to freeze their trading ability for a 4-5 business day process for a transfer to happen.**  That is suspect AF to me but that's just me.  

If people want recommendations of brokerages to consider new accounts with I offer some ideas:

* Vanguard
* TRowe Price
* Merrill Edge (especially if you bank with Bank of America this is going to be your best bet because money should transfer instantly)
* Fidelity
* TDAmeritrade/Charles Schwab (though I may have read they're restricting buying so check that first)

To my knowledge all of these platforms allow you to sign up for a new account instantly online, or very close to it.  If you do nothing over the weekend and nothing first thing Monday morning to correct this Robinhood situation that it seems many of you are in (and believe me, I feel we're brothers in this and therefore I'm trying to help) then I will remain baffled and I'll be sad to see you guys continue to be squeezed.  I have been able to buy dips this past week that you guys weren't and that sucks.  Good luck gents, you no longer have any reason to be dicked around by Robinhood and I suggest you get on this ASAP because this week could get worse.

&amp;#x200B;

*For whatever reason mods keep deleting my shit so I have no idea how long this will be here.  I think it's because a mod accused me of PD-ing on another sub and I called them out but I can't confirm that.*  ***If you are that mod and you read this I'm still holding that position so please consider the disservice of removing this before you do.*** *Disclosure again: I don't work for any of those brokerages mentioned above.*

Title: Short Interest Can Exceed 100% of Float [Free Education for Newcomers]
It's great to see our community grow so much, but unfortunately it seems that 99% of newcomers misunderstand how shorting works. As someone who's been here since 2014, allow me to put a few wrinkles on your smooth brain.

#1. Short Interest Can Legally &amp; Legitimately Exceed 100% of Float

Here's how that works: when a share is shorted, it is borrowed from person A and sold to person B on the market. **The same share is now "owned" by 2 people.**

Importantly, person B's "phantom" share **isn't** counted as part of the float.

The same share can be sold short multiple times, so in theory there's no limit to how high short interest can go. Obviously, it's very risky to short a company that's already above 100% short interest, but it's **NOT** illegal.

#2. Naked Shorting Is Completely Different, Easy to Spot and Is Almost Definitely Not Happening

A lot of folks here are parroting accusations of "naked shorting", which is shorting without borrowing shares first. This practice *IS* illegal, but it is also very easy to detect: the DTCC will record a "failure to deliver" from whichever broker allowed naked shorting and will ask them to locate shares asap. If they don't, heads will roll, the broker loses their license and makes the news. So far there has been no evidence at all of naked shorting, so anyone saying this is spreading fake news.

_

**TL;DR:**

Shorting creates "phantom" shares which aren't counted in the float. The same share can be shorted multiple times. Thus, short interest can exceed float.

Naked shorting is very illegal, very easy to spot and isn't currently happening.

Title: One for the UK investors, and potentially the wider audience.
Firstly; GME to the moon . In with 50% of my portfolio @ $360 and riding it out until endgame. 

Now a bit of DD for you lovely retards. Take it as you please.

GGP had a fantastic 2020 with a market cap of 1.5B. The forecast is great 2021. 

Recently a great RNS was released showcasing huge gold and copper deposits, good enough to potentially catapult the SP, but what happened - nothing. This is not just exploration now, they have the facilities and permission to mine, with the box cut starting soon. 

Speculation has taken hold. Why has the SP stagnated. Word on the grapevine is MMs are holding low for an easy takeover. If true this is manipulation at its finest. It has been given an un-risked SP 70% higher than what it is being held at, and risked SP 200% higher. Even with a takeover the SP will , but if you are able to buy and hold for a year I am in no doubt of high gains. 

This is my own research, and will always share DD if I think relevant. Only invest what you can afford to lose.

Buying more GME Monday, depending on availability. See you reprobates on the other side of this worthy cause.

Title: GME Shorts Will Try to Buy From Longs Over Weekend - Discuss
Good morning retards. 

I've broken out my robe, my pipe, and my helmet so that we can sit down and contemplate the most singular and engaging question of our time:

&gt; If you were a short what would you do if you were SUPER fucked but you knew in two days you were going to be SUPER DUPER fucked? 

That's the question that we're faced with this fine Saturday morning. But let's do a quick review of the facts to understand where the shorts are possibly at before trying to answer that one.

**Current short situation**

* According to the DD floating around here we're still at 100% short interest - at least.
* Melvin and Shitron say they're out of their positions. But are they? 
* Doesn't matter. New shorts are still short and will be forced to cover. 
* We saw liquidity dry up Friday with a bid ask gap of like thousands at one point
* Shorts launched multiple short ladder attacks
* Reports of whales coming in an buying up the shorts shares during the attacks, short can't keep that up
* If shorts can't short attack because of the whales hovering up their shares, what can they do? They have to buy eventually.
* Oh and then there's the big gamma squeeze coming from Friday. 
* All call contracts expired ITM Friday. Any naked calls must be covered. More importantly - MMs will be forced to gamma hedge existing contracts for further out expiration. They do this by buying shares.
* Retail is now buying out of spite. Which is the best kind of investing I think.
* I chew crayons. I put that together from what's here. If I did you know the shorts brokers did as well. Margin requirement increase anyone?

Much of this is a summation of DD by /u/jkn_ku so read their post if you want a REALLY good blow-by-blow of Friday with some really keen insights on order flow sniping and things I had no fucking clue about: [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/).  I know, I know, /r/investing but goddamn if that isn't some killer DD and it reads like a fucking action thriller. Respect.

tl;dr shorts current situation

&gt; They are SUPER DUPER fucked early next week because of the incoming gamma squeeze, likely increasing margin requirements, whales getting involved and of course continued retail interest.

**But what's the shorts next move?**

The shorts have had a lot of tactics to scare off retail - ladder attacks, PR blitzs, lots of bots, etc. But they have ONLY ever had one move - the move they HAVE to make eventually. And that's of course to buy back the shares they owe their brokers. They're under contact to do so - it's the law.

But that's what will cause the MOASS and force them to buy from retail, right? That's what we want?

Yes! But there are other longs out there other than retail - institutional longs. These are usually big companies or funds who purchase gme for long term strategies. We haven't talked that much about them.

Here's a list and the amount of shares they own from an Investors.com [article](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/gme-stock-gamestop-investors-instantly-make-16-billion-gamestop-stock-squeeze/).

Holder |Common Shares Held (Millions) |% Of CSO |Gain ($ Billions) |Position Date Update
---|---|----|----|----|----
FMR (Fidelity Investments) |9.5 |13.7% |$3.0 |Sep-30-2020
Ryan Cohen |9.0 |12.9 |2.9 |Jan-10-2021
BlackRock |8.6 |12.3 |2.7 |Sep-30-2020

Donald A. Foss |3.5 |5.0 |1.1 |Feb-28-2020
MUST Asset Management |3.3 |4.7 |1.1 |Mar-18-2020

I want to be clear. Longs only represent 51.m shares. And many of these are funds that probably cannot sell due to their fund balancing requirements and what not (I don't know - just guessing there). 

Shorts are shorts AT LEAST 100% according to all of the DD we've read. They still have to buy ALL of retails shares. There is no way that I can see for them to avoid doing so. But they WILL try to lessen the pain. 

And these institutional longs are seeing BILLIONS in gains (with a B) so who knows what could happen.

So I am speculating that the shorts will approach institutional longs over the weekend for some sort of deal. So keep your eyes and ears open and helmets strapped on tight!

Fellow degenerates, I know this past week has been trying on us all, however you have held strong despite all attempts at being gamed by Melvin et al. attacks on our diamond hands. I saw this article on another sub and it is by far the most intelligent thorough DD on what has happened and what will be.

Title: Dr. StrangeDip (or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love The Bomb)
###Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. If you follow this advice, youll probably lose your money. [Im not smart](http://wiki.chssigma.com/images/a/a0/Little_tikes_car_why.jpg). Im straight up lying and misinformed. This is satire. Dont do this. Pay your obligations. Dont bet what you cant afford to lose, etc. etc. 

Thesis:  r not fuk and then  are ultra fuk. 

Hold on to your buttsacks. I think you noobs entered the market at the wrong fucking time.  

I have a secret weapon. Its called GEX. Im not going to explain how it works. You dont have the attention span anyway. Except its not a secret. Everyone with half a fucking clue knows about GEX. Go ahead and backtest it. Combine it with a few other signals. Its my doomsday machine. 

Brakes are cut, bitches. Rouge soldiers are in the air right now on their way to drop that liquidity bomb that we all thought was actually going to come from the Fed saying interest rates too low imo somewhere near 2025. 

Well, that liquidity bomb damn near happened a couple times this week. Theres some pretty good DD floating around about that but Ill let you go hunt for it.

If there are any bears even left, theyre spending their weekend rage splooging all over the Lambo catalogue because they know how close they came to being able to afford food again. 

Theyre not done, imo. The market is saying were pricing options in a way that expects a tremendous, earth-shattering move. But like I said, everyone with half a clue already knows about GEX and sees this too *and is getting ready for it*. 

Boom. Major bear market. 

End of days all r fuk?

Yes. And then no.

Imo, this bomb is occurring in a market environment that has never been more ready to take it to the face and punch back. Money is cheap af right now. Theres liquidity upstream. Three Gorges Dam liquidity thats ready to buy.the.fucking.dip. But I dont think theyre going to be able to smash the damn down quite fast enough. Its entirely possible that they do; in that case, my thesis r fuk.

But if I am right, I think I might actually get a chance to do a March2020 do-over. 

And this time, Im not even going to worry about winning on the way down. Im buying the fucking dip.

A CALL is like CALLing bullshit. no way Ford is going up. Buy a CALL options.

Title: DO NOT SELL UNLESS YOU NEED TO
We are in full lockdown mode atm, with not selling, and yes we need to keep holding to make these hedge funds bleed, however;

THIS BATTLE IS GOING TO LAST WEEKS SO DONT LET YOUR INTREST RATES FUCK YOU OVER

However ive been here since the very beginning and a lot of people took out bank loans and max'ed out their credit cards to buy GME.

I am one of these people, I sold on the thursday after the drop, however after being ashamed of becoming a paper handed fuck, I brought back in for the same amount of shares friday morning with my overdraft.

The money I made after selling on thursday is in transit to my bank as we speak, however im getting charged intrest on that overdraft everyday. So once that money has turned up in my bank, i will be selling a bit of gme to cover that intrest.

This is an all out war, however make sure you guys stay healthy.

Hedge funds are going to prolong this as long as possible hoping that the trend dies down, however we will stay strong.

I wouldnt be surprised if this ends at the end of Feb or even longer.

KEEP HOLDING GUYS WE WILL WIN THIS!

Title: $GME Autistic Epiphany
I combined two posts on WSB in my head and something big hit me.

This [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8bwtx/why_gme_fundamentals_dont_matter_for_gme_stock/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) explains how you're not just buying $GME when you buy their stock. You're also buying a stake in all the hedgies shorting it. 

Then this [second post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8hxs6/burning_questions_on_gme_no_one_in_sec_will_answer/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) explains how it's not just the hedgies shorting $GME. There's a big bank backing the hedgies; like a too-big-to-fail big bank.

So all these CNBC boomers taking about $GME fUnDaMeNtAlS are just fucking with us. Here's what's probably the truth (THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. I'M NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR. AM RETARDED): 

Since more shares of $GME are sold short than actually exist (~110-120%), we're getting a 10-20% discount on a too-big-to-fail institution AND GameStop's business. This applies at any share price as long as the shorted shares exceed existing shares. If this is true, the squeeze is successful, and we sell when the squeeze occurs, our investment is backed by the US Government.

Title: Short squeeze exodus
Looking for someone smarter than myself to see if there's a way this can work. 

Anyone remember watching Papa Elon's inclusion into the s&amp;p?

 The requests never moved from the set ranges on. It was consistent on every bid. If short sellers must cover their shorts during the squeeze if it's orchestrated that everyone sell at a certain price range(by limit order), just for shits let's say $1000-2000$ asks (I don't know what price the stock will be at during the squeeze this is just a hypothetical range make it 10k if you like). Would shorts be forced to cover as long as no one sold beneath the range?


The only reasons I'm asking are

1) because I don't know enough about shorts to know if this could work. Seeing if anyone has any ideas

2) i feel like if social media &amp; autists helped push this rally thus far they can help everyone orchestrate an exodus together. 

3) APES!!! TOGETHER!!! STRONG!!! RIGHT?!?!

Note: This is not financial advice I'm just your average dumbdumb. I have no positions in gme just want to see you all paid, I will buy shares for you autists Monday and post for proof. 

If this will work someone confirm and spread the word to everyone you can. The world is lurking wsb right now shit spreads like wildfire.



Title: This is how i know GME is going to reach $1000+ very soon
Remember Thursday? We suffered massive short attack and price plummeted to $115 and closed at 189$. Shorters tied our hands behind our backs. Brokers such as Robinhood, WeBull and other banned us from buying GME. Media was saying the squeeze is finished, Cramer was telling us to sell and get out while we can. The next day, on Friday, we were touching $500. Whatever happens do not sell. You will only help the shorts who are using illegal tactics to stop the bleeding. Next week, we will get to new heights. $1000+ is not a meme, it is a very real scenario. 

GME short interest remains at arond 113.31% as reported by most reliable sources. The short squeeze has not even started.  Shorters have doubled down and loaded up again. **We have all the time in the world because we own shares, shorters do do not have this luxury. They are bleeding billions as we speak.** Stay put, stay strong, hold your shares and do not sell before we are around $1000 - 5000. This simple strategy will make us all winners  

Title: Need to know information for anyone new or anyone considering changing brokers
Credit to u/Dessiato

YOU FUCKIN WRONG CAUSE WE GOT SOME HOMIES ON DECK ROBINHOODS JUST A SMALL INDIE COMPANY COMPARED TO THEM

A PREFACE: DO NOT XFER OUT OF RH. THIS ADVICE IS FOR NEW BUYERS ONLY OR FOR THOSE WHO HOLD MORE THAN 5 SHARES IN RH AND WANT TO BUY MORE. ANYONE BOUGHT ON RH, DISABLE STOP LIMIT. DISABLE MARGIN, AND HOLD ON CASH.

Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further WE GOT TOO FUCKING BIG!. GOOD! due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

Fidelity and Vanguard. You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. They will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

Take this opportunity by the balls and never let go.

Title: THE HEDGIES ARE DOUBLING DOWN ON THE BET THAT RETAIL (YOU) IS TOO STUPID TO MAINTAIN AN ATTENTION SPAN BEYOND ONE WEEK: A FULL BATTLEGROUND ANALYSIS
Timeline:

- u/Deepfuckingvalue, Burry, and a few others realize the opportunity of a lifetime. Hedge funds scoff at it.

- The DD is sound and the GME buying gains traction, hedgies continue to dismiss the inferior masses

- GME sees a *subtle* (relative term) increase. Brokers begin politely asking to borrow your shares. The tip of the iceburg. Retail doesnt bite.

- This week, first colossal moon. Boomer after boomer gets on TV talking about the imminent demise of retail. After all havent the hedgies always been here to protect us?

- second consecutive space mission. Now it has gained national media attention. Hedgies are undoubtedly in *deep shit*. They coordinate a multi pronged attack against the idiots (people like us):

- cut off volume by limiting buying on one side of the trade

- push the narrative that short positions are closed (Even shooting literal fake news commercials).

- get on tv and sell fear, tell people its for their protection, because of course they care about our best interest, even being in direct contrast with their own.

- coordinate ladder attacks with low volume to artificially push down price, thereby hopefully triggering some stop loss and paper hand sells

- slander the forum of communication that many a retail reader prefer to use, even as far as accusing this particular sub of white supremacy (LOL WUT).

- hire online shills to push alternative stocks or generally disparage GME as a prospective value play

- Take billion dollar loans from their buddies with the assurance that these retail idiots cant hold their attention span, and the price will decrease and they can exit all poisons safely and pay out.

- THIS IS THE TRULY FUCKED UP PART: in their infinite fucking Hubris, they doubled down on shorts  and still expect to come up  billions positive on the position.

TLDR: they asked nice then broke every rule in the book to buy more time, while doubling down.

WHY WOULD THEY BREAK THE LAW???!

Along with never being told no their whole lives, theres actually a logical reason why they took the illegal manipulation route to save over $6 billion in losses this week.

This overshorting will kill their funds. Plain and simple. What happens when you corner a wild animal? It attacks. Thats what happened this week. Also, litigation is time consuming, so they have that as well.

WHATS THIS MEAN FOR US?

the good news is that many people have a positive outlook on GME. Price held despite many coordinated attacks. Hedgies bought time but theyre still cornered. 

THE ONLY WAY OUT IS IF YOU FUCKING SELL.

If you thought Friday was the big day, boy do I have a treat for you. This is just chapter 1 of a god damned Tolkien novel. Best believe that the suits will continue to thrash about as their positions continue to hemorrhage. 

IS THE SQUEEZE SQUOZE?

trust me youll fucking know when the squeeze is squozen. 

Bottom line: I LIKE THE STOCK

Title: Consider SPY puts
With memestocks mooning its a possibility that hedge funds start liquidate their long positions to cover their clown ass short bets on the market. I myself believe this is already happening which is why we saw the SPY &amp; other major indices go down during the week once all this got more and more attention.
Im expecting a huge fucking red day on monday on everything except memestocks.

This is not financial advice.
Positions:  SPY FDs.

Good luck to you all next week!

Title: $AMC DD (2/1/21-X/X/X)
DISCLAIMER: 
I am not a financial advisor. This is a DD (Due Diligence) post in regard to the upcoming squeeze aimed at AMC. The information is a collection of research from credible sources with some of my personal thoughts on the topic.

NOTE: ANYONE WHO IS INFORMED ON THE MARKET AND HOW IT WORKS, SKIP TO PART 2.

This DD will cover more than average DD's since WSB has gained a large following of new traders who can benefit from a full description.

Part 1: $AMC, what is it? 
---[Source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_Theatres)---
AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. is an American movie theater chain headquartered in Leawood, Kansas, and the largest movie theater chain in the world. Founded in 1920, AMC has the largest share of the U.S. theater market ahead of Regal and Cinemark Theatres.

Part 1.2: What is a squeeze?
A squeeze in the market ($GME, $AMC) is a phenomenon that occurs when shorts have to be covered, especially by high class traders (hedge fund managers). 

Part 1.3:What are shorts, why are they popular with the top 1%?
In short selling, a position is opened by borrowing shares of a stock that the investor believes will decrease in value by a set future date (the expiration date of the short). The investor then sells these borrowed shares to buyers willing to pay market price. Before the borrowed shares must be returned, the trader is betting on the prices decline and then can purchase them at a lower cost. This stategy is HIGH RISK HIGH REWARD.

Part 1.4 (final intro peice): Why do squeezes cause losses up top?
Simple. In the case of $GME the hedge funds bet that $GME would fall. Logically, they should have been right. But as I'm sure everyone knows, WSB and working class investors from all over the world flipped the trend on its head. So, since the hedge funds bet on a fall they had to cover the losses caused by their BORROWED positions becoming absolutely useless (nice). 

Part 2: The stats on $AMC. 
---Paraphrased from "Yahoo Finance", Some IMO.---
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted and 14% are being longed. Now what everyone is waiting for it when shorted shares expire and the hedge funds have to cover what they bet and lost on. Keep in mind not every share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. Today's target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 and we closed at $13.29! This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Feb 1/21) So Monday when they're forced to cover the $8.63 they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher from said stimulus. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96.  Over the next few trading days it is going to be a strong squeeze. $AMC is standing where $GME did a week ago. Hold your ground. Gains coming in hot next week. 

Part 3: What are our targets for buying and selling?
THIS REQUIRES DIAMOND HANDS 
From what I have read, buying into $AMC at $17 or below is a safe bet. My exit plan is to secure some profit next week as the squeeze reaches it's height, and reinvest (into $AMC)  a comfortable amount based on collected gain. I plan to keep shares for up to 12-18 months so long as $AMC keeps on the track we can see now.
AGAIN, I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR. MY WORD IS NOT LAW.

Part 4: Beware The Big Man (Reason for Holding)
Big money managers and short sellers are going to manipulate the stock in the after hours session to scare us investors out of buying and holding with the intent of executing their shorts as planned or to cushion the blow from failed investment. Again, .

Part 5: The Conclusion on $AMC in short (wording wise) 
The statistics on this stock are legit. 
The company is longstanding (70+ years)
The company is legit
A squeeze is seemingly inevitable
Being the largest theatre company, post COVID gains are likely as cinemas will re-open.
The hedge funds are in a position to be bent over again via their shorts in $AMC.
Last but not least, I know alot of you autists lost alot of money gambling during highs on $KTOV, $XSPA, $GNUS, and many others... So why not get some tendies for once.

--------------------------------

AGAIN I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR, THIS IS A COLLECTION OF DATA AND RESEARCH BASED ON RECENT TRENDS AND $AMC's POSITION IN THE MARKET AS OF CLOSE ON (1/29/21)
I AM NOT LIABLE FOR LOSSES OR THE REASON FOR GAIN.
THIS POST IS STRICTLY FOR SHARING INFORMATION GATHERED.

Title: DD on the future of the market and why I am switching to a gay bear 
#Preface
Holding $250k GME [proof]( https://imgur.com/ylnsvES). I was a permabull until I hit the submit button on this post

Now that I got your limited autistic attention with the troll-baiting title. Now that Ive won you over to my side with my retarded fucking yolo position on GME, I am going to share with you my prediction on stock market as a whole for the next six months. 

#TLDR
Hold GME until Citadel is dead. Puts on anything a few months after that. Wall street will win in the end but Ill come out on top.

#Where we are today
Its not hard to argue that we are in a large bubble of epic proportions. We had COVIND shut down the world economy and less than 1 year later the SPY is trading up 65% from the bottom. Meanwhile we have tech stocks like TSLA up over 500%. I dont think this is sustainable and we are overdue for a bear market. 

Okay, so what will happen?
Good question!

#What will happen
##Short Term (1-4 weeks)
This GME short squeeze is going to trigger, and it will trigger soon. Once the short sellers get margin called the price of GME is going to rocket up to incomprehensible levels. (Im holding till $69,420) Some hedge funds will die out, maybe we kill off a broker. Who knows, maybe a too bank if were lucky. The retail investors will get a win and the overall stock market will be okay.  At $10,000/share the market cap is only $700 billion. This is a lot to us, but not enough to actually impact wall street.
Maybe GME is just the start and wsb starts buying up other over shorted meme stocks. I dont know, but i wouldn't bet that wall street will let us get more than one win in-a-row.  

Once the GME squeeze is squoze we move on to the mid term.

##Mid Term (1-3 months)
In the case of GME retail won and hedge funds lost. Wall Street doesnt like losing and now they know that we can hold them by the balls and start a short squeeze on other stocks with infinite risk involved to the hedge funds.  
For example, If the short float ratio for a stock is 70% and wsb goes in and buys up 40% of the shares holding them in diamond hands, guess what happens. We artificially limit the float causing a short ratio of more than 100%. 
The hedge funds will see this coming and start to off load their shorts before they get stuck in another short squeeze. 

While this is happening the hedge funds will be buying back stocks at an increasing price. Since retail won with GME, and now that they have all this new money with a risk tolerance of a mentally disabled gorilla, they will start buying up all these stocks little the dumb kids they are. Its going to look like retail is about to start another new type of bubble that will last forever. A bubble built on the speculation that meme stocks will short squeeze again and again. A **squebble** if you will. Really what is happening is that the hedge funds are exiting their short positions and taking the loss before another squeeze starts. We will know this is happening if the over shorted meme-stocks start raising in price while the short shares start declining. This brings us to the third and final term. 

##Long term (4 - 8 months)
Okay quick recap: 
Were in a bubble
hedge funds are closing shorts
retail is buying up everything. 

This is going to be the end of short selling to this extreme. Not because of regulations, or fines, or prison time, but because we now have the power to abuse the system against them. Hedge funds or brokers wont allow this type of overeverage from happening again. Since short selling is a very profitable tactic that is now off the table, the value added in from the margin trades will diminish and the stock market is going to decrease in value. Hedge funds will see the writing on the wall and start to move into safe investments. Maybe they go into cash, maybe into gold, I dont know. Im just a 25 year old engineer who doesnt really know shit about the stock market or where money flows to in a bear market. 

#End game
Still here? Great! Follow me to the epic conclusion of this 2 page novel. 
Hedge funds are moving money into safe investments before the impending bear market. Retail, however, is still high on life like a fucking dipwad huffing paint buying up everyhting under the sun. Pretty soon the hedges and retail will stop buying because of exhaustion (It literally cant go up forever, sorry bulls )  We all saw what happens when there is no one to buy a stock thanks to Robinhood removing the buy button. In this case it will be because no one will buy since everything is way too overvalued. **This is when everything comes tumbling down.** It will start with the risky meme and tech stocks since those are what wallstreet will exit from first. Then it will cascade into everything else. 

We are about to witness a bubble pop larger than anything ever before. This time the game has been changed against wall street and only an epic bear market will remove retail from the big kids table once again. 

#Positions
1. Short term: 100% GME baby! [proof]( https://imgur.com/ylnsvES) 
2. Mid term: Cash I guess? I'll probably lose everything here 
3. Long term: 9/16 TSLA  $400p

Title: Shorts are out of liquidity -- DD Inside
[https://imgur.com/a/oZkVNlw](https://imgur.com/a/oZkVNlw)

This really says it all. 

Yesterday there were 100M in 1 DTE SPY puts purchased yesterday, sold this morning. This morning there were tens of millions more in 0DTE SPY puts purchased. 

If anyone can verify this with tier 2 data, I would bet that these 150k/100k/75k Put options were purchased in huge blocks throughout yesterday and today. 

We've all known that they are going to bleed their positions to keep GME afloat, but this is worse. They're bleeding the SPY. 401k's, retirement funds, the works.

These trades represent capital generation of somewhere probably in the area of 500 million dollars, which is enough to get them through a couple days of kicking the GME can. 

Someone smarter than me needs to work out what we do with this information.

Title: GME and VW are not the same. Please stop comparing them.
So many people are throwing around graphs overlaying the two companies. They look the same when you condense time and dismiss volume. People even think the dips to the left of the squeeze are similar, except almost NO SHARES were moving in VW before the squeeze.

*Processing img ebgtj9wttee61...*

I am not saying WHAT $GME is. I am simply saying what it ISN'T. I have read time and time again on this sub over the last week or so that VW happened over days, and everyone that wanted out could get out. VW short squoze because Porsche simply ate up a ton of stock in short order and the shorts got obliterated. THAT IS NOT WHAT IS HAPPENING with $GME.

Please, just look at the volume. The VW volume is in the THOUSANDS with the peak squeeze day over 20,000. $GME was OVER FIFTY MILLION just today and it was the lowest volume of the week.

I don't know what $GME is. I want to think it is everyone beating up on Wall Street for tendies. But I do know that it is for sure, not even in the same universe as what happened to VW.

So many people here are new to trading and I love the positivity, but these millions of new people don't know anything. I am not saying to sell. Fuck it, hold **FOREVER**. But do not think for a moment that you are guaranteed a supernova like VW. It was, after all, a supernova that benefitted practically no one. Porsche simply tried to gobble up the company and the stock immediately returned the baseline because Porsche didn't care about propping the share price, they just wanted the controlling interest. The VW chart is a fluke.

No one knows what $GME is, certainly not me, and least of all anyone comparing it to the VW, two-day squeeze.

Slightly Unrelated Note: If you want to know how that takeover went for Porsche, just ask yourself who owns whom now. Hint: it isn't called the Porsche Group.

**Positions:** *None*. I have **zero** liquidity right now, but next week I should have some, and I will be buying $GME shares at **any** price.

The growth rate of users on dating apps worldwide has been steadily increasing:

[https://www.businessofapps.com/data/dating-app-market/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/dating-app-market/) 

Of these, Tinder is the most popular by a significant amount; hence, I will use that as my example to illustrate some points going forward:

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/826778/most-popular-dating-apps-by-audience-size-usa/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/826778/most-popular-dating-apps-by-audience-size-usa/)

[https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tinder-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tinder-statistics/)

Facebook growth rate:

[https://www.statista.com/chart/10047/facebooks-monthly-active-users/](https://www.statista.com/chart/10047/facebooks-monthly-active-users/)

The tinder to Facebook comparison is not intended to illustrate that tinder could ever get into the same level of popularity of Facebook; it is much more niche. Rather, the comparison is to illustrate that the growth rates have similarities proportionally.  

Key factor in business model:

Tinder has two primary sources of income. One of which derives from monetization, which has proven to be extremely fruitful for all social media apps thus far.  

Most importantly, they have a subscription based product, Tinder gold for only $15. This has proven to be extremely successful as 6 million of their total 57 million users use it. Thats 10% of their total users, that specifically chose for the paid model. To put how vast this percentage is into perspective, YouTube has about 2 billion active users, while only 1.5 million are subscribed to YouTube red for $5.  

What makes tinder gold differ from other traditional free app optional subscriptions:

Unlike many subscriptions, tinder gold does not simply remove the ads from the UI. People are paying for two things primarily; they are first paying for the potential to have their profile be seen by others more, since it is extremely competitive. More importantly, they are also able to see the profiles of people who like them. This is a huge factor, because without it, tinder does not allow you to see who likes you. It forces you to continue swiping on random people until you stumble across someone who liked you. Due to basic human nature, people want to immediately see what people liked them, they want to cut to the chase. Therefore, they are required to sign up for tinder gold in order to see them.

Another huge money maker for tinder is the profile boosters. You can pay a certain fee, in exchange for tinders algorithm to push your own profile into more peoples feeds for a finite period of time. This results in significantly more likes and matches. These are not points or games, these are real people, so many often get a rush from this and continue to use more and more boosts after they see how affective it is.  

These being only three sources of their income alone already should illustrate how advanced Tinder is in terms of marketing their products. Tinder preys on basic human nature, and it has resulted in incredible user and financial growth.

Many of these other dating apps that are owned by Match include very similar marketing tactics. Again, I used tinder as an example simply because it is the most popular, and allows me to simplify some of my points regarding these dating apps. It is also the most profitable, due to the impressive marketing tactics I explained

The company revealed Tinder pulled in $1.2 billion in revenue over 2019, a 43% increase from 2018. Match owns several other high-profile dating platforms including Hinge and OkCupid, but overall revenue for the year was $2.1 billion meaning it gets more than half its revenue from Tinder.

Total balance sheet:

Anecdotal notes:

Perhaps some investors will shun me for even considering anecdotal experience to be note worthy, but I do feel that if some individuals have experienced something, it is more than likely to have occurred outside of that individual experience as well:

A large problem with dating apps is that there is a stigma to meeting someone online, or even having the apps downloaded. Several years ago, I remember seeing jokes about people who needed to use tinder to find girlfriends. I even remember seeing memes about people trying to hide the tinder app three layers deep into a hidden folder on their phones. This stigma certainly still exists, but from my experience, it has certainly decreased. Its no longer about needing to use the app, its becoming more normalized. The popularity charts I provided illustrate this as well. Many people dont even use tinder to meet people; many simply use it to entertain themselves or meet people virtually.

The stigma is dying, and as it continues to die, there will be continuous increases in users. The largest stigma was actually buying the subscription for Tinder gold, which gives you a select amount of features. However, even this is becoming more normalized. People can justify it by simply wanting to see who likes them, rather than being for the benefit of helping your own profile be seen. Curiosity didnt kill the cat in this case, but it influenced over 6 million users to spend at least $15 a month. 

Entry point?

I figured now would be a good time to make this post since they are coming off a recent sell off. The support has not proven itself yet, so it certainly has more temporary downside potential. Regardless, if youre in it for the long run, this wont matter as much. Watch for potential support Monday, 

This post will probably be brushed aside due to the short squeeze focus point at the moment, but feel free to share your thoughts if you do end up reading this. Im very open minded and completely accept that I can very well be completely wrong on this. I mostly would like to hear peoples thoughts regarding the key factors of the business model I mentioned. I really do feel that they are next level in terms of preying on human psychology. Its extremely impressive marketing in my opinion from a scientific perspective at least.

Title: $GME DD: Why Fidelity and Vanguard did not block buying while everyone else did. 
Have you ever wondered why Fidelity and Vanguard are the only two brokers who haven't restricted Gamestop trading? 

Fidelity owns 14% of Gamestop. 

Vanguard owns 7.6% of GameStop.

Neither of them need to answer to Citadel either. Simple as that.

This also lends support to the theory that for some reason other brokers need to manipulate trading for their own interests.

Title: READ THIS if you expected a huge gamma squeeze today after close above $320
 OG poster u/PlayFree_Bird

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, I hate to say it, but there is some less-than-ideal information circulating out there, particularly about the famed "gamma squeeze" we hear so much about these days. I'll get to that. Let's go through the questions you simpletons want to know, as explained by a mouth-breathing fool who has managed to convince you he knows what he's talking about:

# Did we win today? Is it endgame?

Kind of. Be patient.

# In what ways did we win?

First, there was the obvious victory of bouncing back 65% today after the worst market manipulation I've ever witnessed. We kept the upward momentum going.

Secondly, every day you finish higher is another day the shorts are underwater. If you are perpetually going up, the walls are closing in on them.

Finally, a lot of put options expired worthless today while a number of call options expired in-the-money. It's always good to make put holders lose money because you drain the bank accounts of people betting against you.

# Yes! Call options! We finished above $320 and get a gamma squeeze to infinity now, right?

No. That's not how this works. Too many people don't quite understand what a gamma squeeze is.

A gamma squeeze happens when call option sellers (or "writers") have to hedge their naked calls by buying stocks. They do this because the risk of selling naked calls is theoretically infinite if they don't. It's called delta hedging. You don't need to know all the fancy math ("delta" and "gamma" are those greek symbols for nerds), just understand this: as it becomes more probable that the call option you sold will cost you money, you hedge more.

This is a continuous PROCESS, not a discreet moment in time. The market makers and hedge funds and institutions selling you calls don't wake up on Friday morning and think, "Shit! I think I'm going to lose everything if these stocks keep going up! I have to BUY NOW!!!" That would be stupid. They are hedging all the way up. I guarantee you that most of the calls that were exercised at $320 today were already covered. They already went out and bought those shares and most of the upwards pressure that places on the market is priced in already.

# So, no gamma squeeze?

Probably not significantly. They're not going to be madly rushing out on Monday to buy shit they already own for the most part.

# Why are people talking about a gamma squeeze at $320, then?

We did have a gamma squeeze at $320. On Wednesday, two days ago. The price exceeded $320 (then the highest strike price on the books) and promptly surged to $371 before coming back down to around $320. That's what a gamma squeeze is: a frenzied rush by call sellers to cover calls.

It typically happens BEFORE expiration, not after. It's rare for market makers to get so caught with their pants down that they have to get squeezed for the previous week's calls on a Monday. I don't know where this idea of a gamma squeeze now at $320 is coming from.

# This hurts my feelings. So, what's so great about the $320 threshold, anyway? Did it matter at all?

It's still a good thing. There may have been a few lingering naked calls to cover. And, like I said, it's always good to make put-holders lose money because stick it to the , that's why.

$320 was a significant level because there were quite a few open call options at that strike. You can see the entire option chain here: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain)

Go through and count up all the January 29th options that were in-the-money at today's close. I think maybe 90,000 or something? Screw it, I didn't count. Somebody who can figure out how to use a calculator can add those up. Multiply that number by 100 (because option contracts are sold in groups of 100) and that's how many shares need to change hands thanks to contracts expiring ITM.

It may be that with so many shares needing to change hands and so little liquidity in this market, some weird things could happen.

# What weird things?

Well, if nothing else, a lot of shares will need to be tied up as the process of settling calls plays out.

You have to remember that when somebody says they own shares, they don't necessarily *own* own the shares right at that moment.

When you press "buy" on your phone and it says your order was filled, that doesn't mean that the process happens instantaneously. For all intents and purposes as far as you are concerned, sure, the process looks instant. However, there's a lot of messy stuff that happens on the back-end of the system between the brokers and the clearing houses. The clearing houses are where the daily tab gets settled: who owes whom and what they owe and at what price, etc.

Monday could be interesting as this tab for millions of stocks (in a market with only 50-something million shares actively circulating) gets settled. It might not be crazy, but it could. We'll see.

Michael Burry (Christian Bale, for all you noobs) seems to think that all the naked short-selling above the float will result in a shit-storm when people actually go to get their shares back: [https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/status/1355221824661983233](https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/status/1355221824661983233)

Liquidity crunch + lots of shares being moved around + nobody knows where they all are currently = potential nightmare for Wall Street.

# I just want my infinite short squeeze and my tendies, so how do we get the MOASS?

Something needs to be the catalyst. Something needs to get the short sellers really underwater, so much so that they are drowning. That's why there's been so much hype about gamma squeezes; the gamma and short squeezes are two separate things, but the gamma squeezing has been really good to us lately. It has triggered some crazy upwards price movements. I still think one was about to happen yesterday morning that would have triggered the squeeze-pocalypse, the Mother of All Short Squeezes. The bastards at the brokerages (acting with and for the clearing houses), took your tendies. It's criminal what played out.

I actually think a gamma squeeze was possible today, as well, as the price shot up to $378 around noon. If it had gotten to $400, it stood a very good chance of running up to $500, which would have caused a run up to $650 and beyond. Then Robinhood said, "Oh, actually, you plebs cannot buy 5 shares anymore, only 2 now." The price came back down again.

Oddly enough, the S&amp;P500 sold off over a full percentage point (that's a lot of money) right after GME hit that $378 peak. Do you think this doesn't freak the finance world out? They know a gamma squeeze is like the fuse on a firework. It consumes itself until it ignites the rocket.

# How will Wall Street defend themselves?

They will try to keep snipping the fuse. That's what all these restrictions on brokerages are about. They are trying to defuse the situation slowly because having it all get sorted out quickly and frantically is no good for them.

We need enough upwards price momentum that those option chains keep going up and up and feeding on themselves. They need to become a self-sustaining chain reaction, fed by hedging pressure. And you need to put pressure on your elected representatives to tell them that Wall Street cannot be allowed to just shut down the game when they are losing. I hate to tell you this, but the squeeze has so far been stopped purely by the losers declaring that it will not happen at any cost. It's bullshit. Eat the rich. But there it is.

# Do you feel you've used the word "squeeze" too much by now?

Yes. I've been writing and looking at the word "squeeze" so much that it is starting to lose its meaning. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeeeeeze.

Title: The stranglehold of GME longs vs shorts
This is additional data to u/imnotatreeyet:

Pls correct me if im tardly wrong.

Thanks so much for this let me add my retard maths:
If it cost $14.63 mil in daily interest to sustain shorts at $313 a share

Then the $2.75 billion by Citadel can cover interest (assuming it covers for all shorts) for 187.96 days - rounded 187 days.

Of course since bitch Melvin gets 2.75bil  his total coverage assume as 15% of total short so his interest is 15% of $14.63 mil = $2.19 mil

So with $2.75 bil, Melvin can ride out interest in 1,255 days assuming stock stays $313.

However no investor wants his money to bleed  like that time of month, so i assume 1/3 will be used for Melvin to hold at $313 so that is 418 days

We do not know capital infusion other shorts have. So worst case assume they can hold for around 2/3 of a year at $313 (2/3 cost not every short has baby daddy citadel to balls deep $2.75bil)

What next? Buy to raise price and hold to maintain pressure on shorts interest and lock their capital. That will likely make them give up and cover, resulting in price .

But if large amount is sold, opposite will happen, due to large short interest the stock price will fall and fall and meet the shorts expectations.

Summary this is a stranglehold between long and righteous holders like us and short mofos. Only one will get out alive.

I hold 3 shares and love this stock.

Disclaimer: this not financial advice.

TLDR: Buy and hold or   will destroy the stock price and company. Means no more games PS5 and Xbox u tards!!!!   

Title: Actual direct DD: The real reason why GME is not crippled on Fidelity and Vanguard.
&gt;Fidelity FMR is the top holder of GameStop shares. It owns 9.5 million shares, through September, or nearly 14% of shares outstanding. Adding that up and Fidelity hauled in a $3 billion gain just this year for its investors.  
&gt;  
&gt;Similarly, BlackRock scored $2.7 billion and Vanguard $1.7 billion, as they own 12.3% and 7.6% of GameStop, respectively.

[https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/gme-stock-gamestop-investors-instantly-make-16-billion-gamestop-stock-squeeze/](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/gme-stock-gamestop-investors-instantly-make-16-billion-gamestop-stock-squeeze/)

Title: For all those holding call options that are ITM but didnt expire today, could we not add additional buying pressure on Monday??
So we closed above $325 today! That was a HUGE victory!! More than 9 million shares have to be given/bought on Monday because of the number of calls that expired ITM today. All I have to say is, great job guys on holding the line!

Now hear me out. Lots of us are holding call options DEEP in the money right now. I personally have Feb 19th options. What if everyone who has options ITM this Monday exercised them during the already frenzied buying spree for the calls that expired today? We could potentially add MILLIONS more in buying pressure that the shorts dont even expect to have on Monday.

This could potentially cause the most insane gamma squeeze following into immediate short squeeze if we all did this. ESPECIALLY since we all suspect there are almost no more shares left available to buy. We could literally FORCE the squeeze to happen Monday if enough people do this.

Personally, I have 30 deep ITM calls and I plan to sell as few as possible Monday to be able to have the funds to exercise the rest.

TLDR: Exercise all ITM calls Monday so GME will 

Im just a retard not a financial advisor. My advice might be dumb.

Title: A DD to lose money with

Heres a couple solid DD. Do your own research, I just like these stonks. 

GE 

GE has started to break into other fields. The "new" GE focuses on aviation, power, heath care and renewable energy. Their aviation sector has been impacted with COVID and the grounding of 737s, but the recent uplift should help this. Their financial outlook looks brighter and they are slashing debt with new leadership. 

Positions - 100 shares, calls- 15$ 1/15/22 x10 (i know Im poor) 

Other stocks - AQMS- might be a good DD for the new administration.

Title: The Case For Rolls-Royce ($RYCEY) Part 1
 BUY GME then BUY RYCEY

First one was deleted so here goes nothing.

Whats up everyone, I want to share a stock with you that I think has the possibility to moon VERY soon: Rolls-Royce ($RYCEY). This will be longish, oh well. Im bored. And drunk. Once the GME millions are made by everyone, consider RR.

This isnt the RR company that makes those fancy cars, this a major league British Aerospace Company who is responsible for making a lot of engines for airplanes, land-based generation, and sea-faring ships. Im an engineer who works on gas turbines. Everyday. I know this field, and Rolls Royce is a HUGE player. Seeing the stock at $1.40 shocked EVERYONE I work with. I even had to show one of them how to buy a stock JUST so he could buy $RYCEY.
I believe they have the possibility to more than triple in the next year. Since you simpletons like bullets, here they are:

1.     It recently closed at less than $1.40/share. This is INSANE. It makes the companys value only $11.2 billion while they have an enterprise value of $17.4 billion!! For those Graham/Buffet investors, this is a WIN!

2.     Yes they are burning through cash as their gas turbine engines sit on the sidelines and orders are reduced BUT, they still have a HUGE foothold in the Aerospace door. Not only that, but their financials are actually pretty good. They recently reported $9 billion in liquidity which is an ample amount of cash to get them through 2022 (when air travel will likely pick back up)

3.     The huge amount of engines already in service makes them yachtfuls of cash. They actually make a lot of money on high-margin service on these engines.

4.     Management recently decreased the expected flight hours for 2021 (From 70% of 2019 to 50% of 2019). While yes this is technically bad for RR, I believe it to have already been priced in since the stock slid from a high of $9.30 to $1.40. Meaning the constant downward pressure on RR is a serious overreaction.

5.     They have an EXLUSIVE contract to supply engines to the airbus A350. Betting against air travel in the long term is ridiculously stupid, even for us.

6.     Buy GME

7.     Management is decreasing their personnel and restructuring their business in an. Interesting way. They signed a contract with the UK Space Agency to research nuclear power in space. They are LITERALLY going to the moon. The new management is trying to expand into high-margin areas like space tech. Their restructuring plan is scheduled to return $750 million of positive free cashflow by the end of 2021. This is HUGE. A company that is undervalued by $8 billion and likely to have positive cash flows in the next 12 months.

I can seriously keep going and plan on writing more as I have the time to. For now I have 1000 shares of RYCEY @ $1.39. Do with this information as you wish. This is not financial advice. I am not a financial adviser. Find your own damn stocks. Say it with me: "I LIKEY the RYCEY".
10 Shares GME @ $350 Buy GME, not financial advice.
EDIT 1: Added rockets for you window lickers.
EDIT 2: Buy GME

Title: ELTON JOHN WILL TAKE US TO MARS AND HERES WHY......
$GME closed at 325 today. 

You know whos birthday is on 03/25? My mothers girlfriend Elton John. 
Over Elton Johns Career he was nominated for 27 Grammys and won 4. 
27/4= 6.75 
On November 10th GME filed a form 8-k issuing the redemption of notes worth 125 million at 6.75%ROR
You know what else happened on November 10th
ELTON MOTHERFLIPPIN JOHN began his world tour at the Perth Arena for the 40th anniversary of ROCKETMAN!!! 
.
.
.
AND FOR THAT IM IN.............
This is not financial advice I went to Publix school.

Title: [GME] Lets do some math. I know its hard, but hopefully it helps?

Latest data says the short float is around 113%. Lets call it 110% to be conservative and make math easier
[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194252674953219](Teacher would be pissed im using a tweet as reference material. S3)
Shares outstanding 69.75 million. But we care about the float so 46.89M Lets call it 47 because math is hard
[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/](Yahoo Data)
Current interest rate says 32.8%. Again 33 is close enough
[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](Rick Roll)

So for hedge funds that are short what would it take to cover? Pretty simple from the yahoo data 47M shares in the float * 1.1% short = 51.7M shares shorted * 313 our current stock price = 16.182B $ lets call it 16.2B to cover all the outstanding shorts

$16,200,000,000 to cover all outstanding short positions based on current stock price

On the other side how much is this costing the shorts in total per day? 
For each share: 313 * .33 = 103.3 $ per year per share / 365 = .283 $ per day/share * 51.7M = 14,630,000 a day
Or since rounding might screw us and lazy (313 * 51,700,000 * .33) / 365 = 14,630,000. Hooray it doesnt

$14,630,000 being spent per day on interest payments

This seems to leave them with a choice. 
1. Wait it out because it will take 3 years to pay the same amount of interest that it would be to cover today while scalping shares along the way to slowly recover their position. In the meantime probably some intensive lobbying to see if they can change the rules to make being retarded illegal.

2. Cover, which based on what we have seen seems to scare the shit out of them. 

Tl;dr What does all this mean? Fuck if I know, I would bet they are going to try their hardest to wait this out and let it blow over and play whatever dirty tricks possible to keep from being forced to cover and send us to the moon. Either way best way to get #2 to happen is to HOLD YOUR DAMN SHARES AND DONT LET THEM SLOWLY RECOVER. 

Im letting my shares ride, im either going to be a whaler on the moon or im back to 0.

Something about financial advice, but this is just math, do whatever the hell you want with your own damn money

Title: PSA: please consider this about GME
Saw a post earlier listing the top shareholders in GME and yes, in addition to Cohen, there are some major firms.  These firms are not stupid and have likely made substantial gains.  They have obligations and will likely begin (if they havent already) unloading some of these positions to lock in the profit.  

This will cause millions of shares to hit the market and this may throttle the speed of GMEs inevitable meteoric rise

Anyways 

Tl;dr - well plateau for a bit before mooning, be patient and keep buying

Title: Regarding Robinhood (Please read).
Guys, I know we are mad at RH. I am fucking pissed about it. But please hear me out.  


The biggest factor in this succeeding is us having the ability to buy and sell our shares. The institutionalists have identified an issue with our strategy. This is our NUMBER ONE ISSUE. Diamond hands do not mean shit if brokerages are not able to process our orders and we are not able to effectively do what we are trying to do.  


This is the master plan. Raise capital requirements on brokerages. RH, the primary platform for this type of trading, runs out of capital and limits orders. We get pissed, and pull capital. This turns into a cycle, further hurting RH and our ability to operate.  


I know we are all mad at RH. We can discuss this when the dust settles. What needs to happen right now for this to continue is RH needs to sure up its funds. Switching to other brokerages isn't the solution. If RH goes belly up, guess whos name those shares are in, and guess who gets to buy them at liquidation prices.  


RH is ride or die. Vlad needs to tell us what he needs to open this up full bore, and we need to do everything we can to get them the money.

Title: The big scandal: Some explanations &amp; why trading got halted.
Citadel &amp; Point72 bailed out Melvin Capital which was the GME short selling bagholder, but it does not end here.

There are other short sellers. And these stocks, not just GME , but others too, became extremely volatile and on giant volume.

So first there is the issue of liquidated funds that do not have immediate cash.

They hold positions and would have to unwind them to get cash to cover their margin calls.

Melvin Capital I read was down 30% and got bailed out, so they still have assets, just not liquid, no immediately available cash.

Trust me, if they had a gun to their head they'd have immediately available cash, they'd manage.

Second, even after what happened in 2007-2009, financial institutions with systemic risk are not THAT capitalized.

It's not new and never gets solved: in 1987 NYSE specialists had to bed big banks to provide them with more cash or the whole world would collapse.

And I think bureaucrats do not understand how this all works very well. No one does honestly. But bureaucrats are really clueless and under or overreact. Always.

It gets scary for the clearing firms when you have GME making $35 billion volume and going up 400% in 2 days, AMC making $20 billion and gap 300%, higher volumes than Apple and Amazon that are already higher than usual and on 100 times the volatility .

Interactive Broker CEO was the most honest in my eyes and in an interview with CNBC said they halted trading to protect their clients, the clearing houses, the market, and themselves. He said if they had not done it the short squeeze would have kept "going and going", so regulators &amp; brokers agreed to stop it all to "stop the losses".

Robinhood decided to re-open trading and the CEO pretended he halted trading of the very volatile stocks as routine like "oh didn't notice anything special was going on" .

Webull CEO said in an interview their clearing house told them they could not take trades anymore. I think they use another entity than Robinhood does.

Not sure why Robinhood halted buying (and not selling). There's really the need for an investigation here. I can't tell you what happened because we do not know.

&amp;#x200B;

My 2 cents:

Short sellers are still very strong on this stock, I think they might even have added, I don't know if they are friends with the clearing house but either way they (ch) get stuck in this game, and retail investors are understandably angry at getting blocked like this.

Brokers don't have billions to my knowledge with which they can cover counterparty risk and they have no contractual obligation to do so and I mean they're not santa claus.

My personal opinion is short sellers refusing to liquidate and take the L is the source of all risks and problems (most of it might be options that they can just hold? Not sure how this gets counted in short interest).

Maybe already the counterparty clearing firms got wiped clean, but regardless of this if the price skyrockets further and the bagholding shorts that refuse to close while they can end up being liquidated and margin called, it's truly over for the market. Everyone is going bankrupt, WSB crashed the world.

The counterparty providers risk is real, but I am not their accountant, I do not know how bad things are, and we don't know what actors (if any) are of good faith. It could be (it probably is) shorties refusing to take the L, putting the whole market at risk.

I think they are really worried the price gets to 5000. From the Peterffy ( IBKR ) interview they really expected this. And it might still happen.

Lehman Brothers, James Cordier, Melvin, same story. They get greedy, they refuse to get out, they get rekt.

And sometimes they get an unfair bailout, and are so deluded they actually think they got unlucky when they really messed up.

Title: $GME Fair Price DD
WSB,

As I see it there are 3 ways for this to end:

1. We continue to buy and drive the price up to where they finally give up, buy, and we agree to sell
2. They go bankrupt on interest
3. Retail investors give up and start selling

**WHY OPTION 1 IS OUR BEST BET**

Despite the desire to end all the hedge funds, Option 2 and 3 are not desirable for the majority here.  Option 3 will cause many to hold bags so I don't think I even need to address it.

Option 2 is terrible because the length of time.  It will take 3000+ days.  Here is the math/assumptions:

* Assume 50M shares short or 100% short ([the share float according to Fin Viz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME))
* Each day costs 25% APR on the stock price
* At $300 thats $300\*(.25/365)\*50m = $10M/day

According to [this article](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/short-sellers-sitting-on-19-billion-of-losses-on-gamestop-data-shows-2021-1-1030020684#:~:text=Steve%20Cohen's%20%2419%20billion%20hedge,lost%20about%2020%25%20in%20January) short sellers are losing 15%-20% so far this year.  And [according to S3](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/gamestop-short-sellers-are-still-not-surrendering-despite-nearly-20-billion-in-losses-this-year.html), short sellers on $GME have lost $20B to date.  If they lost 20% and it's worth $20B that puts there total assets at $100B at the start of the year with $80B left (i think this is fairly accurate as Citadel alone at [$33B coming into the year](https://www.citadel.com/about-citadel/#:~:text=Citadel%20named%20to%20Linkedin's%20Top,as%20of%20November%201%2C%202020)).  $80B/$10M = 8000 days to broke.  Now you can increase interest rate (we have heard 70% now) but that would still leave 3000-4000 days to finally bankrupt them + continually buying from our side.  Maybe it's shorter but do you really want this going on for weeks?

The other issue is new shorts entering continuing to fuel the flames.  Old shorts may go broke but new shorts remain.  It will continue to delay profit.  In fact it might even normalize the current price and we could see GME stay elevated like Tesla for a long time.  In other words you will make less and it will take longer.

And yet another issue is if some magical way we do bankrupt them we are relying on a settlement for them or for us.  Again long time delay, probably lower settlement.

**THE FAIR PRICE**

So if we go with option 1 how do we settle this?  Well if we bankrupt them thats $80B/50M shares = $1600/share.

To be a fair settlement and get out of this we need a middle ground.  Therefore I propose $1000/share.  We get the pleasure of a quick win/payout and they get to keep some of their assets.

**MY PROPOSAL**

1) WSB comes out with strong support on $1000/share price

2) Short sellers stop the attacks and let the buyers run it up to $1000

3) We all clear out and let the hedge funds sell back the shares at a normal price

If possible we need to get agreement for all shareholders to sell at $1000 and then hedge funds to redistribute at the prices they see fit.  Some mediation outside the market would be great.

**TL;DR**

* Above $1600 SP we will bankrupt everyone.  This is not our best interest given the time for settlement and likely less payout once settled
* $1000 SP gets us all out of here safely and next week

Thoughts?  Am I missing something?

Title: Realism is not pessimism, a prediction for my fellow smooth brains
Here's a previous post I made just before the short ladder started 
  
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6e4za/theyre_going_to_change_the_rules_on_you_take_your/ 
  
Next prediction, this weekend will be a flurry of activity with all the rich assholes. I honestly believe they will correct the entire market and essentially blame it on the GME situation. It will be spun as "consumer confidence is at an all time low due to the blatant manipulation" or some such bullshit.

Title: GME insider quiet period (v2 - insider blackout means no sales THRU EARNINGS)! 
Reposting on request from /u/TomatoeHaven

Citron said in his video that a squeeze cant happen if insiders keep selling, but insiders (likely) CAN NOT sell company issued stock because of end of fiscal quarter lockup/blackout period, which usually extends until earnings are reported (which is on 3/26!!)

TLDR - no insider selling means more  fuel because paper handed insiders cant give in to the shorts even if they wanted to.

Alright listen up. I did a quick search on WSB and didnt see any hits actually talking about what is known as a quiet period or blackout for corporate stock trades in relation to insiders selling their company issues GME stock.

You NEED to know this to understand one of the big points that Citron made is complete BS in the short term (insiders creating liquidity for shorts).

Im assuming that many WSBers have never received stock based compensation and may not know the general corporate governance rules around them that many (most/all?) companies impose on their insiders. Heres a quick education in that and a summary of what it (might) mean for GME.

Obligatory disclaimer: Im not a financial advisor and I am long GME.

First: what is stock based compensation?

This is exactly what it sounds like, when as part of your comp for being a good employee, you get some sort of stock with some sort of conditions attached. There are many different flavors of this that are important.

options - these give you the right to buy stock at some fixed price, known as a strike price, which may be significantly below than market value (good!). There are many different types of option (eg ISO, NQ), but at the end of the day most are a discount coupon for cheap below market stock values. These are common for preIPO companies. Youll see these in the world of SPACs, for example, as warrants.

RSU: restricted stock units - these are literally shares, given almost like cash. More common for post IPO companies.

PRSU: performance RSUs - usually tied to some job performance goal, such as hitting a certain amount of revenue or other measurable goal.

Almost all stock based compensation comes with conditions, such as complying with whatever is in the associated company stock/equity plan. These are usually things like time vesting, which simply means that you cant take stock and run but rather have to let it vest over a period of months/years.

From the wallst perspective, stock comp is reported as an expense, so youll see it in financial disclosures and investor presentations from time to time.

Second: how do companies ensure these incentives dont hurt them or other shareholders?

This is critically important. Besides making sure there are clear policies on vesting and such, companies need to make sure that insiders do not use their company granted stock to hurt themselves or other shareholders, by performing trades during times when the employees may have critical information that the public does not. 

This is usually wrapped up in an insider trading policy.

Now, when WSB usually thinks about insider trading, you may think some hot head exec tipping off their golf buddy that the stock is about to crash (or pop) and they should act accordingly. Yes, thats insider trading; however, there is a more mundane version which is insiders who might have a general idea if earnings are going to be good or bad and making trades of their own company stock to profit themselves.

To protect against that, companies will often place quiet periods / trading blackouts BEFORE THE END OF A QUARTER, often by weeks at a time, AND EXTEND THAT BLACKOUT THROUGH EARNINGS REPORT DAY.

READ: end of GME quarter is THIS MONTH, meaning it is incredibly likely that all GME issued stock owned by insiders is locked up under the corporate blackout.

This is almost certainly why you dont see RC or anyone else from GME saying anything right now, due to quiet period.

In practical terms, GME would likely partner with a trading platform to administer stock grants, such as E*TRADE (which is common). The stock admin at GME would communicate blackout dates to E*TRADE (in this example), and During these dates, all of the sell functions in that stock plan account would be disabled.

READ: GME insiders see their stock plan values going through the roof right now, and CAN NOT SELL because of corporate blackout. This means the shorts cant cover with insider liquidity like Citron said.

Since these blackouts usually extend thru earnings, and that is weeks/month away, those shares would be unavailable to bail out the shorts for paper handed insiders.

SUMMARY
Citron said short squeeze cant happen when insiders are selling .... Insiders (very likely) cant sell because of end of quarter blackout. 

This should be common knowledge for Citron and other shorts. Anyone else on here who has dealt with stock based comp, please do sanity check me here and Im happy to edit and refine.

Edit: This is  fuel , since this means yet more of the outstanding shares that are inaccessible to cover shorts.

Title: The case for shorting RH's IPO
The CEO is a vampire called Vlad
The name of the company is ironic
Their mission statement is ironic
All thier users will switch to another brokerage

I think my case study runs deeply and my thesis will create many new retarded millionaires if we all follow.

Disclaimer: this is not financial advise, I am not an analyst.

Also I hate the company, and will never like their stock. Will always short it and place put options until it's worthless. $0.01 is the price I want to see thier stock ones it IPOs

Title: THE REASON BEHIND high Short interest and why there is the only way to squeeze.
&amp;#x200B;

Ok, before I retire to my weekend, I have to let you know why I do believe this battle can be won by us only one way and why there is right now more likelihood short sellers can win. 

You know that the Short interest ratio has not changed much and it is still above 100%. And you also know probably borrowing rate for short sellers is &gt;30% per annum, meaning you short 100$, if you keep it for 1 year, you will pay the lender &gt;30$ in interest.

Ok, we have to remember this! Not the same short-sellers might stay in this game forever. Some get in, they get hurt, they get out, someone else takes the rein, meaning not one single hedge fund will pay &gt;30% rate per annum on fees.  They believe this will blow over very soon 1-2 months max, they will pay 5-6% on that shorted stocks but if GME goes down, they will probably make 50-60 maybe 90%. If GME goes up to 600$ they will short at that price, if it foes to 800$ they will short at that, overall one day they believe (and that day they believe is not 1 year but few months ahead, they will make a ton of money). Therefore, you see SHort interest has not changed much, some have covered, but others have stepped in, believing that the current price is too high, they can make money at this level. 

 They believe this is a beautiful asymmetric risk and reward trade based on historical short squeezes. take the example of VW. Google it. 

TAKEAWAY and ONLY WAY TO SQUEEZE:  ONLY WAY WE CAN REALLY SQUEEZE THEM OUT IS TO HOLD THIS STOCK FOR MONTHS TO COME, NOT 1 or 2 months but maybe 1 YEAR! The only way to bleed them out is to make sure they are shorted for the long term, they pay borrowing rates, and also, REMEMBER, every quarter they have to send letters to their CLIENTS explaining how their portfolio did. WE HAVE TO KEEP THIS for FEW QUARTERS so that when their investors see their performance, they will either pull the money out or force them to cover! THIS IS LONG TERM GAME guys. YOU have to hold it even if it passes 1000$! THEY BELIEVE this will be over SOON, they will make a ton of money on their shorts and they will be able to show great returns to their clients. WE HAVE TO HOLD IT! LONG TERM! THIS IS THE ONLY WAY! 

If you don't hold it at least for 1- 2 quarters, the game will be won by the last short sellers.

Title: The Case for Rolls-Royce (RYCEY)
Whats up everyone, I want to share a stock with you that I think has the possibility to moon VERY soon: Rolls-Royce ($RYCEY). This will be longish, oh well. Im bored. And drunk. 

This isnt the RR company that makes those fancy cars, this a major league British Aerospace Company who is responsible for making a lot of engines for airplanes, land-based generation, and sea-faring ships. Im an engineer who works on gas turbines. Everyday. I know this field, and Rolls Royce is a HUGE player. Seeing the stock at $1.40 shocked EVERYONE I work with. I even had to show one of them how to buy a stock JUST so he could buy $RYCEY.

I believe they have the possibility to more than triple in the next year. Since you simpletons like bullets, here they are:
1.	It recently closed at less than $1.40/share. This is INSANE. It makes the companys value only $11.2 billion while they have an enterprise value of $17.4 billion!! For those Graham/Buffet investors, this is a WIN!
2.	Yes they are burning through cash as their gas turbine engines sit on the sidelines and orders are reduced BUT, they still have a HUGE foothold in the Aerospace door. Not only that, but their financials are actually pretty good. They recently reported $9 billion in liquidity which is an ample amount of cash to get them through 2022 (when air travel will likely pick back up)
3.	The huge amount of engines already in service makes them yachtfuls of cash. They actually make a lot of money on high-margin service on these engines.
4.	Management recently decreased the expected flight hours for 2021 (From 70% of 2019 to 50% of 2019). While yes this is technically bad for RR, I believe it to have already been priced in since the stock slid from a high of $9.30 to $1.40. Meaning the constant downward pressure on RR is a serious overreaction.
5.	They have an EXLUSIVE contract to supply engines to the airbus A350. Betting against air travel in the long term is ridiculously stupid, even for us.
6.	Management is decreasing their personnel and restructuring their business in an. Interesting way. They signed a contract with the UK Space Agency to research nuclear power in space. They are LITERALLY going to the moon. The new management is trying to expand into high-margin areas like space tech. 
Their restructuring plan is scheduled to return $750 million of positive free cashflow by the end of 2021.  This is HUGE. A company that is undervalued by $8 billion and likely to have positive cash flows in the next 12 months. 

 I can seriously keep going and plan on writing more as I have the time to. For now I have 1000 shares of RYCEY @ $1.39. Do with this information as you wish. This is not financial advice. I am not a financial adviser. Find your own damn stocks.

Title: AMC - What is happening &amp; future?
Mom To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Todays target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when theyre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isnt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and theres a lot more room to grow. On the high end were talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday.

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because its going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at its highest.

Title: IPOE/SoFi the death of Robinhood
Ok you degenerates. Ive been a lurker for a long time but I finally have some DD that I think is full proof.

I know GME and other stocks have been taking the spotlight, and for good reason. But all of that aside for one second, I want to talk about SoFi.

SoFi is a commission free app that does investing, lending, credit, and student loan refinancing. They have adaptive AI to manage your investments (which you can modify to your liking) or take a hands on approach thats where the real fun is anyways.

But if you are new to investing, or say you are struggling with student loan debt all you need is SoFi. Its as just as easy as Robinhood but actually has entire other subsections dedicated to helping the user make smart financial decisions and establish credit.

When I discovered SoFi, I immediately said What the fuck... why havent I heard of this? I have literally never heard of this app before and was amazed by everything it could do. Robinhood, while easy and simple, lacks anything near SoFis AI portfolio management and loan refinancing. SoFi is essentially having a financial advisor in your pocket.

Did I mention that SoFis loans have ZERO HIDDEN FEES. This is because the company is managed by the famous Chamath Psomethjng. 

Now you are probably thinking, Hey! Ive seen that Chamath guy on the TV recently! And you would be correct. Chamath Partyanjmal is the populist billionaire behind SoFis entire philosophy. We all know Robinhood is full of shit when they say they want to democratize finance for all. But SoFi is ACTUALLY DOING THAT!! 

https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354947541863780365?s=21

Its January 29, 2021. GME is roaring to the skies. Robinhood is in deep shit. Now you can factor in todays historical context into this company. You might also notice $IPOE went up nearly 25% today, with another 4% after market. Institutions see the value in a populist billionaire with ties to Elon himself, and honestly Id probably just give this guy all my money based on how he talks about Wall Street. Chamath Pajamas is going to take $IPOE and SoFi to the moon, and the best part is HE NEEDS US TO DO IT. 

Tldr: Fuck Robinhood. Join SoFi. Commission free, lending, credit, student loan refinancing too. CEO is young chad Chamath Pjamapants. This things got the whole shabang.

Title: My GME Exit Strategy
Hello retards and degenerates,

&amp;#x200B;

Congrats on holding the line above $320 today. 

&amp;#x200B;

As sad as it is, some of us would like to exit our GME position at some point in our lives. To strategize for this, I decided to do some quick math.

&amp;#x200B;

As most of you degenerates know, VW temporarily became the most valuable company in the world in the great squeeze of '08. Well, why can the same not happen to GME? Surely, some will argue about the difference in the underlying financials between the two stocks. But to that, I ask, was VW ever shorted by 140%? Fuck no.

Let's do some quick math.

&amp;#x200B;

Apple is the worlds most valuable company, at $2.215T.

GME has 69.75M shares outstanding

For GME to become the world's most valuable company, each share should be worth at least:

$2.215T / 69.75M = **$31,756 per share**

&amp;#x200B;

Given the historical precedent of major squeezes becoming the world's most valuable company, I will be setting my limit value at **no less than $30,000 per share.**

&amp;#x200B;

$1000 is not a meme. $5000 is not a meme. $10,000 is not a meme. and even $30,000 is not a meme.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not a financial advisor and I do not recommend you follow some blind retard hoping to change his family's life at the expense of these greedy fucks. All views are my own and again, I am retarded so do not follow my advice, I am simply explaining my own personal strategy.

Title: Here is why RKT might be a good move
Ive been looking at rocket mortgage and this is what i see: 

if the name of the company being a  isnt enough:
P/E ratio is only 2.6x  - 
Short interest nearing 40% - 
Above 20% borrowing rate, which makes it more expensive to borrow over time -
Lock up period ends 2/02 but most shares held by the board -
2 major catalysts coming: 1. Super Bowl for brand exposure and 2. earnings, which theyll blow out of the water, everyone and their mom refinanced their mortgage -  
Cherry on top: Biden administration likely to push home ownership 

tldr: RKT moon
21c 3/12 
200 shares

Title: If GME squeezes, TSLA will dip HARD. Don't forget to buy the dip.
GME squeezing will cause a 20-30% market correction as the liquidity necessary to cover all the short positions is obtained by selling off other positions in the market. The only day this week that the indexes closed higher than they opened was the day where Robinhoes restricted trading, because on the other days short sellers had to meet their growing margin requirements by selling other stocks. This, coming just after Tesla's earnings miss and the fact that it's a major component of the S&amp;P 500 AND is considered to be a huge bubble by institutions, will literally drive Tesla stock into the dirt. Unfairly, mind you, because my price target for them is still $1600. Frankly, that target is conservative.

You're going to have the opportunity to get relatively cheap LEAPS on something that will triple in the next four years. So buy the fucking dip. Roll over all your GME gains and own a piece of the best EV/Renewables/Tech company of this century.

Elon will take us all to Tendie town again. Squeeze GME and use the hedge fund's own money to monopolize the future of our economy and country.

Some of you may have read (or seen because you cannot read) my post yesterday about a Gamma squeeze today.  ([1/29/21 - The Great Battle For Valhalla](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7b6t7/12921_the_battle_for_valhalla_gammainfinity/))  While I believe a Gamma squeeze in fact occurred, it was curtailed and did not catalyze the MOASS (Mother of All Short Squeezes) because brokerages like ROBINHOOD intentionally limited our ability to buy shares/apply pressure to the shorts *AKA* Melvin Capital *AKA* Citadel LLC.

**BUT WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN LIEUTENANT** u/Brassmonkeynutzz**????**

Ok.  Let's start with the basics for all of you who are wet behind the ears.  What is a Gamma squeeze you ask?  A Gamma squeeze occurs when option sellers/market makers buy shares of the underlying stock to hedge their positions/prepare for the possibility that call option buyers decide to exercise their right to buy.  This type of hedge is necessary when a significant amount of call option strikes are expiring in the money (last week **all** available strikes expired in the money on a stock for the first time in financial history and this week a shit load of strikes expired in the money as well).  

Wait, you aren't actually reading this are you?  If you are, I appreciate you.  For those of you who cannot read (all of you), please see the **TL;CR** at the bottom of this post.  (Hint: )  

Anyways, you might be wondering, why would Robinhood risk its reputation and entire business by limiting its customers ability to buy?  Simple: "Robinhoods regulatory filings show the company charges large investment firms called market makers (**CITADEL/MELVIN**) fees to access real-time information about which stocks its users are buying and selling, a practice some regulators and industry watchers have seen as a potential conflict of interest."  In fact, "Robinhood routes more than half of its customer orders to Citadel, by far its largest market-making partner by volume, Robinhood [disclosures](https://robinhood.com/us/en/about/legal/) show." ([Source 1](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/robinhood-and-citadel-e2-80-99s-relationship-comes-into-focus-as-washington-vows-to-examine-stock-market-moves/ar-BB1ddG06))  

In other words, Robinhood is more concerned about saving the **GAY BEARS**  that they are in bed with (their real customers - **CITADEL/MELVIN**) than servicing retail investors like us.  Ironically, Robinhood is taking from the poor and giving to the richit is ass backwards. 

Before, I go any further, I have to once again congratulate all of the true autists who have diamond handed thus far.  Thank you for holding.  You are truly retarded and I salute you.  And of course, I salute our King, u/DeepFuckingValue, with the utmost respect.  We fought valiantly in "The Great Battle for Valhalla" today.  And it is very promising that **EVEN DESPITE** Robinhood limiting our retarded power, we went from closing at 196 yesterday to 328 at close today, and 312 as I write this post.  But clearly, this infinity war is far from over.  

If you sold like a paper handed pussy , then you are not a true WSB autist soldier.  You are not one of us.  Go invest in an ETF and leave this sub forever!

**But I am a true autist, what can I do?**  

First things first, GTFO of Robinhood immediately if you do not have options expiring within the next week and transfer your portfolio to literally any other brokerage.  They are fucking criminals and they are trying to delay/mitigate the MOASS.  I am personally transferring to webull unless you tards have a better suggestion.

For those of you who were clenching when we got down to around 126 yesterday and around 250 today.  I know you were scared.  But the following cannot be overstated: **THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT! FEAR!!!!!**  

**JUST FUCKING HOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**  THEY WANT YOUR FUCKING SHARES SO BAD BECAUSE THERE IS A HUGE SHORTAGE.  **HOLD THE MOTHERFUCKING LINE AND WE RIDE TO VALHALLA!**

[HODOR ](https://preview.redd.it/f3nz7nay7de61.jpg?width=275&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5758f311d4a39c78208f5c10478e794c385d7a12)

Shortage?  YES A FUCKING SHORTAGE.  Over 100% shares are still shorted.  Do not listen to anyone who says Melvin Capital has closed out their short position.  That is total bullshit.  

But, but, but, WhY iS CNBC AdVeRtIsInG tHaT MeLvIn ClOsEd iTs sHoRt pOsItiOn tHeN ?  ([great post talking about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8539h/cnbc_now_running_ads_promoting_that_melvin/))  I mean seriously, ask yourselves, why the fuck would CNBC run paid advertisements about the shorts closing their positions?  BECAUSE THE BIG BOYS WANT YOU TO THINK THE SQUEEZE IS OVER SO YOU SELL AND GIVE UP.  **FEAR NOT;** **THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT SQUOZEN!**  

**Think about it:** if Melvin closed its short position, it would simply move on to the next trade and never look back.  There would not be any reason to ***pay*** to advertise that.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary:** the big dogs want you to think the squeeze is over, and they want you to panic and sell your shares.  DO...NOT...DO...IT!  Instead, **HOLD!  BUY THE DIP!  REPEAT!**

Title: $SPCE combines short squeeze hedge fund hate, long term hold diamond hands, rocket ships (like actual rocket ships), and mucho tendies...
oh it does, it does... I love listing them (none of these are guaranteed, but all are definitely in the works): ARKX debuts and takes a big position in SPCE , they announce the date of the next test flight , the price hits $50 causing more short squeeze , the TestFlight goes off without a hitch , it lands safely on the ground , massive short squeeze because of successful flight , Branson goes to space , Justin Bieber goes to space , they build a second Spaceport , they build more spaceships , they build a hypersonic plane , start hypersonic transatlantic flights . All of this is already planned and could happen in the next 3-5 years!  (rocket ships = money printer goes brrrrttt)

Title: Pain Of Missing Out (POMO)
It hurts.
I was long GME before the revolt, for sound, logical reasons. I knew retail was hurting because of covid, but the company's valuation was ridiculously low. Only a few hundred mil mkt cap. Dirt cheap. I traded it from 6 to 7. Then from 9 to 12. Made a day trade for a few hundred bucks. 
Then wsb started talking about GME. And more GME. I became wary. "Reverse wsb" they said. I was still bullish when it was trading around and 20 bucks a share, but thought I'd play it safe. I sold a put and got exerciced. Sold it back to market to break even. Gme posts started flooding my reddit feed. Dd this, dd that. 
I never read the DD.
Pages and pages of posts, enough to fill a textbook. I didn't even want to hear what all the autists were saying. If I would've just read ONE of them posts about the short interest I would've been convinced to buy and hold. I'd be rich right now.
That is all.
I'm in pain, but I'm so happy and proud of this community. History was made these last few weeks.

Title: The Real Short that Could Collapse Establishment Hedges $SLV
This is the most important DD you will ever read.  I dont usually post here but this needs to be spread.If we can band together and understand how the silver markets are leveraged $SLV and other silver stocks could go absolutely flying.

Silver is the most manipulated and corrupted market in Wall Street. Big hedges have been suppressing the price for years to hide inflation from there corrupt friends at the FED and ultimately have leveraged hundreds of times more paper silver than actually silver in existence. 

Silver is in more demand then ever and the supply will only shrink. In silver highs the price in todays money would be 600$-1000$. And now it floats at 25$ when the highs in the 80s where in the 50$ range. It is so absurd and if we can all recognize this we truly could take down the entire establishment starting from the hedges down all the way to our corrupted federal reserve that has literally printed most of the money supply in the past year, which in theory should send silver flying to the moon but is being suppressed by the crooks on Wall Street to hide inflation and make you power.

TL;DR

BUY SILVER TAKE DOWN THE ESTABLISHMENT, something we all agree on. $SLV should literally be in the high hundreds if not thousands if we can all unite.

Title: You guys are actually understating how royally fucked Shorty is.
Imagine this, you're Shorty. Shorty is a politically connected trust fund asshole who got into Harvard/Yale on legacy. You never worked a day in your life, but your congressman/hedgefund daddy gets you a job at Citadel because your daddy is friends with the head muckity muck and then you go on to start a long/short hedge fund that invests in fruits. 

You want to buy a shiny apple at $120 thinking it will be $130, but you don't want to just buy a shiny apple with your own money - you want to buy the apple with someone else's money, so you borrow 3 oranges from some reddit retard who thinks you have his best interest at heart. You immediately sell the 3 oranges at $40 a piece to buy a shiny apple at $120. You do this because you think the apple is worth more and will appreciate more, but, you turn into a greedy asshole. You then go on TV and tell everyone that oranges are cancerous to scare people into getting rid of their oranges and bring the price down to $20 so that you only have to pay the reddit retard half of what you sold the oranges for. 

This works for a while. More greedy rich assholes follow your lead and sell to each other to the point where 40 retards sell their 40 oranges to these assholes, who sell to each other, making the total number of oranges outstanding 70.

This is ok, as long as the orange is worth less than the apple. You sold 3 oranges at $40 and bought a shiny apple and now the apple is worth 130 and the oranges are worth $20, so you made more than the $10 that increased in the value of the apple (130-20*3=70). 

However, something bad happens - Reddit retards notice not enough oranges exists to cover what you and your friends owe, so they decide to buy up all the oranges to raise the price of oranges. Unfortunately for you, this works. And now, oranges are worth 325... So what is your account worth? Negative.

How? You still owe 3 oranges, just they're now worth $195, and all you have is 1 shiny apple worth $130 to show for it. Your net position on this trade is now worth ($130-$585 = -$455)... Did I forget, that you are also paying 28% interest on the $455, only increasing the amount you owe day after day? You sweat, you panic, you tell your friend at CNBC to tell everyone everything is ok and that you closed your position when you know - you literally can't as you cry and shit yourself and avoid being seen in public as much as you can and keep ignoring you prime brokers phone calls asking for more margin, hoping Robinhood will save you, but they don't, and those oranges are now worth $320 each...

btw, not a financial advisor so you do you, booboo

#TLDR: HOLD AND BLEED SHORTY#

Title: Used tinder to get a bunch of dates at my local $AMC theater, hopefully this will bring up the stock price. 
Ok listen up you autists, there are almost 7 million people in this subreddit. About 70-80% of that 7 million are men - that means we have 5.25 million dudes on the sub. The average price of an $AMC movie experience is like 30 dollars if you include popcorn, ticket, and food. So if we all find a way to get a date (or 10) at our local $AMC theater we can drive up the revenue. Lemme do some quick maths.

If we average 1 date (per member) this weekend, we will have earned $AMC 236,250,000 in revenue. IN A SINGLE WEEKEND

How about an average of 5 dates per member?
1.18 billion in revenue

Now... if we were to get 10 dates ON AVERAGE in a single weekend at $AMC *drumroll please*
2.36 BILLION in revenue

Why only get tendies when you can get tendies and sex. See you crazy motherfuckers on the moon

Title: Hey fellow autist, check this out.
TLDR; Whales had too much for a century. This may be only chance for little guys to overcome whales.



# Stock Market In Its Default

For the past centuries of stock trading, riches has had most power on stocks. The idea that a stock can be traded on an expectation basis is a scam where big whales can bait little fishs money and start devouring on it. You may disagree with me but first lets consider an example.

A company makes $100 profit an year. The company IPOs with $1000 market cap. Whales hold 40% of the shares as initial bagholders.

* Case 1: nobody wants to trade the stock.  
If nobody traded any stock, the stock will sit sideways and no-one will gain or lose money. i.e. rich will not gain nor lose money.
* Case 2: the company is popular and people look to buy at IPO.  
Obviously in this case, stock prices will increase with little guys $110, $120 bid until riches start selling their stock at $200. If the stock gets sold back to $100, all of the little guys lost money while whales gained profit even when the stock price(our baseline case) has remained the same.
* Case 3: the company is performing poorly, and less people want the stock.  
In this case, rich people will sell for $100, $90, $80... and only little guys will buy in the stocks with decreasing stock price. The rich people who initially bought the stock in at $50 or less has still come out of profit while little guys lose money due to the decreasing stock prices.

See how whales as initial bagholders always win money!

Wait, this is too much math! I dont get it!  
Dont worry. Ill give a simple summary. Whales can initially invest in a company for a way lower price than us. Once the company IPOs they build up their wealth over little guys money flooding into the stock. Notice that stock market is ultimately a zero sum game, and odds are in favor of whales who had early invested in the company.


Some may argue the above is false given that more people tend to hold the stock over time with an expectation. Now, here is what is interesting.

* Let's consider a company which doesn't hold any debt or any liquidity. The company is 50% owned by whales. The company IPOs at $100 a share (at 20 PE).  
Notice that company holds no money nor debt. In reality, the company should be valued at 0. But whales who are the initial bagholders of this game can sell their 50% ownership at $100 a share due to the "expectation". This is the magic of turning $0 worth company into $100 a share company.
* But what if the company will worth more in 10 years? Then, whales who held onto the stock will be able to sell the stocks at 20PE after 10 years (whether it be $1000 or $10000).

Do you see the game here? The initial bagholders always come out of profit. They are the BANK of this system and will build up the wealth using the little guys. Moreover, the big guys tend to trade on a premature company information which gives them an advantage of early moves.

But, is this bad? NO. It's not a bad thing. It's just how market is built. Just remember, in an ordinary market, little guys will tend to lose money because the market is ultimately a zero sum. The initial investors will always come out better.


# GME, AMC, etc. Case

Now the story gets even more fascinating. In these stocks cases, whales were not the "initial bagholders". Instead, they held a short selling position of the stocks. Retails came in and bought the stocks, and became the "initial bagholders"

Do you remember from the above that initial bagholders always win? This is the case where initial bagholders were the retails. Whales didn't have time to get in or had the priority of getting the pre-IPO shares. Instead, their shorts will print money into the stocks as the move continues. Due to the short selling restrictions, whales who hugely shorted these stocks "MUST" continue purchasing the stocks, which will increase the stock prices even further.

We can apply this in a macroscopic view. If we think of GME as a market where one can invest and Citadel as a bank, then this is a case where the bank Citadel is always backing the GME market GME (unlimited QE) as long as preconditions are met. The precondition here is that share price has to be above the short strike price. Then, the market will only keep growing until the bank has no more money to print. Retails who are now the early investors, or "initial bagholders", will be for a first time bagholders of a giantly large market.


# Scenarios

* The best case is when retails continue buying/holding onto the stocks until Citadel's unlimited QE finally ends in the market. As long as the preconditions continue to meet, there will be unlimited QE for the GME market.
* The worst case is when retails panic sell the stocks and the stocks go to bottom. This will allowing Citadel to print money from their shorts, and it means that there is no unlimited QE. Only retails were hurt in the case.


# What I am doing

I am a retail myself and will obviously side with retails. I am also very angry especially at the stinky game going on behind the scenes of these trading platforms, and will not forgive them. I will continue HOLDing with my   until everyone to 


**Disclaimer: None of these are investment advice. Do your own research!**

Title: I'm sorry to bring a little attention away from GameStop But I really think we should look at CRSR next
They are currently 81% shorted and are a solid company. Earnings coming soon. Whole market down and just a handful of stocks green from last week...Corsair (CRSR) one of them

They've been trying to short corsair and keep it locked in for weeks. Probably to buy before earnings cheap. They deserve the real boost before earnings. I will admit if it goes up it would benefit me, but I also have been watching them short this for months and it's making me sick.


*Watch how quickly the billionaire short bots try to spam this with negative comments

Title: ~100% GME shares held by institutions. Still over 100% of the float is short. WE'RE THE CAPTAIN NOW
So I was doing some perusing and wondered, "How much of GME float do institutions own?" According to several sources its around 100%. Yahoo finance has it at 122%. Finviz has it at 95%. And Nasdaq has it at 110%.

([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME))

([https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME))

([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings))

Now I know what your smooth brain is telling you. "How can it be over 100%?". Well it can be for two main reasons. The first is differences in when companies report their holdings to the SEC, not everyone reports on the same day. The other reason is due to short selling. If institution A has their shares shorted to institution B, then both technically own stock in the company but its being counted twice when reported to the SEC. 

The other question on everyone's mind is, "How much of the float is still short?". According S3 Partners market data, after the close today we're still at 113%!!!

([https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755?s=20](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755?s=20))

So how does this all unfold? We've got an army of retards who won't sell for less than $69,420.00, what seems like almost 100% of the float owned by big institutions that can't sell their position all at once  (it's possible they've started selling some of their shares), and still over 100% of the float is short. I really have no idea but it seems like at this point no one who owns a share should have to sell at a loss.

**TL;DR: over 100% of GME float is held by institutions or retards who aren't gonna sell and there is still over 100% of the float being shorted. Flow just handed us the fucking Name Your Price Tool**

 DISCLAIMER: I have not given any financial advice and therefore fuck off

Title: The Short Swing Profit Rule - How GME Can Cash-In via RC Ventures
I see a lot of chatter right now about how GME's current stock price doesn't actually 'help' the company, which is, for the most part, true. 

In order for GameStop to actually benefit from this price movement, they would need to tap the capital markets, most likely by doing a stock offering near current prices. To do so, you need to have enough deep-pocketed investors who are willing to purchase at that price, not to mention increasing the float could significantly hurt the ongoing 'short squeeze' psychology. Yes, there are other ways to take advantage of the share price (all-stock acquisitions, etc.), but none of them are as straightforward as getting cash in hand.

However, there is one way for GameStop to use today's prices benefit the company financially: the Short Swing Profit Rule.

    The short-swing profit rule, also known as the Section 16b rule, is an SEC regulation that prevents insiders in a publicly traded company from reaping short-term profits.
    
    The short-swing profit rule requires company insiders to return to the company any profits made from the purchase and sale of company stock if both transactions occur within a six-month period.
    
    This rule applies to any shareholder, officer, or director who owns more than 10% of a class of the company's equity securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act.

Obviously Insider sales are tightly regulated, but *if* Ryan Cohen (aka RC Ventures) were to sell a portion of his 9,001,000 shares currently worth $2.8B (roughly 13% of the company), he would then be required to return those profits directly to the company. This would arguably be the best possible way to capitalize on the situation, providing positive news that in some ways might help substantiate the current valuation (I won't offer my own opinion here). 

tl;dr: Ryan Cohen (RC Ventures) can raise money for GME by selling and sacrificing his profits. These profits would help GME on the path to turning around the business, so this may be a win-win situation. 

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor, and everything I am telling you comes from the internet, so please do your own due diligence before making any investment decisions.

Title: AMC Short Squeeze Is Absolutely Possible to and Here is Why
I'm not a financial advisor I have positions in AMC and this is not a financial advice.

&amp;#x200B;

I see a lot of people shitting on AMC for being framed a "scape-goat" for GME shorts to divert us from GME.

There is no doubt that short squeeze is apparent in GME but let me explain why AMC shorts can also get FUCKED by recent events.

# 1. AMC Has a High Short Interest % [https://www.highshortinterest.com/](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)

AMC is #2 on the list with a whopping 78.97% of float being shorted. and looking at the % held by institutions( 37.24% ) and assuming that these institutions are long on the stock, we're looking a short to float percentage of about **116.21%.** 

If this is not enough to cause a short squeeze I don't know what will.

# 2. AMC Got 2 Big Unexpected News.

Just like how Ryan Cohen's involvement has started this crazy investing phenomena, AMC has also receive a bunch of unexpected news that caught the ears of boomer investors. 

Recently it has received a lot of funding to not go bankrupt and even wiped off their debt by diluting shares. This was a great move as many investors will be looking forward to hop in for brighter prospect of the company. Plus with the vaccines being released AMC will get back on their feet in no time. Also, since they recently raised money by diluting shares and wiping away their debt, there won't be more share dilution in the near future.

Lastly, with the whole GME scandal, it received soooo much coverage on media and the public  which is only going to hurt the shorts. 

# 3. New Shorts are In The House

If you look at [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/amc](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/amc) and [https://fintel.io/ss/us/amc](https://fintel.io/ss/us/amc) The shares available to short has gone down significantly. JUST 4 days ago the short availability was at **7 million** and now this morning it went all the way down to **500**(0 on fintel). 

This means a lot of shorts possibly jumped in due to the recent jump in the stock price. However, what they don't realize is that this is an unprecedented time where millions of retailers are buying the stock to HOLD...because they like the stock. Not to bring down corrupt hedge fund fuckers of course. 

# 4. GME Steam Has Cooled Off a Bit

I know I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this last point but, personally, I think GME has potentially gone up to a point where retailers are not hopping in as much because of the high stock price but the ones who already got in are holding/adding to force the shorts to cover. This could explain why it really hasn't moved all that much in the past 2 days(except when it went down to like $132) despite people saying there will be a gamma squeeze today.

AMC is sitting at $13.00 as of now and it is at a relatively more "desirable" price for normal people to hop in. Psychologically it FEELS better to hold 30 stocks than 1 stock.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not suggesting you should sell GME and buy AMC but I can see about 5x return on AMC and about 3x return on GME in the near future. and I like to make more money so my money goes to AMC. I can write about how I got those 3x and 5x but that's for next time.

Title: DON'T BUY OTM CALLS
Buying OTM Calls for next week is not only not necessary but will also just delay squeeze. If there is a ton of activity on OTM calls and the HF's have the ability to dictate price (which we now know they can) because volume is so low due to all of us holding, they will easily have the ability to make sure the OTM stuff expires worthless, which would just buy them more time. At this point isn't it just a waiting game and buying any dips they create? I see this trading sideways (minus their ladder attacks/buybacks) for a while till they decide they are done bleeding out. Tell me if I'm retarded.

Title: AMC now has the second most short interest behind GME!
First and foremost, GME to the fucking moon 

I'm proud of the diamond hands and dedication from the WSB gang despite these criminal tactics from brokerages like Robinhood. If you have any extra funds or take profits on GME when it hits $10K on Monday, be sure to catch the next rocket ship on AMC.

AMC is now reported to have the second most short interest of any stock on the market (78.97%), behind only GME.

How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man? Let's squeeze the shit out of these motherfuckers!

AMC to $100 next week 

We like games. We like movies. WE LIKE THESE STOCKS.

Positions: Loaded to the tits with $3, $17.5, $30, and $40 Strike February 5th Calls and Shares.

Title: A case for why we are reaching $69,420
I have been a professional autist for almost a year now, and I can see the charts like a chart jedi. A Chedi.

The shorts had pushed the GME down to a price of $4 when this epic ran began. 

Starting in August when buying began it took approximately 150 days until Mid January for the stock to raise by an exponent of 2. 
4^2=16.

Since then it has taken approximately the square root of 150 days, 12 days,  for it to raise by an exponent of 2 again. 
16^2 = 256. 

That was todays low and where our support line stands. 

If this exponential function is extrapolated beyond today it suggests that in the square root of 12 days the price will be 256^2.

In 3 1/2 days, Tuesday afternoon, the price will be $65,536 per share!!

I think it is safe to round that up to $69,420!!!

Title: Back with an update on SPWR (After this GME squeeze is over move your attention to SPWR )
[Here is my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l49vw4/solar_stocks_abs_green_energy_stocks_will/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

For you autists: 

Luckily SPWR did not get dumped after Biden had his climate speech on Wednesday which showed great strength. Spwr has been doing really good under current market conditions and I still believe this stock will hit $100+ in the long term. 

Im not going to repeat what I said in my last post so fuck you go read my last post. I originally had a target of roughly $63 which we still have not hit but we are still looking good for it and if we break that resistance I think we are headed to 3 digits. 

Some info you guys might like: [Short interest on SPWR is still high at 57% ](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SPWR/short-interest/)

Especially after today as well we ended at $54 and a lot of puts expired under. Im not talking no squeeze but this stock is going to continue to do well for reasons mentioned in my [last post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l49vw4/solar_stocks_abs_green_energy_stocks_will/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Title: GME Short Float: S3, FactSet, and Bloomberg ALL show above 100%
Only one thing I have to add: 

I saw some people question the S3 number. I dont know where S3 Partners gets their data but both Bloomberg and FactSet report short interest of 61,782,730. 

They differ slightly on float but are close: Using FactSet numbers, float is 73.2% of, per 13G filed with SEC yesterday, The percentage is calculated based upon total outstanding shares of 69,746,960, as of December 1, 2020, as set forth in the Issuers Form 10-Q, filed on December 8, 2020. 
https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119312521019848/0001193125-21-019848-index.htm

61,782,730/(69,746,960*.732)=121% SHORT FLOAT

AMAZINGLY Short Interest actually increased in several names today:

https://imgur.com/gallery/jDyjiyT

BY ALL AVAILABLE ACCOUNTS GME SHORT INTEREST REMAINS ABOVE 100 AND SI IN OTHER HEAVILY SHORTED NAMES HAS ONLY INCREASED. 

THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT EVEN STARTED. 
  

Title: BB is a GOOD COMPANY
Im hearing a lot of worry about BB, and I want to set the record straight. Obligatory .

Firstly, they are dipping their entire ballsacks into excellent sectors (EV, Cybersecurity, Automation), but they are collaborating with excellent companies (Amazon, Baidu). 

Secondly, before all of this, BB was doing great. Up from $4 to $6/$7, high volume green days, low volume reds, healthy regression from the mid $8s. They hype surrounding BB can only make it better, and this baby is going places no matter what.

Bottom line, hold the fucking line, buy more, sit back and relax. It may not be the short squeeze of the goddamn century like GME, but theres enough short interest for hedge funds to want to fuck with BBs prices. The only place to go is up, we simply decide how long it takes.

I am not a financial advisor, I am a retard who LIKES THE STOCK

Title: AMC to the moon 
AMC still remains as the top 10 most shorted stock. Volume today was 587.7m shares versus average volume of 83m and the stock jumped 53.65%. This tells me based on technical factors of volume and short interest that the squeeze still hasnt occurred and support prices above todays current closing price of $13.26. Unfortunately I cant find the exact short % relative to float but based on fintel, shorts still have lots of covering to do. Lastly, AMC still hasnt reached late 2018 prices.

TLDR: AMC to the 



Edit: This is not financial advice.

Title: Be cautious if youre in AMC.
AMC is NOT a squeeze.  Here are some numbers for AMC and comparably, GME.

AMC
Shares shorted: 44.67m

Total shares outstanding: 287.28m (available altogether)

Float: 101.95m (available on market)

Short % of float: 38.12%

Short % of outstanding: 20.67%

The short interest is not even CLOSE to the outstanding shares, and not even HALF of the float.  This is obviously fabricated to look like a 'squeeze' as institutions hold a fair majority of the shares.

37.4% of shares are held by institutions like Citadel, Melvin etc.  

These guys WANT you to throw money at AMC and get out of GME so they can bring the price down and save their ass.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/key-statistics/
(I know obligatory fuck yahoo and DD)


Now lets look at some GME numbers

GME

Shares shorted: 61.78M

Total shares outstanding: 69.75M

Float: 46.89M 

Short % of float: 226.42%

Short % of outstanding: 88.58%

Just to keep the data impartial I used yahoo for these numbers as well.  Even if I personally believed yahoos were accurate, we can easily identify that GME is in a massive short squeeze.

I am retarded, and do not constitute this as financial advice.

Title: GAMESTOP WONT STOP CANT STOP GREW E-COMMERCE REVENUE 309% 
I know you all are terrible at percents, and the only statistics you understand involve your wives and girlfriends banging other men at statistically improbable rates, but look at THIS:

GAMESTOP GREW ITS E-COMMERCE REVENUE 309% YoY last year. 

https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-2020-holiday-sales-results

This groundswell of retards LIKING THE STOCK is the best marketing campaign EVER. WSB now has 6M users. Lets say half of them buy video games, that is 3M people who will now exclusively buy from GameStop.

E-Commerce companies trade at high tech multiples, as opposed to seedy mall location video game store multiples. The biggest cost to e-commerce is marketing. It is all about thin margins, and more sales, driven by digital marketing campaigns. Maybe the entire physical mall footprint of GameStop is worthless, but people start downloading their call of duty through GameStop, or they partner with activision or EA. The brand name and popularism now has a huge intangible value. 

This is the thing I keep thinking about  if something like DOGCOYN, a literal joke, created as a joke, can have a $10B market cap from retail buying, why cant a company like GME that trades like PEOPLE LOVE IT have a market cap of $50B if the masses decide and the momentum institutions follow? GME is absurd in terms of the speed, but not in terms of the market cap relative to other absurd crap. 

I AM AN INTERNET RETARD WHO EATS CRAYONS BUT I LIKE THIS STOCK



Title: GME DD; Meta factors at play
We all know GME is gonna moon when this squeeze happens but it would have happened sooner if Robinhood wasn't market manipulating.   


They froze trading and made it so you could only sell, creating downward pressure to try to bail their unironically retarded buddies at the hedge funds out. They limited share buying whenever the stock would start to spike. They are SCARED.   


But like a spy removing his mask to move in for the kill, Robinhood has exposed themselves! They cannot be trusted, and anyone with a brain is moving to a new trading platform (Ameritrade, Etrade, Schwab, etc). We didn't see this pan out in the market today because it takes time to transfer funds and open new accounts. BUT, we're going into the weekend, and on monday, those new accounts should be open and funded.   


We're going to see a huge surge of pissed off ex-Robinhood traders coming at GME like a Karen to a manager who just got 2 tendies in her 3 piece tendy meal. The squeeze is happening and on MONDAY, there's going to be even more buying pressure than ever, on top of short covering. This rocket ship is going UP              


Also, if you haven't gotten off Robinhood yet, DO IT! Take all your money that isn't in GME shares already (because you better be holding mother fucker!) and put it elsewhere. Robinhood deserves to lose their entire customer base for this.   


ALSO SHOUT OUTS TO ALL MY RETARDS AND AUTISTS THAT HELD TODAY, WE'RE WINNING BACK THE TENDIES THAT WE'VE BEEN DENIED SO LONG!

Title: Three Scenarios We Win; One Scenario We Lose
At the current stage it appears there are four potential ways this plays out.

&amp;#x200B;

**Brokers Stay Locked Down Indefinitely:**

This is basically the only scenario I see Wall Street winning in. In this case they slowly buy up shares while eliminating any external buying pressure and reducing the market to low volume selling pressure.

&amp;#x200B;

I find this to be rather unlikely due to the utter shitstorm of a response brokers received yesterday.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Everyone Holds Indefinitely**

Very similar scenario to above but we all hold until brokers are forced to return to normalcy. Shorts burn billions a day. Eventually they cave. We win.

&amp;#x200B;

Idk how likely this is. Prisoner's Dilemma and all.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Brokers Fix Their Shit Soon**

If brokers fix their shit and return to normal there will be a huge influx of buying launching the price to the moon. Shorts will have to cover. We win

&amp;#x200B;

This is the ideal scenario and arguably the most likely given regulatory pressure.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some Combination of the Above**

With some combination of the above where we limit selling pressure and brokers slowly return to normalcy while shorts continue doubling down we may see a long, drawn out Tesla-like squeeze.

&amp;#x200B;

I rate this similarly likely to "**Brokers Fix Their Shit Soon**"

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, we win in three out of four scenarios.

I'd put rockets but I'm retarded and don't know how on a laptop.

&amp;#x200B;

Disclosure: I am not a financial professional. In fact, I am deeply retarded. This is not financial advice. Don't listen to me. I own 13 shares of $GME at a $54 average.

Title: Todays threshold (not financial advice)
Looking at options chains with 0DTE, it looks like the next big threshold to cross is $320. I expect that if we end today above that price, well see a big bump in AH trading. 

https://www.stockoptionschannel.com/symbol/?symbol=GME&amp;month=20210129&amp;type=call

The volume of nearly 15k calls expiring today means that if we end the day where we currently are, $325 at the time of this post, we can expect volume to spike as those are all exercised. So long as we can stay at this level, theres going to be another nice green day for all the  on Monday. 

Heres to tendies for all, Ill see you in Valhalla 

Obligatory: this is not financial advice. I just really like this stock

Title: Palantir Recruitment
Since we gained a lot of new members over the past 2 weeks I figured it is time to introduce you all to a company that is only at the beginning of its life cycle.

Palantir technologies was started 17 years ago by a seed investment from In-Q-Tel, the venture capital arm of the CIA. They absorb the troves of data that people generate and turn that data into actionable items. They are the ones who found Osama Bin Laden, they are Big Brother. 

Companies are accumulating vast amounts of data knowing that one day it will be valuable. I recently read the JetBlue privacy policy while bored on a flight - would have helped if maybe they put some pictures in it. They wanted you to connect your phone to the iPad in the back of the seat to use as a remote. Once you clicked accept on those terms of service, you gave jetblue the right to collect your phones location history, your (well not technically yours, that's why all this is legal) retinal imaging data, facial recognition data, fingerprint data, web browsing history, olfactory data...whatever they want. They place cookies, pixels, web beacons, everything on your phone. FB's new privacy policy allows them to use your camera to see where your eyes go, your account activity for ANY account you log in to (banking info, cell phone records, car payments, onlyfans, brazilian fart porn, whatever youre into). These companies and many governments are building data lakes so that they can begin analyzing that data to see where the goose fits in with the gander.

Many companies have the data, but few have the ability to transform it into something valuable. Peter Thiel, the Don of the PayPal mafia, is a cofounder of this company. His philosophy is that no competition is the best competition. He strives to create monopolies. This industry will be huge, the TAM is hard to estimate but it may extend to even bigger metrics, like national security. The next world war will be a war of information and technology, and the US cant afford to fall behind. 

You know why google is so valuable. They are information brokers. They live and breathe off of collecting your data and selling, because it is very very valuable. Palantir is a multiplier of this value. Their plug and play solutions are an easy value add and save companies from having to create internal divisions of autists that mine this data and maybe turn it into something useful that can generate money.

This company has potential to be the next Google. They are the first mover, and being private and obscure until they perfected their systems may allow them to become the last mover as well. 

They recently had DPO'ed, preventing the big boys from moving in and buying large portions. Lockup ends 3 days after their upcoming ER. One of our fearless leaders Cathie Wood (btw where can I get an application to be her pool boy) has been steadily accumulating.

They are positioned to become the standard when talking about big data and AI. I highly recommend you do some research now (maybe start by googling ex employees who are now in high levels of Bidens administration) so that when the tendies have rolled in from GME you know just where to put them and have the conviction (that must be earned, it cant be copied) to hold and fight off Shitron and others who call this one a casino. Plus it has almost 10 million shares short so it is a good opportunity to stick it to the man.

Obligatory   and may every single one of you retards prevail in the war against Melvin Capital

Title: ***THESE ARE THE SHORTS, BE INFORMED *** "GIVE THEM NOTHING, TAKE FROM THEM EVERYTHING"
SOME DD TO EASE THE WORRY, WE MUST HOLD UNTIL THESE SHORTS ARE SQUASHED. BELOW YOU CAN SEE GME OPTIONS CHAINS FOR DIFFERENT STRIKES AND HOW THEY ARE PUSHING TO GET SHARE PRICE LOW TO WIN.

I LIKE THIS STONK. SO I WILL HOLD

THIS IS THE WAY

Title: THERE ARE ONLY TWO OUTCOMES: WE WIN, OR MAJOR RECESSION.
Listen up guys, because this is either going to make or break the U.S. ECONOMY.

We have these hedge funds BY THE BALLS.

BY THE BALLS.

Think about it for a second. As a strategist like my boy Shikamaru, I like to think about what the other side is thinking. What they're doing. How wet their shits are, or how much fucking Pepto Bismol they're drinking. Allow me to explain.

Hedge funds are currently liquidating all their other assets to cover their asses, but they can't do it all in one go, or else the ENTIRE stock market will tank. They do it veeeeeery slowly, 1-3% decreases, every day. Just so there's no suspicion.

But how long can they keep this up? How are they going to drop the price down of GameStop all the way back to $20 when the entire WORLD (even FUCKING EUROPE AND ASIA NOW) is buying up a majority of the shares? Please, for the love of [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/), understand this.

They are basically mitigating their risk. They're taking their profits from companies that have had huge returns (Tesla, Apple, Amazon) since the pandemic hit. But they're doing it as slow as they can, so nobody is alarmed, and that they don't trigger a massive sell-off.

Let me explain that again to the smooth brains out there. Not only are they fucking US over, they're also fucking OUR PARENTS over. You think us degenerates buy ETFs and mutual funds? FUCK NO, it's the "traditional" investors. The ones that just buy ETFs from wealth management firms, and the ones contributing to their 401k, Roth IRAs, and so on. With that being said, there are only two outcomes: We win, or major recession.

Outcome 1 - We Win:

If we continue to stay strong, keep buying, and use those diamond hands, we can eventually squeeze them out, make massive profits at the expense of the system, followed by a government bailout to these hedge funds with new laws saying that they can NEVER buy naked shorts again.

Outcome 2 - Major Recession:

However, if they continue to mitigate this squeeze to take the least amount of losses, the entire nation's portfolios will be devastated, billions of MORE DOLLARS lost on our side, which will be pocketed by these hedge funds, requiring more stimulus, and devaluing the dollar even further. They are completely fine with destroying the nation's economy AGAIN just because these power-hungry fucks think they have the right to do so.

So, ask yourself honestly: "do these hedge funds care about us?"

FUCK NO!

They don't give a shit about you or your family. Right now, they just care about reducing the price they have to pay for this mess, at the expense of the people. And they're doing so through blatant market manipulation, restrictions of purchase, short ladders, control of the press, and so on.

We're not giving them an INCH. These crooks are so evil, and I am now starting to realize the kind of corrupt world we live in.

Upvote this to spread awareness. THE ENDGAME IS ABOUT TO START.

7$ Calls are 26$.

5$ calls for next week are 43$.

4.50$ calls are 55$.

&amp;#x200B;

Can't buy more than 110 shares, but you can buy 100 contracts for 1/10 of the price of those same shares.

&amp;#x200B;

NOK's announcing earnings on Friday, if they announce that they're reinstating their dividend, this could run.

They'll be announcing their 5G results on Friday.

Shares are currently trading at their long-term average, it's not like they sold off significantly.

&amp;#x200B;

THIS IS NOT A SHORT SQUEEZE.

I repeat: THIS IS NOT A SHORT SQUEEZE.

This is a legitimate company that actually makes money.

It's got a 23 billion dollar valuation, but should be trading at double this.

Shares float is 5 bn shares, but there are a LOT of institutional investors that are buy and hold. The actual float's a lot smaller than that. Most of them will buy more if the company reinstates the div.

Title: AMD DD / Stock Analysis  [Technical, Fundamental &amp; DCF] &amp; $AMD Stock Forecast [Short &amp; Long Term]
**In this post we are going to go through an in-depth analysis of AMD, we are going to take a look at their fundamental value, their DCF, do a little technical analysis and set some price targets for the near future and for the long term**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone! Lets start by talking a little about [AMD](https://ibb.co/d0cPRrj), they are one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, and they operate in multiple segments like Computing, Gaming, Enterprise, Semi-Custom and many more with some of the most important products for the company being microprocessors and GPUs both for personal use like (gaming consoles &amp; PCs) while also offering products for professional use like data centers.

The company was founded more than 50 years ago and have more than 11K employees, with the company overperforming recently as they have seen a more than 80% rise in the last year.

So, guys, lets go a little through the 4th quarter &amp; yearly [results](https://ibb.co/f0CLSF7) for AMD. The company reported a revenue of $3.24B in the 4th quarter, with a 53% growth since last year, while for the full year they earned almost $10B as they more than doubled they quarterly and full year net income, which resulted in a $1.29 earnings/share for the year.

The [company](https://ibb.co/TY6trfs) has 2 major income segments in Computing &amp; Graphics which brought in sales of over $6.4B for the year and an operating income of $1.26B and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment which brought in $3.3B in revenues and almost $400M in operating income. They also provide an additional segment that doesnt bring in any revenues but which represents costs that cant be associated with any of the other 2 segments, but also includes stock-based compensations and acquisitions related costs.

Both of these 2 [segments](https://ibb.co/qdfVyrK) have seen huge increases in the past year with operating income doubling for the computing &amp; graphics segment and increasing by almost 50% for the EEC segment.

[AMD](https://ibb.co/tYmkPwg) didnt have such a big capital expenditure in 2020, with only $294M but this can increase depending on the demand of their products while they also [adjusted](https://ibb.co/hCtfk2k) their income with $312M in depreciation &amp; amortizations. Both of these numbers have increased by 40 to 50% in the past years and will be important in the DCF valuation. 

They have also managed to increase the gross profit margin to 45%, up 2% from 2019 as their earnings before interest &amp; tax or [EBIT](https://ibb.co/xDptyzW) stood at $1.37B.

The company has seen a continued earnings per share [growth](https://ibb.co/FhLj0Y7) overall, despite the first 2 quarters of 2020 coming in lower than previous, but that was to be expected as this was impacted by the reduced [revenues](https://ibb.co/QdjCvnx) in Q1 &amp; Q2 before things started to pick up back again, as they finished with a huge increase overall in the 4th quarter.

Their product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/YkjNDbY) has become a great challenge to Intels market share and is continuing to evolve, as Intel is still struggling to regain momentum with their products.

[AMD](https://ibb.co/XX3h4CD) announced the worlds best processors for laptop and an enterprise variant that is expected to be available in the first half of 2021.

They have also launched the fastest [AMD](https://ibb.co/fQQnFj4) gaming graphics card ever while also [working](https://ibb.co/D9dDDYs) with big companies like Amazon on their AWS cloud offerings &amp; Microsoft Azure which are planning to use their upcoming 3rd generation EPYC processors.

AMD is also involved in supercomputers which indicates that they are continuing to innovate and develop products that will be in high demand for the foreseeable future

The one big thing that can propel AMD even more in the future is the proposed acquisition or more rather merger with [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/N2YQFS9) , which also beat earnings expectations the other day, with revenues of over $800M for the quarter and a Free Cash Flow of 44% of their revenues. [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/QH8RTCN) has a market cap of over $32B, and the combination of the 2 companies would [create](https://ibb.co/qJM6Gn4) synergies. [They](https://ibb.co/PcNhH58) are targeting an all-stock transaction which will have implications on my projections, but as time has gone, the $35B price tag is only a 10% premium for Xilinx. The one hurdle the companies have to pass is the regulatory procedures. We will have to wait and see if the deal goes through or not, as its expected the deal should be finished by the end of the year, with AMD shareholders retaining 74% of the new group shares and Xilinx holding the remaining 26%.

AMD also offered great [guidance](https://ibb.co/n649gFm) for 2021 as they expect the strength of their product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/Xbx5TV4) to push AMD revenues up 37% over 2020 and also expect their gross margin to increase to 47%, while they [expect](https://ibb.co/RpcwXYr) an effective tax rate for next year of 15%, well belove the 21% US corporate tax rate.

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on

So, lets start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/hKFMswn) to see what the current valuation of the company is.

I used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later on in the long-term projection and the net income for 2020 to which I added back the Depreciation &amp; Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to a $1.68B EBITDA. 

For the next years I used 1% increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and an increase in capex of 10%/year in order to maintain an increased production capacity while also applying a 15% decrease in their net working capital.

So, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the Average SP500 return, we get a $9.7B Discounted Free Cash Flow by 2025.

Now there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt, which in this case stands $5.75B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though some of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach and other on the growth approach. 

If we use the growth approach, we can see that AMD is pretty fairly valued right now, as this implies a loss of 2%, while on the other hand the EBITDA multiple approach gives us a valuation of over $112, meaning an almost 30% undervaluation of the company. But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for AMD in 2021 is $98.82, implying a 13.5% return from the last price.

And now lets move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for AMD.

For my [projections](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the EEC segment for 2021 and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth, while for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment I implied a 35% growth, way lower than the over 100% they saw in 2020, also implying a gradual slowdown of the trend by 2025.

I think these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high [demand](https://ibb.co/vQFwyRd) the company has seen for their entire product line, especially as gaming revenues have continued to increase, and also taking into account the need for their products in data centers, cloud usage &amp; digital currency mining.

For their cost of [sales](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr), I started from the current ones which stand at 80% for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment and implied a 1% improvement each year, while for the EEC segment I started from the 88% expense margin right now and implied a gradual 2% improvement. I also maintained their other expense regarding to the cost of sales to 3% of their total revenues, in-line with the previous years.

This means for [2025](https://ibb.co/swQfJgf) we would get just over $33B in revenues and $26B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $7B. I also maintained the same capex as in the DCF and also [substracted](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) the interest &amp; other expenses for which I implied a 5% annual growth, thus leading us to a $6.28B in earnings before tax. 

I [maintained](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) their 15% effective tax rate projections and also diluted their shares by 1% each year accounting for some dilution in the stock.

So, for the $5.3B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 1.27B shares, that would mean a $4.21 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://ibb.co/HYzfCkz) is trading at 20 times forward price to earnings for 2025.

I like to base my future projections on Forward/PE valuations so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $105 and almost $168.   

So, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/SyN8bn9) are my actual price targets 

I think the 2025 bear case price we can see AMD trade at is $115 which would imply a return of almost 33% , while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that AMD will trade at 137$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 57% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $158, which would imply a return of over 81%. So yeah guys, [THIS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 &amp; 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PEs with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40. 

So [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for AMD by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.

I think these are pretty reasonable [targets](https://ibb.co/9NTJYmP), as the semiconductors industry will keep on booming in the next decade, as the world will need more &amp; more chips that also keep advancing in technology. 

The company also has very good [financials](https://ibb.co/NCtxnFq), with almost $9B in assets vs just $3.1B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by just the current assets.

And lets also take a look at what the estimates are from the [analysts](https://ibb.co/G0QpnrW). We can only see EPS estimates until 2023 of $3.22, which I think is safe to say can grow an additional dollar by 2025, so my projections are pretty in-line with what other experts anticipate.

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for AMD?

Lets look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/wQw6CQP), the stock just broke below the long-term uptrend but has seen good support at the $86-87 levels, which is where the next support should stand. We saw AMD pushing towards $100 in the beginning of the year, but it hit major resistance once [Intel](https://ibb.co/pjHdVFQ) also announced a change in their leadership, as they brought in the WMWare CEO Gelsinger, but its very hard to see him turn around Intel in a very short time. Intel will need some years &amp; a lot of capital expenditure to turn things around, if they do manage to do it at all. 

AMD hasnt been overbought since August, and currently has an RSI near 41, which is pretty oversold for a good company, so I expect to see them regaining some momentum in the near-term, but I guess the market is very busy with the current short-squeezes. AMD will se a lot of resistance breaking through the $100 level, not because of something fundamental with the company, but I guess its a psychological resistance rather.

And lets take a quick look at what 24 [analysts](https://ibb.co/bKRQwXP) on Wall Street are saying. They mostly have a buy call on the company with an average price target of $100 and a high price target of $135. So, I think the analyst are pretty spot on with AMD, but my PT are slightly lower as its always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.

So, what would I do? Well, I own AMD stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position right now and add on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops even lower than 80$.

One last thing to mention about AMD is that they also have a very big % of their [shares](https://ibb.co/zZcxm95) held by institutions, with over 74% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard &amp; Blackrock which does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities.

So, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think [Lisa SU](https://ibb.co/X2nVGTF) has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO, and has driven AMD to a renewed approach to their business, as the [company](https://ibb.co/WtBf4yF) has been booming in the past 5 years, growing more than twice as much as Nvidia and crushing the SP500 and Intels performance.

Point69 may be bailing out MC with a massive put play.  That play has played out everyday since a spike on Monday at 10:30 across Point69s holdings. Today a lot of their holdings were smashed from 12:12 until 12:48.

Short selling to get puts into the money, executing the puts to settle the outstanding shares, banking the excess?

Title: test 123
Medicines Agency (EMA) has adopted a positive opinion, recommending that a marketing authorisation be granted to icosapent ethyl in the European Union for the reduction of risk of cardiovascular events in patients at high cardiovascular risk, under the brand name VAZKEPA.  


The CHMP recommendation is now expected to be reviewed by the European Commission, which has the authority to approve medicines for marketing in the European Union. A decision by the European Commission is expected to take place within 67 days of the CHMP opinion.

We thank the EMA for its thoughtful review of our application and concluding it in a timely manner despite the challenges imposed by COVID-19, said Steven Ketchum, senior vice president, president of R&amp;D and chief scientific officer of Amarin. This positive CHMP opinion is a significant milestone for Amarin, taking us one step closer to making this important therapy available to millions of patients in the European Union at high risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes. We are dedicated to supporting a rethinking of cardiovascular disease risk reduction in Europe with further emphasis on preventative care.

The CHMP opinion is based on over a decade of development and testing of icosapent ethyl, including data from the REDUCE-IT cardiovascular outcomes study. REDUCE-IT evaluated more than 8,000 high risk patients who despite having their cholesterol levels well controlled by statin therapy remained at significant risk of heart attack, stroke, or other major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including death. As published, patients in the REDUCE-IT study had a median follow-up period of nearly five years.

Title: $AMC Options volume expiring today
Take a look at this overview of $AMC  Options: 

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC/options/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC/options/)

Every Options marked blue (yes, thats all of them) is **IN THE MONEY**. That means by the end of the day all of these will be exercised. Just taking a look at the total volume and comparing it to say [GME](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME) oder [BB](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/BB/options?p=BB&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch), we know this will be a massive buy force.

Title: Why you should think twice before switching to fidelity or vanguard
So after robinhood and a few other brokers restricted buying on GME, a lot of you have been looking into other brokers. Ive seen many recommend fidelity and vanguard. I am here to STRONGLY caution against this, and I will explain why.

At some point, there will be a squeeze, and we will hold until the price skyrockets. Most of you will be selling with limits well into the thousands for massive profit. But guess who else owns a LOT of GME stock? If you guessed Fidelity and Vanguard, youd be absolutely right, because they own 13.67% and 7.43% respectively.

They are both big ass whales in this game, and whenever the squeeze is squoze, theyre gonna sell whenever they feel like it. Its also best for them that they have more people holding, not selling, that way they can sell as high as they want. They have MASSIVE incentive to lock retail investors out of buying AND selling so that they can name their price to the hedge funds shorting GME.

Maybe Im just being cynical, but I dont want anybody to get screwed on this. Stick with your current broker as long as you can still hold your positions, and if fidelity and vanguard end up not screwing us over, Ill be the first to hand them my money. But Im skeptical to say the least.

I am not a financial advisor, in fact Im *this* close to eating glue off my fingers.

Title: Exercise your ITM calls on GME if you can
Hello my degenerate comrades.  Just a PSA for you all.  

I'd you own ITM calls and can exercise them, you should do so because it will ensure one of two things occur:

1.) The counter party who sold the option contract is forced to buy 100 shares of the stock and relinquish them to you for the strike price.  This is the case if the option was sold naked or part of a spread.

2.). The counter party owned the stock when the wrote the option (covered call) and is forced to hand over the shares to you.  This won't move the stock, but at least it will put the shares in your  .

Due to the insane amount of open interest in GME calls, there are likely more total option obligations in terms of total shares owed to call holders than shares that exist for trade.  If enough outstanding positions were naked or spreads this could have a significant impact on the number of people who have to buy today.

hear me out here,

 RH limits buying to 5 shares, after crashing the price yesterday. This saved hedges billions from options expiration today....

&amp;#x200B;

However (5) shares limit to buy means they still have liquidity issues.... it seems to me that they could potentially kill the options this week, they've limited option buys moving forward to I  believe (10).

Do they finally capitulate, and anyone who has shares is locked in to the rocketship?? I  feel like this is the beginning of them salvaging any losses they can before they release the flood valve..

Title: Volume is low, this selloff isn't real
This isn't financial advice, I'm just a dumbass on the internet who noticed some things  


Take a quick look at GME on yahoo finance or something.  Notice the volume right now vs when it was shooting up like crazy a few days ago.  The volume is NOTHING now compared to then.  Odds are bulls have just run out of money to throw at this stock and the hedge funds are just trading between each other to make the stock price appear lower.

Title: American Airlines has double the potential that GME has
AAL has double the short interest that GME has:

GME: 71mil, AAL: 150mil - from [marketbeat.com](https://marketbeat.com)

AAL short interest is 25% ITS ENTIRE FLOAT. That's double United Airlines (14%) and 5x spirit (5%)

20% is considered extremely high for any stock. 

Not only does AAL have the ability to actual gain its value back considering the pandemic destroyed it, but the short sellers already got squeezed slighty the last 2 days and they're probably really fucking happy we didn't attack them as well. 

I repeat, AAL has DOUBLE the potential of GME.

Title: Robinhood &amp; SIPC Insurance, and why it could matter if RH takes their ball and goes crying home to daddy (again)
I expect this to get lost in the fray, but for the few out there that hear me, thanks for listening.

Robinhood could shut it doors tomorrow and you'd be left with about $500k of your moon tendies, that's it.

[Robinhood is SIPC insured](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/insurance/).  What does this mean?  If Robinhood disappeared tomorrow, the Security Investors Protection Corporation (SIPC) would step in to help clean up the mess.  They would take whatever they could recover of RH's AUM [which is estimated at $20b but not disclosed](https://www.brokerage-review.com/investing-firm/assets-under-management/robinhood-aum.aspx), divide them up against the customers, and round up to $500k.

Don't think this scenario is likely?  Look how they locked down after the 28th.  If HFs are doing everything possible not to pay out, don't be shocked when your broker/their partner in crime does the same.

So what can you do if you're thinking your moon tendies will exceed $500k?

Get an account open at a more...established brokerage that looks less likely to go tits up.  From there, request your new/other brokerage initiate a ACATS transfer.  It costs $75 to RH.  [RH offers instructions here](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/transfer-stocks-out-of-your-robinhood-account/)

The only hiccup is...RH will freeze all other transactions on your account regarding the asset class.  So if we moon and bust before the transfer is complete...you're holding the bag.  However, if RH closes their doors before we can get out, they take the bag and someone else cuts you a check.

Haven't been sleeping much since Saturday, and I'm glad to be holding a stock I love with all you beautiful brilliant strong apes.

Title: 1-29 Market Dynamics, GME Should be $1000+, Systemic Risk Fears. Watch out today!
**TLDR: Today's movements are a combination of panic around systemic failure Monday, with some selling of winners to buy GME and other meme stocks by the broad market.  It's also the VIX/Risk Parity unwind trade happening. My opinions: a) GME would be 4 digits if not for the factors today around calls and shares being hard to buy. So it could be 4 digits Monday, depending upon regulatory actions b) we are risking a real financial crisis here if GME does get to 4 digits, c) the fed &amp; treasury dept are likely to intervene Monday and don't want a bubble but might hit it indirectly, D) there's going to be over-regulation out of this. Positions: Vix calls, SPX puts. I do have some longer term OTM spx/es calls, but net short. I am expecting to flip long after or near close.**

We are seeing today is a bunch of things. It's a little similar to what we saw Tuesday and Wednesday - A lot of selling on fear of systemic failure. What is different though is that on Tues/Wed it was hedge funds covering shorts while dropping their winners. You can see this in the movement of GVIP which is an ETF that mechanically picks hedge fund long favorites. It underperformed market dramatically on those days, then overperformed yesterday. Today it is performing around market. 

You also see winners being dumped by retail to now buy GME - I think that's clear in the chart.

Lastly, there's a risk parity trade and momo trade around VIX going on it's fear, risk parity trade, and retail dumping their favorites to buy GME. Explaining all in detail here:

**Why I think GME would be 1000+ Today Normally**            

It's hard to buy call options. They are the leverage that makes this go up fast, multiplicatively with the narrow effective float now and the short interest. We aren't gamma squeezing as much, but it's still multiplicative in a way other parts of the trade aren't. Today, there's restricted buy, there are dealers selling 5m net shares as calls roll off (probably), and you can't get options most places... And the stock is still up a ton. That to me means without the unwind, and with options, we'd be $1000+ today, maybe $2000. Of course, we all know it's a bubble, and bubbles only sustain as long as net capital to the bubble increases. We surely are near the peak - after which it must unwind. But, we'd be very very high price today if not for the Friday dynamics around no options, low trading, option unwind. That leads me to my next point. 

**Systemic Failure Fears:**

This GME thing is allowing a ton of leverage. Shorts leverage the stock with their 140% short. Longs are leveraged on calls. You put those together, and total GME leverage might be 40 or 50 or 60x at times, and it has further unpredictability around a failure-to-deliver option trade. You put that all together, and there are real fears that this can cause a bankruptcy or at least lack of liquidity for any of Brokers, Market Makers, and also random carnage across institutions that are short (or long on margin). It's impossible to forecast this, and models are breaking. In other words, people are scared, even though the total bubble here is only a about 10 billion dollars of capital really exchanged at the end of the day. But, this could cause contagion at this point - if a good amount of brokers, clearing houses, and/or market makers blew up, which I think is on the table if GME is in the thousands, the entire market gets de-stabilized for a while until it's fixed - trades won't clear, accounts locked, sudden drop in all liquidity, and a lot of loss of trust for a while. This is analogous to pinching an artery or something - the damage hits the basic infrastructure that allow the markets to function if it gets much worse, and there's a recovery period even if the damage isn't fatal. This is why I think the market is selling off so hard today primarily - no one wants to hold risk into a GME $1000+ monday, unless you are long GME.                    

**Hedge Funds:**

Hedge funds had to cover shorts and dump longs to stay properly levered. You saw that with the GVIP dump tues/wed. No longer the case - so hedge funds are either well hedged, or aren't really the ones being forced to cover shorts right now. But they definitely took big damage. 

**Retail GME Trade:**

A lot of retail favorites are selling off more today, like Disney, various favored day trading stocks that aren't current memes, etc. That's adding some vol as people rotate to GME.

**VIX and Risk Parity, Momentum Funds**

Whenever vol of a stock in the S&amp;P 500 goes up, the S&amp;P 500 vix also has to go up too. There's a class of funds called 'risk parity funds' that basically try to adjust their allocation on risk/reward basis, so when vix goes up, they assume the risk of S&amp;P 500 went up, so they allocate less to it.. this sends it down.. increasing vix. There are also momentum funds that see this happening and just chase the trend. That further adds momentum down. People aren't going to calm down significantly until systemic risk is off the table here. 

**My Views on Fed Actions**

This is a financial crisis about to happen in plain view. The fed will take action to stop it, because it's obviously happening. They can do this very easily with lines of credit to brokers and clearing houses and market makers, and can also stop the cycle by keeping call options off on GME potentially, but that's more politically dangerous. In any case, I think the feds will find a solution that takes systemic risk off the table. They acted very fast during COVID. I think good chance they do it Sunday before market, then do it Monday. If they don't, Monday could become ugly. 

I think the Fed will want the GME bubble to die, but they also don't want the political heat for blowing up a trade that's symbolic of political activism for a bunch of people. My sense is their only move is to just squeeze the option market to make it so few calls get created, while also restricting new shorts. If calls are fully restored, this goes very high very fast.  Restricting shorts does make it go higher too as it reliably ends the short interest. 

**How I'm Trading This**

It's possible this gets resolved, or the fed does something now, or people BTFD with all the money, but I think this is a situation that could quickly make a -5% market move or a vix spike to the 40s again (we had 37 just 2 or 3 days ago at the close). I'm currently short the market, and long vix, and expect to switch long on my theory of fed support near or after the close. 

**Overregulation**

The government will not let this crisis go to waste and will absolutely over-regulate. Expect things that make shorting harder, and make it harder to have huge amounts of open interest of calls. This will make our way of life less fun unfortunately, because options will tend to be less accessible, more expensive and less potent.

*Yeah, I'm a bear sometimes. I'm actually up 50% YTD despite my horrid GME shorts. I like taking the plausible bets that win big when they work, and cost less when they don't. IT's the WSB mentality. I have a very small extremely long-term put position on GME, but mostly am just short the market right now.  I plan to go long after the close. I did join AMC gang recently to profit, now not in other meme stocks really.*

Title: Silver, an undervalued inflation hedge with short squeeze potential
# Silver as an inflation hedge

Historically, silver has acted as a stellar investment when the government is printing money or inflation is high. See the below graph to see how silver performed in the inflationary 70s and how it has performed over the last 20 years while the federal reserve has been expanding its balance sheet.

*Processing img o6wx2pxquae61...*

I probably don't have to tell you, but I will for those who aren't up to date on the government finances. The government is printing a shit ton of money. Like, the amount of money printing is insane and unprecedented. The M1 money supply went from $4T to $6.7T in 2020 alone. That's a 40% increase in the amount of money! This has never happened in the history of the United States. See graph below.

*Processing img z5jqpuwyvae61...*

Once the vaccines are distributed, which is happening this year, and everyone can start to consume again, inflation will come roaring back. Commodities have already started blowing up which is a preliminary indicator of inflation. See the price of corn, soybeans, and steel below.

*Processing img h8m4bpk2xae61...*

*Processing img wpait7f5xae61...*

[Steel Prices](https://preview.redd.it/ka3cv7y6xae61.png?width=1450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e58b0e166ac605caffced618cee6968007c3206e)

Although the government has printed lots of money in 2020, it is guaranteed they will continue this trend into 2021. The fed is purchasing $120B every month of treasuries and mortgage backed securities, which is equivalent to printing another $1.4T this year. Also, the democrats control all three branches of government and have released a $1.9T covid bill. This is just the covid bill! Biden also has huge plans for infrastructure as well, meaning we will see another multi-trillion dollar bill this year! Because of the expected inflation from these actions, we've seen 10 year interest rates spike over the last month. An increase in interest rates means that big money is expecting increased inflation in the future and demand a higher interest rate to compensate for that. See 10 year interest rate spike below.

[10Y Treasury Interest Rates](https://preview.redd.it/lnvovoshyae61.png?width=2600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=797faa8d80f41281ba2c2990125f69093eddeca1)

While 10Y interest rates are spiking, the real yield (interest rate - inflation) is falling! See graph below. This means that you are losing more and more money by holding a bond/treasury. There are [$20T of US treasuries](https://www.sifma.org/resources/research/us-marketable-treasury-issuance-outstanding-and-interest-rates/) that are yielding negative interest and the people owning them want to get out! They are losing purchasing power by holding those treasuries!

So where will all the money go from the sold treasuries? Inflation hedges and stocks. What are some popular inflation hedges? Gold and silver. So which horse should we choose? Silver, because it has a much smaller market cap ($1T vs $10T) which means it is more volatile. Just look at what happened in 2020. From March to August, silver rallied 140% vs gold's 40%.

# Silver is historically undervalued

There are a few ways to look at the price of silver today vs the historic price. If we look at a current CPI inflation adjusted graph, we will see that the all time high of silver in 1980 was around $120/oz.

[Current CPI Inflation Adjusted Silver Prices](https://preview.redd.it/u7shqn4r1be61.png?width=1666&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14c47c41a1bd61dbd756662d2c3514ddcfbc935a)

This shows that there is huge upside in the price of silver from where we are now, but that doesn't tell the whole story. After the inflationary 1970s, there were sweeping changes made to the CPI to mask the large amount of inflation that was occurring. You can read more about these [here](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/additional-resources/historical-changes.htm). Shadow Stats, a website devoted to measuring economic indicators with the original methods, has a graph of inflation measured with the old CPI shown below.

If you've wondered why cost of living, houses, and other assets have gone up a ton over the last twenty years, while reported inflation is very low, this is why. If we use the 1980s CPI to calculate the inflation adjusted price of silver, we get a much different story.

This shows that the real all time high of silver is around $700! That's 26x the price of silver today. It's an understatement to say we are a long way from all time highs. What could bring us back to these highs?

# Silver supply and demand

Over the past 5 years, [silver supply has been drying up](https://www.cpmgroup.com/update-new-silver-supply-is-drying-up-faster-than-death-valley/). It is becoming harder and harder to get silver! This is due to declining grades at existing projects, a lack of new discoveries, and very few new mines coming online. Below you can see the change in the annual mine supply and the amount of money being invested in finding new mines.

While silver supply is shrinking, [the demand is exploding](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/04/190417102750.htm#:~:text=Silver%20is%20a%20core%20element,price%20of%20building%20each%20unit.com). Emerging technologies, like solar, exceedingly are in need of silver. We already touched previously on Biden's upcoming infrastructure/green bill, which was one of his largest campaign points. His agenda is to move away from oil and fossil fuels and towards green energies like solar. Many of these green energies use silver, which will [create sustained demand into the future](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/06/05/emerging-technologies-to-drive-silver-demand/?sh=1bc943337bd4)! Not only will there be sustained demand, but many banks are short silver leading to a possible short squeeze in the price.

# Silver has short squeeze potential

Silver has been heavily shorted and manipulated for years. There are multiple cases about JPMorgan and other banks resulting in [over $1B in fines](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html). Also, the paper silver market is over 200 times the physical silver market which means that there is not enough silver to go around if people take delivery! Investors pulled record amounts of silver off the COMEX earlier in 2020 and have started again. There are massive inflows into SLV, around $750M last week and $500M in one day. Look at the chart below to see the massive spike in inflow.

[SLV Inflows](https://preview.redd.it/zixdivmu8be61.png?width=1014&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25d8559d214525be3ef5786e1462922616d2a132)

SLV is an ETF that holds its silver in allocated accounts, which means it is taking the silver off the market and contributing to the paper silver squeeze.

# How to play this

I have 6/30/2021 $25C on SLV but I have heard PSLV is just as good. Both hold physical silver. Miners, like AG, are leveraged silver, but they will not contribute to a squeeze because they are producing silver, not pulling it off the market. My positions are shown below.

[My Positions](https://preview.redd.it/th7kuf2y9be61.png?width=2210&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6475cd494fdb9235b3f626b3a7b71edb407db56)

If this is well received, I will release future updates.

TLDR:

Silver is the perfect inflation hedge, supply is shrinking while demand is spiking, and a short squeeze could occur. Silver to the motherfucking moon.

Title: Let's debunk a few things about Gamestop and Melvin because this is getting ridiculous!
Hi,

I want to preface this by saying that this is not financial advice and this is purely for entertainment and informational purposes only. I have no position on Gamestop stock at the moment and no position on the other very volatile stocks either.

I realize that this is a long post that very few people will read so **if you don't want to read all this, at least read the next paragraph :**

*Gamestop is very risky and most probably much riskier than you can imagine as the stock price can go back to 10 or 20 in just a day or 2. The price does not reflect the fundamentals and if suddendly people realize that they can't sell the stock at a higher price as they hope they could, nothing will justify those high prices and the stock price will collapse very quickly. (See Wirecard chart to see what I'm talking about). A lot of you accept those risks the same way a lot of you accepted the risks of investing in bit###n or any scam related to it : you're ok with it only because it's going up and will cry about it as soon as it's going down. And for the novices here, I don't think you fully grasp how insane this is right now as you have no frame of references : you see stocks skyrocketting and think that this pretty rare and I'm here to tell you that it's never happened since the dot-com bubble and i don't know if you remember but this shit didn't end well (even for good tech companies).*

Another thing : English is not my native language so sometimes I'm going to express myself poorly and I apologize for it.

Now, I want to debunk a few things about Gamestop and Melvin Capital :


# 1. They will have to buy at $10 000 no matter what.

False. If they have the choice between waiting (and paying interest for borrowing the stock) even for years they'll do it as it's much MUCH cheaper than buying back the stock at $10 000 or any price above $400 (that I chose completely arbitrarely). As this is (in some way) unprecedented, they will have more help from banks and other hedge funds to help them keep their positions longer until this whole situation calms itself down to prevent them from selling at a completely absurd price.

# 2. They will go bankrupt as a result of this.

Nope. They got bailed out by some hedge funds and they will get bailed out by others in the future.

To prove my point, I'm going to take the case of Long Term Capital Management (LTCM for short) that was in a similar situation :

- At first, they had a good strategy : they had a bunch of arbitrage that nobody really thought of and they got really great returns (they averaged 40% annually).

- Then, other hedge funds copied their strategy and the opportunities got smaller and smaller, so LTCM decided to put riskier and riskier bets. Those bets were very big positions on very illiquid markets therefore if the trade were going badly, they were losing a lot of money and to add insult to injury, since it's in illiquid markets, they would have a very hard time to get out of their positions.

- One day, a bunch of those highly leveraged positions were going down big time and LTCM could not handle it. They sold a bunch of them at highly unfavorable prices but they couldn't liquidate their positions completely.

- Then, banks, hedge funds and the fucking federal reserve decided to bail them out to prevent a major financial crisis. They gave them billions of dollars, split their positions and therefore the losses as well.

- The hedge fund did not go bankrupt and it stayed alive for a while but then they stopped completely as their creditors got paid back.

If I'm telling you that long ass story, it's because it's really similar to what's happening with Melvin Capital : 

- They had a good strategy at first : shorting companies that are slowly going out of business.
- Then got into riskier and riskier plays : added more into their plays in hope to manipulate the price forcing the companies that they shorted to go bankrupt.
- One play went badly.
- Now they're being bailed out by a few banks and this is going to happen even more until this situation stops.

Now there are a 2 differences here :

- First, the positions that LTCM had had no chance of recovering and the price was going to be like that if not lower for a long time. In the case of Melvin, the price of GME will not stay at $10 000 and probably not even $500 for very long.
- And second, this is a much smaller position compared to what LTCM had back then. They had $4.6 billions of dollars in losses on highly leveraged plays, Melvin Capital doesn't have that much even with a $1000 stock price.

So what will happen in my opinion?

Melvin Capital will keep their positions as long as they have to. If the price doesn't go down, the government will probably force some stock holders or the company itself to sell the stock at a reasonable price to help them out.

# 3. This is like the 2008 crisis.

Like wtf??! 

This is nowhere near like the 08 crisis. Like what are you smoking??!

The CDS (the products that they bought back then) were literally worthless and could NEVER recover. A lot of people defaulted their loan and therefore those loans could NEVER recover. The banks were leveraged 30x meaning that for every million dollars worth of defaulted loans, their losses were at 30 million dollars.

Also, the sums for the 08 crisis was much MUCH bigger than the 10 billion dollars that the company is worth right now.

Also, in the case of the 08 crisis, a lot of those products got exchanged around the world and made it a worldwide crisis.

Finally, if you think this is like that, then remember that the government bailed them out with the taxpayer's money and a lot of banks and hedge funds actually MADE MONEY from this crisis. And some banks sold those worthless products to some of their clients that lost all of their 401K.

# 4. They will have to buy it back from us.

False, I've already debunked this : they will probably ask the company to sell it at a "fair" price whatever that means.

But to expand on that, I want to talk about the greater fool theory as this is probably the best example of this right now.

From Investopedia :

&gt;The greater fool theory states that it is possible to make money by buying securities, whether or not they are overvalued, by selling them for a profit at a later date. This is because there will always be someone (i.e. a bigger or greater fool) who is willing to pay a higher price.

This is obviously happening right now as some of you bought the stock at $11 and sold at $20, some bought it at this price and sold it at $100 and so on.. and some of you bought it early and kept it this whole time hoping to sell it at a much higher price. 

This strategy only works if you're able to sell your security at the "greater fool" or in other terms, someone that is willing to pay it at a higher price.

Right now it works because everybody is hoping that the hedge funds (and mostly Melvin) will be the greater fools but they have much MUCH more ressources to go through before buying it at these ridiculous prices : manipulating the market to scare the retailers, halting the trading for the stock, preventing the retailers from buying the stock, getting bailed out by other banks, the government or the federal reserve. So i can GUARANTEE you that they will not be buying at those prices.

# 5. Shorting is criminal and should be illegal.

That's going to be short (no pun intended) : No. Shorting is a good strategy when you have a shitty company that will probably go out of business. Tell that to the ones that shorted Enron, Wirecard, or bought all those CDS (essentially shorting the housing market).

What should be prevented is abusing your shorting position to put pressure on a company and forcing them to bankruptcy as they were doing to Gamestop. 

If you shorted Blockbuster, Hertz, Kodak, and many others, it wasn't criminal, it was profiting off of a dying business. If you think this is horrible to do : this is debatable but also you're basically doing the same thing by trying to squeeze them out of their positions.

# 6. The class action lawsuit will result in Robinhood going out of business.
Robinhood will say that they halted buying the stock to protect their clients as this is a very volatile stock and they were not professionals. Also, they were issues with the clearing of the trades making it impossible for them to execute all those trades without impacting the trading of the rest of the securities.

Also, in the Customer Agreement, section 5-J :
&gt; I understand that Robinhood may discontinue My Account and any services related to My Account
immediately by providing written notice to Me.

Also, they could just lie and make bullshit claims and will get away with this because their clearing house is fucking Citadel and Citadel is pretty fucking powerful in the financial system.

# 6-bis : People leaving Robinhood will result in Robinood going out of business.
Most people will not leave Robinhood. 

There were countless examples of pretty fucked up things that they've done and people still use it to this day. Quote from a comment that I've made a few days ago :

&gt; After GUH moment, countless outages during very volatile moments, them using fucking Citadel (you know, the ones that gave money to Melvin to let them live a bit longer) to clear your trades, them not giving you the correct bid/ask data, the app being full of bugs, and them having a better mobile app than website, and [people] still use it??!

If after all this and way more, people still use it, people will still use it even after that because it's fun to play around in their app and now those retail traders are used to the app.

# 7. This is unprecedented, so nobody can really predict what will happen.
False, a lot of those things happened before, so this situation is not precedented but the MAGNITUDE of the situation is. You could definitely predict them preventing people from buying as they're scummy af, you could predict banks to bail them out (and even more in a few days) as this has happened before with LTCM. You can predict that they will not suffer the consequences because in all scandals they never fucking do as they're so important to our system and them going out of business will collapse the whole financial system. 

So here are the things that can happen :

- Gamestop is forced to sell their stock at a "fair" price. If they refuse, the government will threaten them with legal consequences like market manipulation or some bullshit like that (don't need to be right, just need to scare them with big consequences).
- Hedge funds will give their positions to banks and banks will sell them to customers (just like in the 08 crisis).
- They will be bailed out to prevent a big financial meltdown. Then, as people will realize that they will never close their position at the high price that they hoped they would, they suddendly sell their shares and the price of the stock will collapse. The hedge funds buy back the stock at a low price. They make money in the process and a lot of retails lose their life savings.

In fine, my point is that if you want to hurt them, you're hurting them a lot right now with your newfound power. But don't think for a second that this will result in them going bankrupt or any big consequences for them. This will result, as always, with them making a lot of money (or at the very least recouping their losses) and the retail investors losing all their money.

Thanks for going to my ted talk.

Title: The GME shorts' endgame. INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.
 *READ*

Credit to [u/Pcbuildingnoob699](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pcbuildingnoob699/) \-- I'm rephrasing so it's just pure information/education and not financial advice.  
THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, THIS IS PURELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.

When might you want to sell? A quick guide for GME noobs.  
TL;DR: DIAMOND HAND  

&amp;#x200B;

Too much disinformation about when to sell. We are seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (WHICH IS ALMOST CERTAINLY NOT IN YOUR FINANCIAL INTEREST) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how some smart investors will play the ending. \[Note: I u/TheKageyOne, will not be selling at all, at least not for a long time. I'm in this to hurt the shorts, send a message, and watch GME grow and restructure into a totally new e-commerce and brick and mortar business in the coming years).

First, we need to understand what is "Days to Cover" or "Short Ratio" .

Official definition:

 Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted.  Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question.  A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

* imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.
* Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called "Days to Cover"

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to **START** covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's **NOT** gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If people hold GME stocks play it right and hold while shorts cover, they can literally squeeze this to infinity as the shorts try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND DO WITH THIS INFORMATION WHAT YOU WILL. A LOT OF YOU ARE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

*NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE*

Title: WE HOLD TILL THEY'RE BANKRUPT - Supposedly Current SI on GME/AMC - 
Ok, so I'll preface it like this. I like the stock.

But really, hold GME.
I'm hugely skeptical of all the information being put out. Shitron is "will no longer publish short reports". Doesn't mean they won't stop shorting, just like every other Wall Street guy. Cramer saying sell. **IT'S ALL BULLSHIT**

Now onto Short Interests.
Hold your GME shares, it'll hurt all the way up for these fucks. Why you say? 

Based on supposed data from S3 (I will continue to refer to everything as supposed, because it's getting insane to discern credible news anymore).


Link: [(Cool pictures on twitter)](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194252674953219?s=20)

short interest is $11.20B; 57.83M shares shorted; 113.31% of Float; 53.12% S3 SI% Flt; 29% fee &amp; easing. Shares shorted down -5.08M shares, worth $983 million, -8.07%, last week. Shorts down -$19.75B in 2021 mark-to-market losses; down -$7.83B on today's +70% move.


**That's almost $8 Billion dollars boys and girls. If that continues, and shorts stay in (this is also approximate math), that means at $1k per GME it'll be at least $32B more compounded onto their loss porn.** (BETTER FUCKING SHOW THAT SHIT, I GET OFF TO IT)



Now onto AMC (same data sources)

[(Cool pictures on twitter)](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194013461204994?s=20)

short interest is $384M; 44.47M shares shorted; 15.75% of Float; 13.61% S3 SI% Flt; 11.32% fee. Shares shorted down -906K shares, worth $8 million, -2.00%, last week. Shorts down -$523M in 2021 mark-to-market losses; down -$211M on today's +55% move.


Only $211M on a 55% move... That means to reach gamestop levels of loss porn, the stock would have to practically need to hit 2000% gains at the moment (math here: $8b losses on gme divided by $211M losses on amc, multiply all this by 55% and you get 2000%, math is probably wrong but I'm autistic.)


That's why I see  for GME. Continue holding AMC, but I'm on the DFV train. I SELL WHEN HE SELLS.


TL:DR: I see GME as a bigger adventure (and war). Hold till hedge funds have to declare bankruptcy. All this current news is fluff to convince you to sell your tendies and make them money. They're still shorting because they think we're  bitches. BUT we're .


etc for certain people watching: Only invest what you're willing to lose. I'm too dumb to be a professional trader. I like the stock.

Title: Why the Short Squeeze cannot go on forever
I have seen posts about short-sellers; why do they need to close their position?  Can't they hold out until the price goes down?  They can indeed do that, but they have to pay to borrow those shares, and I got curious, what ARE they paying to not close?

So I looked it up and thought I would share. I found this short FAQ on selling short shares providing rough calculations based on the current price of GME,

[https://ibkr.info/article/1146](https://ibkr.info/article/1146)

I found a rate of 32\~% on GME short Borrow Fee Rate, and I am lazy and assuming 60 million shares of being shorted every day.

60,000,000 shares X $300/share = $18 billion dollars are being borrowed for shorting.

$18 Billion \* 32% / 360 days in year = $16 million dollars a day (trading day or not)

Roughly, they are losing $300 million a month! Also, the money that they have tied to margin on the short cannot be used elsewhere.  If they could have been making 5% somewhere else, they are effectively paying 37% to short GME stock.

So you say, "when will the squeeze happen?"  The better question is WHY the squeeze will happen.  At some point, these hedge funds are going to need that money for something else.  They are losing 300 million a month.  That is assuming the price does not go up.  If it goes up any more, they are losing more on interest (the amount they pay in interest is calculated daily).

The other problem for them is what happens when they cannot borrow shares anymore.  If I decide, I want to sell, and the brokerage has to get the stock back from the short-seller.  The short-seller has to go to the market and buy for whatever price is available. 

In a way, as a stock owner, YOU CAN SET YOUR OWN PRICE.  If the liquidity in the market disappears, you can set your price to be $1000, AND THEY HAVE TO PAY IT TO GIVE YOUR STOCK BACK.

Holding the stock, you are squeezing hedge funds and market makers for as long as there is no liquidity for GME stock.

Title: Stuck in RH Currently?
A retard's observations (note: I'm not a licensed autist; I've only paid for a Tesla roof with TSLA over the past year)

So you fucked up, didn't listen (like myself) to other retards screeching about other brokers, and are stuck with whatever GME, AMC, BB, NOK, NAKD, etc... you had before the shenanigans started. Now you don't know what to do with your spare change. 

Put that spare change into $TSLA. Shares are discounted at $805 (currently and dropping), and picked up another $1000 price rating recently. I give it two weeks until that happens. Why?

I've seen your comments. Retards have been selling TSLA to YOLO GME and AMC. When the Tendieman cometh to distribute his golden tendies, you magnificent TSLA faithful will pick up where you left off, while TSLA shoots its load back up to $1000. I give it two weeks to a month. Before those  turn back to TSLA .

TL:DR- TSLA  to $1000 by 2/26. This is not sound investment advice.

Title: No, Robinhood, Webull, and other brokers who limited buying yesterday are not colluding. This is the real reason behind brokers restricting buying $GME, $AMC, etc.
I know this is an unpopular opinion because the optics make it appear that the brokers all out to protect the shorts and stick the bill on the little guys, classic David vs Goliath. So what actually is happening?

TLDR; The DTC raised collateral limits to settle certain stock transactions from 1-3% to 100% for the 2 days held in escrow, which trickled down to clearing houses which dont have the capital to clear the current trading volume at 100% collateral, so clearing houses restricted buying of those stocks to prevent themselves going under. Clearing houses are securing loans to bridge the gap and once additional capital is secured, will re-admit buying of those restricted stocks, including our beloved $GME.

       

What is the DTC?

The Depository Trust Company is the bees knees. Back in the day when you bought a stock, you were given a piece of paper, like a $10 bill in your wallet, to certify that you have cleared payment of the stock and are now the rightful owner. This was all fine and dandy in the olden days when there far were fewer traders and even fewer companies to trade, but pesky humans just love to continue to invent new things, especially computers.

Can you imagine trying to trade stocks today still backed by pieces of paper? It just isnt feasible. So in the early 1970s a digital solution was devised; enter the DTC.

The DTC is the record keeper of who owns what, and they certify &gt;95% of all trades on the market. They are the ones who certify that /u/DeepFuckingValue (aka the God of WSB) actually owns the 50,000 shares he paid for a year ago and ensured whomever sold him those 50,000 shares got paid for them.

Watch the video: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dtc.asp

DTC guarantees that if you sell a share, you will be paid for selling that share. Very important fundamental service provided.

       

The two sides of the trade.

Whenever a trade happens there are two sides; the customer side and the street side (yes, the Wall Street). Brokers (Robinhood, e-trade, etc.) represent the customer side of the trade and the market makers represent the street side. When you place an order to buy a share from your broker, they in turn go to their Market Maker(s) to make the trade. The MM, after verifying things appears kosher, then sends the order to their clearing firm to begin settling the trade. In order to settle the trade with the DTC, the clearing firm is required to pay the DTC somewhere between 1%-3% of the notional value of the trade to be held as collateral in escrow for \~2 business days until the trade is settled. The clearing firm submits the trade to the DTC who certifies the trade and facilitates the final transaction and release of funds.

1. /u/DeepFuckingValue buys 50,000 shares @ $5/share ($250,000)
2. Robinhood places order with their MM, Citadel (they bailed out Melvin with $2,750,000,000) who then communicates this order with the stock exchange the security is listed on
3. Citadel sends order to Apex (clearing house for Robinhood, Webull, Tastyworks, SoFi, Ally, and most of the newer app-based trading startups)
4. Apex sends trade to the DTC along with 2% collateral ($50,000)
5. Two days later the DTC says the trade is good and settles the transaction
6. The seller is paid $250,000 and /u/DeepFuckingValue is given his 50,000 shares. Brokers basically front the cash to make it all official during the 2 day settling period and your transaction shows in your account already even though it technically hasnt yet settled.

       

So what happened on Thursday when buying became restricted?

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Es2YXQNVEAAepgT.png

The DTC, and consequently some clearing houses, for certain stocks raised their collateral requirements from \~2% to 100%. You read that right. If the collateral to buy 50,000 shares @ $5/share ($250k) was 2% ($50k), it was now raised to $250k. That means for every single buy order (from Robinhood, Webull, etc.) running through their clearing house was required to front 100% of the notional value to their clearing house, Apex, and have it sit there in escrow for 2 business days. 

Well look at the trade volume on $GME, it was averaging \~70M/day this past week before Apexs buying restriction. If we assume half that daily volume was buy orders, 35,000,000 trades \* x shares per trade \* $$$/share = billions. Clearing houses simply are not equipped to front these levels of cash at 100% collateral, so buying was forcibly restricted.

Its important to note that there is no collateral required on the other side of the deal, to sell a share, collateral is only required on the buy side. This is why you could still sell your share but not buy additional shares.

Another note about the clearing firms is, once trades that happened two days ago settle, the funds used for collateral become available to them again and if their risk models allow it, can re-open accepting new buy orders.

Brokers using different clearing houses, or brokers that can self-clear their trades, were generally still capable of handling these new requirements. A presumption could be made that if they are already large enough to be able to self-clear trades then they probably have access to more capital to meet collateral requirements and arent forced to deny new buy orders.

I highly encourage each and every one of you to watch this interview with Webulls CEO who explains exactly how they and brokers using Apex as their clearing house were forced to restrict buy orders due to increased collateral requirements: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RS4JIEVyXM

       

Now lets look at this from the other side of the trade.

Melvin Capital shorted millions of shares of $GME. Their broker facilitated this action, which in-turn was transacted by their market maker(s), ran through their clearing house(s) and settled by the DTC. What happens when Melvin is bled dry?

Melvin loses everything, and its still not enough to cover their debt. The clearing house is next on the chopping block and steps in to provide the funds that Melvin can no longer provide. They write it off as a loss and will be amongst the first in line of creditors seeking payment during Melvins solvency process to try and recoup whatever possible. But what happens if they cant cover the cost of all of those shares?

And thats where were at today. Clearing houses are seeking short-term bridge loans from major institutional banks to secure enough $$$ to settle everybodys trades. They are teetering on the edge and are shoring up their accounts for the pending tidal wave that is our beloved short squeeze. If they run out of money, the market could cease to function properly and were looking at a near system-wide collapse.

Bleeding Melvin dry means bleeding Melvin, their market maker(s), AND their clearing house(s). The MMs &amp; the clearing house(s) are collateral damage and should not be the target of our focus. But dont worry, theyre all insured anyways, but they still need funds now to continue to function nominally.

So at the end of the day, Citadel didnt exactly go to each broker and tell them hey, stop letting people buy shares so we can exit out of our positions. But they are using their MM advantage to continue their ladder attacks to drive the price down. As a MM they are allowed to increase liquidity by creating new shorted shares, but they must be repaid by market close. 

So are they playing dirty? Of course they are, and we expected them to. If you managed billions of dollars, wouldnt you do everything in your power to prevent losing it? Sure, they didnt heed warnings from their risk assessment department who probably told them to turn tail and cut their losses, doubled-down, and committed to giving us all our long-awaited tendies.

       

Keep up the good fight, , the squeeze has not squoze.

Positions: hundreds of shares starting from $20 and averaging up and a few call options expiring today

Title: $VMNT Vemanti Group (OTC) Going $10++ Currently Only .77 Cents (Pre-SPAQ)
 Vemanti Group has been on an upward trend for the past 6 months and its ready to break out in a big way. Soon they will be listing it on the Nasdaq via a SPAQ. The company is focused on AI, Stablecoin tech and has some assets in gold miners. The market cap is estimated to be about 60 million right now and can easily get to over 1 billion once listed on the Nasdaq. Also, it is believed that Citadel is the main player on the short side of this stock (they are the OTC dealer) and is said that they have about 50% of the float short.

TLDR: I would be loading up for a longer term play, especially one its listed on the Nasdaq. Vemanti has many assets that are promising especially the ones such as AI, stablecoins, etc.

Title: 3 Important GME messages everyone should be aware of
3 Important GME messages everyone should be aware of

-Even though buying seems to be back, it can change again in any moment and your orders may not fill. When the dip comes again, AND IT WILL, DO NOT SELL. You may think you can sell all your positions and buy back in on the cheap, BUT THERES NO GUARANTEE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO BUY BACK IN. JUST HOLD AND WE WIN. DONT BELIEVE ANY SHORT FLOAT LIES TODAY.

-Our buying preassure is low today thanks to rh cucking us, and mainly because most of us are already holding. At this point its a game of waiting them out and NOT pussying out in their attacks.

-Even though melvin fucked up with this whole situation, these guys are NOT stupid. They have harvard mathmaticians and proffesional risk analysts. They probably figured out that their losses will be marginally LESS for holding their positions open and paying the borrowing fees than it would be if they covered now. They want to wear us down over time by blocking us from buying, sniping stop losses with ladders and constant media attacks like that sellout Cramer saying the squeeze is over. ALL we have to do is hold, and we will win.

-Non of this is financial advice.

Title: Institutional Ownership of GME is well over 100%. How do shorts cover?
Per https://fintel.io/so/us/gme, it seems that the institutional ownership of GME is at ~160%. 

The largest shareholders are

1	FMR LLC	17.63

2	BlackRock Inc.	13.20

3	RC Ventures LLC	12.90

4	DIMENSIONAL FUND ADVISORS LP	10.81

5	VANGUARD GROUP INC	8.37

6	STATE STREET CORP	5.84

7	Senvest Management, LLC	5.54

8	FOSS DONALD A	5.30

9	Hestia Capital Partners Lp	5.08

10	UBS ASSET MANAGEMENT AMERICAS INC	4.80

11	Permit Capital, LLC	4.79

12	Scion Asset Management, LLC	4.30

13	ROYCE &amp; ASSOCIATES LP	2.29

Total institutional ownership in just the top 13 companies: 100.85%

This isn't counting the board of directors either. So unless a *lot* of institutional people sell, the shorts *cannot* cover. Add that to the *millions* of shares in call options expiring ITM today, there are going to be millions of shares bought and *delivered* on Monday/Tuesday. Not sold on those days, delivered. That is just buying pressure.

Additionally, according to S3 Partners LLC, Open Short interest as of this morning is still 58MM shares. https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194252674953219?s=20

TL;DR: There are more institutional shares than total shares while Short interest is 113% of float.

Title: Will Robinhood be acquired or go public? You decide!
So, Robinhood CEO Vlad the Idiot basically admitted on CNBC yesterday that RH is insolvent. Vlad's comments on CNBC and the emails RH sent out suggest that they had to lock down trades in GME, AMC, etc. because his company doesn't have the cash reserves to guarantee the trades, even after they got an emergency billion-dollar high-interest loan a few days ago. Plus, Vlad has been vocal about wanting to IPO soon. Conclusion: RH needs a cash raise desperately.

After the trade-limiting fiasco, an IPO is off the table for RH for now. If RH's financial situation is as dire as it seems, there's not much left other than a merger. They could SPAC in (wouldn't that be ironic?), but I think it's more likely (because it would generate more cash) that they get acquired by one of the biggies. Which one? Discuss.

(My bet would be on JPM -- they're big in retail banking with Chase Banks, but they don't have much foothold in retail brokerage. They have a HUGE customer base that they could point at RH, so acquisition costs would be low. They've got big leverage and big pockets.)

Title: Another 10k altruistic autist GME purchase.
For altruistic reasons and in the interest of activism I have added another 10k to my position. I am holding to the moon or to zero. I have no hopes or expectations of profit. In fact I am happy to hold till complete loss. 

I am a retard. And yes yes yes I can remain a retard longer than these hedge funds can remain solvent. I have been on wsb since before it had a million subs and never took part but this is a great cause to be on the front line for.

Title: BB BEST LONG TERM PLAY
Stick with bb. If you autists want to keep growing your tendies after this is all over you need to put some capital into bb as well.  Gme is great short term but it will not be going up until 2023 unlike bb. bb has real value behind it and will continue to rise with the EV rise and amzn. It will go 10x minimum by 2023. On top of that it has just as much short interest as amc making it a clear better choice for short term as well. This means extra . On top of that bb had the biggest dip = biggest recovery. A true  play 
BB TO THE MOON  

Title: The Lie the Government is trying to fabricate to protect Boomer Money.
 

So, we saw it in prior weeks--the gaslighting from the media--urging public opinion to support limiting the ability for retail investors to trade freely--in their own interest, "because they'll only hurt themselves."

Well--we can't keep the lie up. The short squeeze is coming! But what are the consequences going to be of a short squeeze? Firms, falling, like dominos. A market crash\~\~In my previous thread, I talked about how Market Makers and Hedge Funds are going to want to withdraw their money before boomers do--so their plan was to watch inflows of boomers cashing out their 401k's to get a head start on everyone.

The lie can not be sustained! But they will try--so right now, the SEC, market makers, etc, are colluding with the government--this is likely why we've seen limitations on most brokers.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7trd5/pernicious\_investment\_corporations\_and\_boomer/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7trd5/pernicious_investment_corporations_and_boomer/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) (I've since learned what "days to cover" means.)

When the news says "Biden's administration is closely monitoring the situation"--what this likely means is that the government is buying into the lie that we need to be regulated--so they gave brokers colluding with market makers that front run every transaction you make the green light to cut us off!

So, what's their next move? They're going to convince us that the SEC should ensure that market prices reflect fundamentals. [https://twitter.com/Fxhedgers/status/1355189622263803904?s=20](https://twitter.com/Fxhedgers/status/1355189622263803904?s=20)

They're going to gaslight us into thinking that we deserve a government bailout--like the banks! "Oh, but the people are always talking about getting bailed out! Well, we're bailing you out!"

What does that mean, though? It means they're going to sell your shares during the short squeeze. Make some kind of settlement, "Everyone who had GME shares is rewarded with $10,000."

Well, we want the full squeeze. We want to see these firms realize the consequences of their actions.

Why are they doing this?

Well, honestly--they're trying to preserve their power and the status quo--but the angle they're going for is that they're trying to protect boomer money. "We can't let the stock market crash--this is boomer retirement money."--get the boomers on board. "Those damn kids! Ruining everything!"

Settle for nothing less than the truth. This is the revolution.

Citadel will pay, for everything. The Citadel will be razed.

I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low (average \~$67--I have to admit, the drop today was too tasty so my cost basis went up from yesterday)/share with my later buys averaged in), and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours. In this post I will go a little further and speculate more than I'd normally do in a post due to the questions I've been getting, so fair warning, some of it might be very wrong.

Thank you everyone for the comments and questions on the [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l5l413/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity/) and [second](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l6xc8l/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_2/) post on this topic.

Today was a study in the power of fear, courage, and the levers you can pull when you wield billions of dollars...

Woops, excuse me. I'm sorry hedge fund guys... I meant trillions of dollars--I just briefly forget you control not just your own but a lot of other peoples' money too for a moment there.

Also, for people still trading this on market-based rationale (as I am), it was a good day to measure the conviction behind your thesis. I like to think I have conviction, but in case you are somehow not yet familiar with the legend of DFV, you need to see these posts (fair warning, nsfw, and some may be offended/triggered by the crude language). The last two posts might be impressive, but you should follow it in chronological order and pay attention to the evolution of sentiment in the comments to experience [true enlightenment](https://www.reddit.com/user/DeepFuckingValue/posts/).

Anyway, I apologize, but this post will be very long--there's just a lot to unpack.

Pre-Market

Disclaimer: given yesterday's pre-market action I didn't even pay attention to the screen until near retail pre-market. I'm less confident in my ability to read what's going on in a historical chart vs the feel I get watching live, but I'll try.

Early in the pre-market it looks to me like some momentum traders are taking profit, discounting the probability that the short-side will give them a deep discount later, which you can reasonably assume given the strategy they ran yesterday. If they're right they can sell some small volume into the pre-market top, wait for the hedge funds try to run the price back down, and then lever up the gains even higher buying the dip. Buy-side here look to me like people FOMOing and YOLOing in at any price to grab their slice of gainz, or what looks to be market history in the making. No way are short-side hedge funds trying to cover anything at these prices.

[Mark Cuban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhZZnVs-KM4)\--well said! Free markets baby!

Mohamed El-Erian is money in the bank as always. "upgrade in quality" on the pandemic drop was the best, clearest actionable call while most were at peak panic, and boy did it print. Your identifying the bubble as the excessive short (vs blaming retail activity) is [money yet again](https://youtu.be/Gxan42tXhbo?t=164). Also, The PAIN TRADE (sorry, later interview segment I only have on DVR, couldn't find on youtube--maybe someone else can)!

The short attack starts, but I'm hoping no one was panicking this time--we've seen it before. Looks like the momentum guys are minting money buying the double dip into market open.

CNBC, please get a good market technician to explain the market action. Buy-side dominance, sell-side share availability evaporating into nothing (look at day-by-day volume last few days), this thing is now at runaway supercritical mass. There is no changing the trajectory unless you can change the very fabric of the market and the rules behind it (woops, I guess I should have knocked on wood there).

If you know the mechanics, what's happening in the market with GME is not mysterious AT ALL. I feel like you guys are trying to scare retail out early "for their own good" (with all sincerity, to your credit) rather than explain what's happening. Possibly you also fear that explaining it would equate to enabling/encouraging people to keep trying to do it inappropriately (possibly fair point, but at least come out and say that if that's the case). Outside the market, however...wow.

You Thought Yesterday Was Fear? THIS is Fear!

Ok short-side people, my hat is off to you. Just when I thought shouting fire in a locked theater was fear mongering poetry in motion, you went and took it to 11. What's even better? Yelling fire in a theater with only one exit. That way people can cause the financial equivalent of stampede casualties. Absolutely brilliant.

Robin Hood disables buying of GME, AMC, and a few of the other WSB favorites. Other brokerages do the same. Even for people on 0% margin. Man, and here I thought I had seen it all yesterday.

*Side note: I will give a shout out to TD Ameritrade. You guys got erroneously lumped together with RH during an early CNBC segment, but you telegraphed the volatility risk management changes and gradually ramped up margin requirements over the past week. No one on your platform should have been surprised if they were paying attention. And you didn't stop anyone from trading their own money at any point in time. My account balance thanks you. I heard others may have had problems, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt given the DDOS attacks that were flyiing around*

Robin Hood. Seriously WTF. I'm sure it was TOTALLY coincidence that your big announcements happen almost precisely when what has to be one of the best and most aggressive short ladder attacks of all time starts painting the tape, what looked like a DDOS attack on Reddit's CDN infrastructure (pretty certain it was the CDN because other stuff got taken out at the same time too), and a flood of bots hit social media (ok, short-side, this last one is getting old).

Taking out a large-scale cloud CDN is real big boy stuff though, so I wouldn't entirely rule out nation state type action--those guys are good at sniffing out opportunities to foment social unrest.

Anyway, at this point, as the market dives, I have to admit I was worried for a moment. Not that somehow the short-side would win (hah! the long-side whales in the pond know what's up), but that a lot of retail would get hurt in the action. That concern subsided quite a bit on the third halt on that slide. But first...

**A side lesson on market orders**

Someone printed bonus bank big time (and someone lost--I feel your pain, whoever you are).

During the face-ripping volatility my play money account briefly ascended to rarified heights of 7 figures. It took me a second to realize it, then another second to process it. Then, as soon as it clicked, that one, glorious moment in time was gone.

What happened?

During the insane chop of the short ladder attack, someone decided to sweep the 29 Jan 21 115 Call contracts, but they couldn't get a grip on the price, which was going coast to coast as IV blew up and the price was being slammed around. So whoever was trying to buy said "F it, MARKET ORDER" (i.e. buy up to $X,XXX,XXX worth of contracts at any price). This is referred to as a sweep if funded to buy all/most of the contracts on offer (HFT shops snipe every contract at each specific price with a shotgun of limit orders, which is far safer, but something only near-market compute resources can do really well). For retail, or old-tech pros, if you want all the contracts quickly, you drop a market order loaded with big bucks and see what you get... BUT, some clever shark had contracts available for the reasonable sum of... $4,400, or something around that. I was too stunned to grab a screencap. The buy market order swept the book clean and ran right into that glorious, nigh-obscene backstop limit. So someone got nearly $440,000 PER CONTRACT that was, at the time theoretically priced at around $15,000. $425,000 loss... PER CONTRACT. Maybe I'm not giving the buyer enough credit.. you can get sniped like that even if you try to do a safety check of the order book first, but, especially in low liquidity environments, if a HFT can peak into your order flow (or maybe just observes a high volume of sweeps occurring), they can end up front running your sweep, pick off the reasonable contracts, and slam a ridiculous limit sell order into place before your order makes it to the exchange. Either way, I hope that sweep wasn't loaded for bear into the millions. If so... OUCH. Someone got cleaned out.

So, the lesson here folks... in a super high volatility, low-liquidity market, a market order will just run up the ladder into the first sell order it can find, and some very brutal people will put limit sells like that out there just in case they hit the jackpot. And someone did. If you're on the winning side, great. It can basically bankrupt you if you're on the losing side. My recommendation: Just don't try it. I wouldn't be surprised if really shady shenanigans were involved in this, but no way to know (normally that's crazy-type talk, but after today....peeking at order flow and sniping sweeps is one of the fastest, most financially devastating ways to bleed big long-side players, just sayin').

Back to the market action..

A Ray of Light Through the Darkness

So I was worried watching the crazy downward movement for two different reasons.

On the one hand, I was worried the momentum pros would get the best discounts on the dip (I'll admit, I FOMO'd in too early, unnecessarily raising my cost basis).

On the other hand, I was worried for the retail people on Robin Hood who might be bailing out into incredibly steep losses because they had only two options: Watch the slide, or bail. All while dealing with what looked to me like a broad-based cloud CDN outage as they tried to get info from WSB HQ, and wondering if the insta-flood of bot messages were actually real people this time, and that everyone else was bailing on them to leave them holding the bag.

But I saw the retail flag flying high on the 3rd market halt (IIRC), and I knew most would be ok. What did I see, you ask? Why, the glorious $211.00 / **$5,000** bid/ask spread. WSB Reddit is down? Those crazy mofos give you the finger right on the ticker tape. I've been asked many times in the last few hours about why I was so sure shorts weren't covering on the down move. THIS is how I knew. For sure. It's in the market data itself.

I'll admit, I tried to one-up those bros with a 4206.90 limit sell order, but it never made it through. I'm impressed that the HFT guys at the hedge fund must have realized really quickly what a morale booster that kind of thing would have been, and kept a lower backstop ask in place almost continuously from then on I'm sure others tried the same thing. Occasionally $1,000 and other high-dollar asks would peak through from time to time from then on, which told me the long-side HFTs were probably successfully sniping the backstops regularly.

So, translating for those of you who found that confusing. First, such a high ask is basically a FU to the short-side (who, as you remember, need to eventually buy shares to cover their short positions). More importantly, as an indicator of retail sentiment, it meant that NO ONE ELSE WAS TRYING TO SELL AT ANY PRICE LOWER THAN $5,000. Absolutely no one was bailing out.

I laughed for a minute, then started getting a little worried. Holy cow.. NO retail selling into the fear? How are they resisting that kind of price move??

The answer, as we all know now... they weren't afraid... they weren't even worried. They were F\*CKING PISSED.

Meanwhile the momentum guys and long-side HFTs keep gobbling up the generously donated shares that the short-side are plowing into their ladder attack. Lots of HFT duels going on as long-side HFTs try to intercept shares meant to travel between short-side HFT accounts for their ladder. You can tell when you see prices like $227.0001 constantly flying across the tape. Retail can't even attempt to enter an order like that--those are for the big boys with privileged low-latency access.

The fact that you can even see that on the tape with human eyes is really bad for the short-side people.

Why, you ask? Because it means liquidity is drying up, and fast.

The Liquidity Tide is Flowing Out Quickly. Who's Naked (short)?

Market technicals time. I still wish this sub would allow pictures so I could throw up a chart, but I guess a table will do fine.

DateVolumePrice at US Market CloseFriday, 1/22/21197,157,196$65.01Monday, 1/25/21177,874,00$76.79Tuesday, 1/26/21178,587,974$147.98Wednesday, 1/27/2193,396,666$347.51Thursday, 1/28/2158,815,805$193.60

What do I see? I see the shares available to trade dropping so fast that all the near-exchange compute power in the world won't let the short-side HFTs maintain order flow volume for their attacks. Many retail people asking me questions thought today was the heaviest trading. Nope--it was just the craziest.

What about the price dropping on Thursday? Is that a sign that the short-side pulled a miracle out and pushed price down against a parabolic move on even less volume than Wednesday? Is the long side running out of capital?

Nope. It means the short-side hedge funds are just about finished.

But wait, I thought the price needed to be higher for them to be taken out? How is it that price being lower is bad for them? Won't that allow them to cover at a lower price?

No, the volume is so low that they can't cover any meaningful fraction of their position without spiking the price parabolic almost instantly. Just not enough shares on offer at reasonable prices (especially when WSB keeps flashing you 6942.00s).

It's true, a higher price hurts, but the interest charge for one more day is just noise at this point. The only tick that will REALLY count is the last tick of trading on Friday.

In the meantime, the price drop (and watching the sparring in real time) tells me that the long-side whales and their HFT quants are so certain of the squeeze that they're no longer worried AT ALL about whether it will happen, and they aren't even worried at all about retail morale to help carry the water anymore.

Instead, they're now really, really worried about how CHEAPLY they can make it happen.

They are wondering if they can't edge out just a sliver more alpha out of what will already be a blow-out trade for the history books (probably). You see, to make it happen they just have to keep hoovering up shares. It doesn't matter what those shares cost. If you're certain that the squeeze is now locked in, why push the price up and pay more than you have to? Just keep pressing hard enough to force short-side to keep sending those tasty shares your way, but not so much you move the price. Short-side realizes this and doesn't try to drive price down too aggressively. They can't afford to let price run away, so they have to keep some pressure on at the lowest volume they can manage, but they don't want to push down too hard and give the long-side HFTs too deep of a discount and bleed their ammo out even faster. That dynamic keeps price within a narrow (for GME today, anyway) trading range for the rest of the day into the close.

Good plan guys, but those after market people are pushing the price up again. Damnit WSB bros and Euros, you're costing those poor long-side whales their extra 0.0000001% of alpha on this trade just so you can run up your green rockets... See, that's the kind of nonsense that just validates [Lee Cooperman's](https://youtu.be/mI-nItz56Fs?t=279) concerns.

On a totally unrelated note, I have to say that I appreciate the shift in CNBC's reporting. Much more thoughtful and informed. Just please get a good market technician in there who will be willing to talk about what is going on under the hood if possible. A lot of people watching on the sidelines are far more terrified than they need to be because it all looks random to them. And they're worried that you guys look confused and worried--and if the experts on the news are worried....??!

You should be able to find one who has access to the really good data that we retailers can only guess at, who can explain it to us unwashed masses.

Ok, So.. Questions

**There is no market justification for this. How can you tell me is this fundamentally sound and not just straight throwing money away irresponsibly??** *(side note: not that that should matter--if you want to throw your money away why shouldn't you be allowed to?)*

We're not trading in your securities pricing model. This isn't irrational just because your model says long and short positions are the same thing. The model is not a real market. There is asymmetrical counterparty risk here given the shorts are on the hook for all the money they have, and possibly all the money their brokers have, and possibly anyone with exposure to the broker too! You may want people to trade by the rules you want them to follow. But the rest of us trade in the real market as it is actually implemented. Remember? That's what you tell the retailers who take their accounts to zero. Remember what you told the KBIO short-squeezed people? They had fair warning that short positions carry infinite risk, including more than your initial investment. You guys know this. It's literally part of your job to know this.

But-but-the systemic risk!! This is Madness!

...Madness?

THIS. IS. **THE MARKET!!! \*Retail kicks the short-side hedge funds down an infinity loss black hole\***.

Ok, seriously though, that is actually a fundamentally sound, and properly profit-driven answer at least as justifiable as the hedge funds' justification for going &gt;100% of float short. If they can be allowed to gamble INFINITE LOSSES because they expect to make profit on the possibility the company goes bankrupt, can't others do the inverse on the possibility the company I don't know.. doesn't go bankrupt and gets a better strategy from the team that created what is now a $43bn market cap company (CHWY) that does exactly some of the things GME needs to do (digital revenue growth) maybe? I mean, I first bought in on that fundamental value thesis in the 30s and then upped my cost basis given the asymmetry of risk in the technical analysis as an obvious no-brainer momentum trade. The squeeze is just, as WSB people might say, tendies raining down from on high as an added bonus.

I get that you disagree on the fundamental viability of GME. Great. Isn't that what makes a market?

Regarding the consequences of a squeeze, in practice my expectation was maybe at worst some kind of ex-market settlement after liquidation of the funds with exposure to keep things nice and orderly for the rest of the market. I mean, they handled the VW thing somehow right? I see now that I just underestimated elite hedge fund managers though--those guys are so hardcore (I'll explain why I think so a bit lower down).

**If hedge fund people are so hardcore, how did the retail long side ever have a chance of winning this squeeze trade they're talking about?**

Because it's an asymmetrical battle once you have short interest cornered. And the risk is also crazily asymmetrical in favor of the long side if short interest is what it is in GME. In fact, the hedge funds essentially cornered themselves without anyone even doing anything. They just dug themselves right in there. Kind of impressive really, in a weird way.

What does the short side need to cover? They need the price to be low, and they need to buy shares.

How does price move lower? You have to push share volume such that supply overwhelms demand and price therefore goes down (man, I knew econ 101 would come in handy someday).

But wait... if you have to sell shares to push the price down.. won't you just undo all your work when you have to buy it back to actually cover?

The trick is you have to push price down so hard, so fast, so unpredictably, that you SCARE OTHER PEOPLE into selling their shares too, because they're scared of taking losses. Their sales help push the price down for free! and then you scoop them up at discount price! Also, there are ways to make people scared other than price movement and fear of losses, when you get right down to it. So, you know, you just need to get really, really, really good at making people scared. Remember to add a line item to your budget to make sure you can really do it right.

On the other hand..

What does the long side need to do? They need to own as much of the shares as they can get their hands on. And then they need to hold on to them. They can't be weak hands either. They need to be hands that will hold even under the most intense heat of battle, and the immense pressure of mind-numbing fear... they need to be as if they were made of... diamond... (oh wow, maybe those WSB people kind of have a point here).

Why does this matter? Because at some point the sell side will eventually run out of shares to borrow. They simply won't be there, because they'll be safely tucked away in the long-side's accounts. Once you run out of shares to borrow and sell, you have no way to move the price anymore. You can't just drop a fat stack--excuse me, I mean suitcase (we're talking hedge fund money here after all)--of Benjamins on the ticker tape directly. Only shares. No more shares, no way to have any direct effect on the price whatsoever.

Ok, doesn't that just mean trading stops? Can't you just out-wait the long side then?

Well, you could.. until someone on the long side puts 1 share up on a 69420 ask, and an even crazier person actually buys at that price on the last tick on a Friday. Let's just say it gets really bad at that point.

Ok.. but how do the retail people actually get paid?

Well, to be quite honest, it's entirely up to each of them individually. You've seen the volumes being thrown around the past week+. I guarantee you every single retailer out there could have printed money multiple times trading that flow. If they choose to, and time it well. Or they could lose it all--this is the market. Some of them apparently seem to have some plan, or an implicit trust in certain individuals to help them know when to punch out. Maybe it works out, but maybe not. There will be financial casualties on the field for sure--this is the bare-knuckled capitalist jungle after all, remember? But everyone ponied up to the table with their own money somehow, so they all get to play in the big leagues just like everyone else. In theory, anyway.

And now, Probably the #1 question I've been asked on all of these posts has been: **So what happens next?** Do we get the infinity squeeze? Do the hedge funds go down?

Great questions. I don't know. No one does. That's what I've said every time, but I get that's a frustrating answer, so I'll write a bit more and speculate further. Please again understand these are my opinions with a degree of speculation I wouldn't normally put in a post.

The Market and the Economy. Main Street, Wall Street, and Washington

The pandemic has hurt so many people that it's hard to comprehend. Honestly, I don't even pretend to be able to. I have been crazy fortunate enough to almost not be affected at all. Honestly, it is a little unnerving to me how great the disconnect is between people who are doing fine (or better than fine, looking at my IRA) versus the people who are on the opposite side of the ever-widening divide that, let's be honest, has been growing wider since long before the pandemic.

People on the other side--who have been told they cannot work even if they want to, who wonder if congress will get it together to at least keep them from getting thrown out of their house if they have to keep taking one for the team for the good of all, are wondering if they're even living in the same reality.

Because all they see on the news each day is that the stock market is at record highs, or some amazing tech stocks have 10x'd in the last 6 months. How can that be happening during a pandemic? Because The Market is not The Economy. The Market looks forward to that brighter future that Economy types just need to wait for. Don't worry--it'll be here sometime before the end of the year. We think. We're making money on that assumption right now, anyway. Oh, by the way, if you're in The Market, you get to get richer as a minor, unearned side-effect of the solutions our governments have come up with to fight the pandemic.

Wow. That sounds amazing. How do I get to part of that world?

Retail fintech, baby. Physical assets like real estate might be a bit out of reach at the moment, but stocks will do. I can even buy fractional shares of BRK/A LOL.

Finally, I can trade for my own slice of heaven, watching that balance go up (and up--go stonks!!). Now I too get to dream the dream. I get to feel connected to that mythical world, The Market, rather than being stuck in the plain old Economy. Sure, I might blow up my account, but that's because it's the jungle. Bare-knuckled, big league capitalism going on right here, and at least I get to show up an put my shares on the table with everyone else. At least I'm playing the same game. Everyone has to start somewhere--at least now I get to start, even if I have to learn my lesson by zeroing my account a few times. I've basically had to deal with what felt like my life zeroing out a few times before. This is number on a screen going to 0 is nothing.

Laugh or cry, right? I'll post my losses on WSB and at least get some laughs.

Geez, some of the people here are making bank. I better learn from them and see if they'll let me in on their trades. Wow... this actually might work. I don't understand yet, but I trust these guys telling me to hold onto this crazy trade. I don't understand it, but all the memes say it's going to be big.

...WOW... I can pay off my credit card with this number. Do I punch out now? No? Hold?... Ok, getting nervous watching the number go down but I trust you freaks. We're still in the jungle, but at least I'm in with with my posse now. Market open tomorrow--we ride the rocket baby! And if it goes down, at least I'm going down with my crew. At least if that happens the memes will be so hilarious I'll forget to cry.

Wow.. I can't believe it... we might actually pull this off. Laugh at us now, "pros"!

We're in The Market now, and Market rules tell us what is going to happen. We're getting all that hedge fund money Right? Right?

Maybe.

First, I say maybe because nothing is ever guaranteed until it clears. Secondly, because the rules of The Market are not as perfectly enforced as we would like to assume. We are also finding out they may not be perfectly fair. The Market most experts are willing to talk about is really more like the ideal The Market is supposed to be. This is the version of the market I make my trading decisions in. However, the Real Market gets strange and unpredictable at the edges, when things are taken to extremes, or rules are pushed beyond the breaking point, or some of the mechanics deep in the guts of the Real Market get stretched. GME ticks basically all of those boxes, which is why so many people are getting nervous (aside from the crazy money they might lose). It's also important to remember that the sheer amount of money flowing through the market has distorting power unto itself. Because it's money, and people really, really, really like their money--especially when they're used to having a lot of it, and rules involving that kind of money tend to look more... flexible, shall we say.

Ok, back to GME. If this situation with GME is allowed to play out to its conclusion in The Market, we'll see what happens. I think all the long-side people get the chance to be paid (what, I'm not sure--and remember, you have to actually sell your position at some point or it's all still just numbers on your screen), but no one knows for certain.

But this might legitimately get so big that it spills out of The Market and back into The Economy.

Geez, and here I thought the point of all of this was so that we all get to make so much money we wouldn't ever have to think and worry about that thing again.

Unfortunately, while he's kind of a buzzkill, [Thomas Petterfy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM) has a point. This could be a serious problem.

It might blow out The Market, which will definitely crap on The Economy, which as we all know from hard experience, will seriously crush Main Street.

If it's that big a deal, we may even need Washington to be involved. Once that happens, who knows what to expect.. this kind of scenario being possible is why I've been saying I have no idea how this ends, and no one else does either.

How did we end up in this ridiculous situation? From GAMESTOP?? And it's not Retail's fault the situation is what it is.. why is everyone telling US that we need to back down to save The Market?? What about the short-side hedge funds that slammed that risk into the system to begin with?? We're just playing by the rules of The Market!!

Well, here are my thoughts, opinions, and some even further speculation... This may be total fantasy land stuff here, but since I keep getting asked I'll share anyway. Just keep that disclaimer in mind.

A Study in Big Finance Power Moves: If you owe the bank $10,000, it's your problem...

What happens when you owe money you have no way to pay back? It's a scary question to have to face personally. Still, on balance and on average, if you're fortunate enough to have access to credit the borrowing is a risk that is worth taking (especially if you're reasonably careful). Lenders can take a risk loaning you money, you take a risk by borrowing in order to do something now that you would otherwise have had to wait a long time or maybe would never have realistically been able to do otherwise. Sometimes it doesn't work out. Sometimes it's due to reasons totally beyond your control. In any case, if you find yourself there you have no choice but to dust yourself off, pick yourself up as best as you can, and try to move on and rebuild. A lot of people had to learn that in 2008. Man that year really sucked.

Wall street learned their lessons too. Most learned what I think most of us would consider the right lessons--lessons about risk management, and the need to guard vigilantly against systemic risk, concentration of risk through excess concentration of leverage on common assets, etc. Many suspect that at least a few others may have learned an entirely different set of, shall we say, unhealthy lessons. Also, to try to be completely fair, maybe managing other peoples' money on 10x+ leverage comes with a kind of pressure that just clouds your judgement. I could actually, genuinely buy that. I know I make mistakes under pressure even when I'm trading risk capital I could totally lose with no real consequence. Whatever the motive, here's my read on what's happening:

First, remember that as much fun as WSB are making of the short-side hedge fund guys right now, those guys are smart. Scary smart. Keep that in mind.

Next, let's put ourselves in their shoes.

If you're a high-alpha hedge fund manager slinging trades on a $20bn 10x leveraged to 200bn portfolio, get caught in a bad situation, and are down mark-to-market several hundred million.. what do you do? Do you take your losses and try again next time? Hell no.

You're elite. You don't realize losses--you double down--you can still save this trade no sweat.

But what if that doesn't work out so well and you're in the hole &gt;$2bn? Obvious double down. Need you ask? I'm net up on the rest of my positions (of course), and the momentum when this thing makes its mean reversion move will be so hot you can almost taste the alpha from here. Speaking of momentum, imagine the move if your friends on TV start hyping the story harder! Genius!

Ok, so that still didn't work... this is now a frigging 7 sigma departure from your modeled risk, and you're now locked into a situation that is about as close to mathematically impossible to escape as you can get in the real world, and quickly converging on infinite downside. Holy crap. The fund might be liquidated by your prime broker by tomorrow morning--and man, even the broker is freaking out. F'in Elon Musk and his twitter! You're cancelling your advance booking on his rocket ship to Mars first thing tomorrow... Ok, focus--this might legit impact your total annual return. You need a plan, and you know the smartest people on the planet, right? The masters of the universe! Awesome--they've even seen this kind of thing before and still have the playbook!! Of course! It's obvious now--you borrow a few more billion and double down again first thing in the morning. So simple. Sticky note that Mars trip cancellation so you don't forget.

Ok... so that didn't work? You even cashed in some pretty heavy chits too. Ah well, that was a long shot anyway. So where were you? Oh yeah.. if shenanigans don't work, skip to page 10...

...Which says, of course, to double down again. Anyone even keeping track anymore? Oh, S3 says it's $40bn and we're going parabolic? Man, that chart gives me goosebumps. All according to plan...

***So what happens tomorrow? One possible outcome of PURE FANTASTIC SPECULATION...***

End of the week--phew. Never though it'd come. Where are you at now?... Over $9000\*!!! Wow. You did it boys, and as a bonus the memes will be so sweet.

\**side note: add 8 zeros to the end...*

Awesome--your problems have been solved. Because...

..

**BOOM**

Now it's **EVERYONE's** problem. [Come at me, Chamath](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1353886305277472768), **THIS** is **REAL** baller shit.

Now all you gotta do is make all the hysterical retirees watching their IRAs hanging in the balance blame those WSB kids. Hahaha. Boomers, amirite? hate when those kids step on their law--I mean IRAs. GG guys, keep you memes. THAT is how it's done.

Ok, but seriously, I hope that's not how it ends. I guess we just take it day by day at this point.

Apologies for the length. Good luck in the market!

Also, apologies in advance for formatting, spelling, and grammatical errors. I was typing this thing in between doing all kinds of other things for most of the day.

Title: Connecting GME Citadel TSLA
  

TL;DR: Fuck off, this only takes 5 minutes to ready, maybe 7 for some of you slower autists. But fine TSLA 2/5 $1000 C, 2/12 $1000 C, 2/19 $1000 C. Pick any date. Also dont fucking sell a share/option of GME. Disclaimer: not financial advice

Congress and media will use Robinhood as the scapegoat but the real issue here is Citadel.  Dont get me wrong, Robinhood deserves all the shit its going to get thrown at. After the call with Citadel, Vlad couldve told them to fuck off, We built Robinhood for the people. He couldve raised margins to 100% for those stocks, something reasonable, but no he caved into Citadels request. But destroying Robinhood isnt going to stop the problem.

[https://fortune.com/2020/07/08/robinhood-makes-millions-selling-your-stock-trades-is-that-so-wrong/](https://fortune.com/2020/07/08/robinhood-makes-millions-selling-your-stock-trades-is-that-so-wrong/)

For those of you that dont know, Citadel is a Market Maker. They are literally the definition of Market Manipulation. Im not going to explain that to you, look it up. All done now? Good we can move on. They make their money selling option contracts. How is that manipulating the market you ask? Well, it is when you have brokers like Robinhood selling you data and you working with shorts keeping prices down. Why else do you think they bailed out Melvin? Connect the dots you autists!

Nothing will happen with them anytime soon because they have paid off everyone that could expose them. Everyone on Wallstreet knows this, everyone in government knows this. Yes even AOC, even fuckin Ted Cruz whos just clout chasing (His wifes a top exec at GS, he knows this shit, he knows nothing is going to happen.) AOC hinted of this during her Twitch stream yesterday. Congress has BS committees whose job is to make money. They even paid off Janet Yellen. She aint no JPow.

[https://nypost.com/2021/01/28/wh-shouldnt-be-a-surprise-yellen-paid-to-speak-to-wall-street/](https://nypost.com/2021/01/28/wh-shouldnt-be-a-surprise-yellen-paid-to-speak-to-wall-street/)

Your natural follow up question is okay how do we stop Citadel if they have so much pull? The simple answer buy fuckin TSLA because Elon is papa. Im not going to bore you with all the TSLA DD because theyre all over this subreddit and all over twitter. If you fuckin reply with gordon johnson, teslacharts, or mark spiegel, fuck off you really are a retard. The only thing I will touch upon is FSD. Listen to the earnings call. Elon says theyll start offering FSD subscription in 1-2 months for $200 per month. Ill do the math for you autists taking into account that only 20% of drivers will pay for that (thats a lowball number). Theres currently roughly 1 million Teslas on the road capable of FSD.

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/502208/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-deliveries/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/502208/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-deliveries/)

If you take a 20% FSD take rate of those 1 million Teslas, thats 480mil revenue yearly just from FSD alone the first year. This is not including the 800k+ deliveries expected this year. By 2025, when theres roughly 5 million Teslas on the road, FSD revenue will be about 2.4 billion annually.  Dont listen to all the FUD on how Tesla missed EPS or auto margin % is down. Those analysts are missing the big picture. This is why even Elon himself said Tesla is well worth the 1 trillion valuation

Okay lets get back on track because those of you who made it here want to know how to expose Citadel. Not only are they a Market Maker, theyre a known Tesla Market Maker.

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/hedge-fund-citadel-discloses-huge-stake-tesla-stock-51587762771](https://www.barrons.com/articles/hedge-fund-citadel-discloses-huge-stake-tesla-stock-51587762771)

Theyve been manipulating the price on Tesla for years. The media have helped make their jobs much easier. Watch CNBC, thats all the evidence you need. You know who else is short Tesla that connects all of this with GME? You guessed it: Melvin fuckin Capital. 

[https://lostinthoughtt.medium.com/elon-musk-tweets-about-gme-because-melvin-capital-shorted-tsla-for-years-6d00512080c5](https://lostinthoughtt.medium.com/elon-musk-tweets-about-gme-because-melvin-capital-shorted-tsla-for-years-6d00512080c5)

Where do you think all that money that Citadel is bailing Melvin out with is going to go? Yup shorting Tesla. Who else is going to benefit from that? If you guessed Citadel, come on down and get your free stock. Before I get to my next point, lets take a look at Tesla short interest.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/short-interest](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/short-interest)

As of 1/15, there is still 56mil shares shorted. Thats a whopping 46-47 billion $ worth of shorts (3x that of GME). To add on to those shorts, theres also a new synthetic short made by Tesla joining the SP500. To summarize for you, there are active funds which track the performance of SP500. At the end of the year, theyre judge by how well they do with respect to the index. A surprising amount of them still do not own Tesla so YTD, they are well behind the index due to not owning any Tesla. A good amount of them are waiting until post Q4 earnings (now) to buy shares thus creating a synthetic short.

[https://twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1344267081018175489?s=20](https://twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1344267081018175489?s=20)

How do we get the ball rolling? The same idea as GME, buy what TSLA you want, force Citadel to start having to buy shares for their calls, get these synthetic shorts to start buying and you can probably guess what happens next. This time, if they decide to pull the same shit, they cant say theyre protecting the investor because Tesla is a great investment. Congress and Joe cant say theyre for climate change if theyre going to choose the likes of Citadel over Tesla. 

With that, I want to end this and remind you again to NOT FUCKIN SELL GME. If you have to take, some profits from the rest of your portfolio. Im selling everything else in my portfolio and going all in on TSLA and GME.

TO THE MOON

Title: THEY CAN'T BAN PURCHASES OF AN ETF - BUY SILVER ($SLV)
Buy the underlying shares $SLV *and* April/June calls to create a gamma squeeze. Concise bull case:

1) the PM market is manipulated to high heaven

2) Silver is needed now more than ever (solar, electronics)

3) Paper Silver (the etf) exceeds the physical supply by magnitudes 

4) the gold to silver ratio is way off and bound to revert back to the mean

5) there are inflation concerns and silver is a good hedge

6) Boomers like Silver 

7) JP Morgan is shorting this market

If enough people demand physical delivery of silver there isn't enough to do it and JPM will be forced to buy their way out.  Commodities must trade to their true value.  (see oil in May).  

The short squeeze will be EPIC if we can pull this off.  LETS GO

Title: NOK DD ahead of earnings (Feb 4th)
This is not a distraction from GME or any other stock. This is just a simple DD on why NOK could moon ahead of its earnings report (Feb 4th).

**1) 5G. 5G. 5G. 5G. NOK is a leader in the 5G technology space and there are plenty of reasons why 5G will create additional upside in the stock.**

* 5G paves the way for autonomous vehicles
* NOK was Selected for U.S. Federal 5G Security Project

**2) This is a technology company (think TSLA, AAPL, AMZN) and not an old phone company.** 

* NOK is a major contender in the cybersecurity AND AI autonomous vehicles space. The company has partnerships with other large companies in both the United States and  Europe. This means GROWTH GROWTH &amp; GROWTH which is what investors care about. 

**3) Remember that Trump launched the Space Divison last year? How much money does the United States spend on defense every year? &gt;&gt; $750Bn**

* In 2020 NASA awarded Nokia (NOK) first mobile cellular network on the moon (no pun intended here). Stocks pertaining to the Space economy are a new emerging sector  right now. You're seeing all these Space ETFS coming into the market.  This new emerging space economy is worth around $2 trillion. 

**4) THE STOCK HAS BARELY MOVED YET.**

* I took this information from wsbtrack:
   * GME - 36% of reddit trading the stock - up 1036% this month
   * AMC - 16% of reddit trading teh stock - up 326% this month
   * NOK - 10% of reddit trading the stock - up 25% this month

I am long Feb-05-2021 $5 Call Option \[50 contracts\] into the earnings report on Feubrary-04-2021. I paid 65c for it. NOK has to be above 5.65 for me to breakeven.

**DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. DO YOUR OWN DUE DILIGENCE. I LIKE THE STOCK.**

Title: Friendly reminder for GME
We are all into this stock together. It is our time to feast and eat from the wealthy fucks from wallstreet. 

A lot of different ages are involved in this stock and some of them are old enough to remember 2008 and some dont. 

Wallstreet took advantage of the middle class people and made millions of people homeless (not only in USA). Dads and moms that had nothing left to live for beside their kids. 

They got away with it and have been doing the same trick for years. This time, we got them by the balls and will drag them fucking down. 

Goodluck all. Hold or buy.

Title: Amarin Corporation About To Shift From Loss To Profit
With the business potentially at an important milestone, we thought we'd take a closer look at Amarin Corporation ($AMRN) future prospects. Amarin Corporation plc, a pharmaceutical company, develops and commercializes therapeutics for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases in the United States. The US$2.9b market-cap companys loss lessened since it announced a US$23m loss in the full financial year, compared to the latest trailing-twelve-month loss of US$16m, as it approaches breakeven. Many investors are wondering about the rate at which Amarin will turn a profit, with the big question being when will the company breakeven? Below we will provide a high-level summary of the industry analysts expectations for the company.

According to the 11 industry analysts covering Amarin, the consensus is that breakeven is near. They anticipate the company to incur a final loss in 2020, before generating positive profits of US$11m in 2021. Therefore, the company is expected to breakeven roughly a year from now or less! At what rate will the company have to grow in order to realise the consensus estimates forecasting breakeven in under 12 months? Using a line of best fit, we calculated an average annual growth rate of 61%, which is rather optimistic! If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, the company may become profitable much later than analysts predict.

Given this is a high-level overview, we wont go into details of Amarin's upcoming projects, but, keep in mind that typically biotechs, depending on the stage of product development, have irregular periods of cash flow. So, a high growth rate is not out of the ordinary, particularly when a company is in a period of investment.

Before we wrap up, theres one aspect worth mentioning. The company has managed its capital prudently, with debt making up 1.6% of equity. This means that it has predominantly funded its operations from equity capital, and its low debt obligation reduces the risk around investing in the loss-making company.

Title: Why you should get into SLV and why it is a solid play 
The metal silver is currently shorted and all the redditors will get into SLV once GME  short squeeze is over. The SLV has been trading between 22-26$ for the past few days and a simply google search will tell you why the prices of silver are going to rocket.

There have been multiple DDs regarding SLV on this subreddit. If you want to look at the one that I wrote in the morning today then simply look at my pinned post. 


The IV ON SLV IS REALLY LOW WHICH MEANS CONTRACTS ARE CHEAPER. AG has high IV so I am moving more towards SLV.


THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE. Do your own research. 

Positions - 4/16 30cs and 2/19 27cs 

P.S - Dont give me awards. Use that award to buy GME, wait for short squeeze and once its over then jump into SLV.


                                                               

Title: Your GME shares might be lent to shortsellers
Your GME shares might be lent to shortsellers

This information has been discussed frequently the last view weeks, but may be new to the millions of autists and retards that joined in the last few days. You might be suppressing the stock by allowing your shares to be lent out to shorters.

"When can my shares be lent out?":

If you have a margin account and are using the margin your shares are lent out by your broker to short sellers. Same thing when you are in a share lending program, IBKR and Schwab have those for example.

"How can I make it stop?":

If it's possible cancel your enrollment in the share lending program or buy new stocks only in a cash account or something. But I'm retarded and no financial advisor so better google and look in here (the post I mostly ripped off for this). https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kn3767/gme_gang_share_lending_education_for_dummies/ BTW I like GME

Title: $HIMS, your wife's new BF
Look you wonderful  autists,

I'm here to provide another yolo target, $HIMS. $HIMS is not some  behind Wendy's or your wife's "special friend" but instead a tech company focusing on telehealth. They have 2 brands, "hims" which focuses on male health (99.9999% of wsb) and "hers" for female health.

None of this means anything except that Auntie Cathie added shares to her fund, ARK investments, on Wednesday. I don't know anything (I am a retard of course) but I do know that Auntie Cathie is:

1. Sexy
2. Good at picking stonks
3. Longed $TSLA before it was cool
4. Added $PLTR to her funds last week or so ago and it has mega mooned since then. (Don't ask me wtf $PLTR does because I don't know either.)

tl:dr  Also Auntie Cathie bought $HIMS 

Position: 1500 shares

Title: A BIG OL FUCKIN RED DAY MAY BE COMING
First off, congratulations and holy fuck to those of you in the GME Squeeze. I was a doubter. I missed the boat entirely, but I bought 3 shares this morning at an average of 334 and Ill hold to oblivion. Seriously. This 1k means absolutely nothing to me. I went 99.9% cash yesterday and I will hold this last tiny remaining position until its a penny or I hit my sell limit at $4200.

Some of you may have seen this post yesterday 

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7bpf5/30_seconds_from_triggering_market_nuclear_bomb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

I believe this is true. 

This explains the broad market selloff of everything besides squeeze stocks this past week aside from yesterday, and the continued bleed today now that the strategy of forcing the squeezers out by restricting trade seems to have failed. 

I had 20k wiped off my account value in hours the other day. Thats not important because it was house money. Whats important is *what caused that fear* and the answer to that may be: a liquidity crisis. 

What happens if brokers like IBKR and RH fail? If they are forced to admit margin is ineffective, their risk management systems are flawed, and short squeeze scenarios like this reveal that *they do not have the ability to cover the cash that flows through their institutions*? 

What happens if these hedge funds who went naked short get fully liquidated in margin calls *and dont have the money to back it up?*

Not only are we bound to see a *firestorm* of legislation that could scare the markets, the actual *void* of money that will be created could tank everything. 

What would the impacts be of Robinhood failing? Of *everyone* who has their money in the market via RH pulls out because theyre not sure that their broker actually *has* the money to pay them? 

TLDR: If the squeeze gets fully squoze, I am pretty certain the entire market will tank. Therefore, please keep squeezing, because I want cheap stocks.

Title: THERE IS ANOTHER SHORT LADDER HAPPENING KEEP BUYING THE DISCOUNT GME TO 5K 
JUST A REMINDER: Shorts don't have an expiration date!

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.** 

#WE LIKE THE STOCK 

#KEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK

Title: To all you newbies go buy stuff from GME and/or get the PowerUp membership TODAY
The electronic only PowerUp Rewards membership is actually a pretty good deal since you get monthly coupons. The app is pretty well put together but a little glitchy at times. I am assuming Cohen is going to put some manpower behind that in the coming months to make it better.

If the squeeze does not happen soon the shorts will hold on until the earnings report and GME's quarter ends this month.

Title: $STPK TENDIES 
DD on $STPK

Stem Inc. ($STPK) is an energy storage company focusing on battery storage systems, network integration, and battery optimization. They brand themselves as "the first pure play smart energy storage company to go public" - a lot of buzz words I know but bear with me

First, let's take a moment to quickly understand how battery storage works. Battery storage is a type of energy storage power station that uses a group of batteries to store electrical energy. This is primarily used in the renewables space with solar and wind energy. In recent years battery storage (and in part renewable energy) hasn't seen the exponential growth that many are expecting due to limitations in battery technology and high development costs.

This being said, recent developments of battery tech and reduction of costs have now made battery storage much more feasible at the commercial / industrial level. Battery storage still has ways to go in the residential space due to risks that come with it.

https://preview.redd.it/xy2e3iml1yb61.png?width=2230&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8c903a5ac25ef5d70ad9993880886010df73d32

While battery storage has improved, it will not be stand alone solution for many years to come because it simply isn't feasible with our global energy infrastructure. Battery storage will work with our interconnected grid to reduce imbalances between energy demand and energy production.

Ok, so now that we know how it works, what does the market look like?

* All major global markets are forecasted to double over the next decade
* Over the next decade, the US market is expected to grow at \~45% CAGR and the global market is expected to grow 31% CAGR
* Future tailwinds with improvements in the regulatory environment

https://preview.redd.it/7x98ssvk1yb61.png?width=2236&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94e525ba6bab348a408ec2b59297d03cbcf5b896

Great, so how is $STPK revolutionizing this space? They are doing so by providing a "one stop shop" solution for utility companies. Stem's solution can provide integrations with hardware (batteries) and the grid (network), while also using an AI powered software solution to optimize their energy storage.

https://preview.redd.it/ljxci0lu3yb61.png?width=2208&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2728140badcbc979109ce3c895f65d3e6057b26

Their solution could possible replace other pure play companies in the value chain which is key.

Interesting, so let's move on to their AI software called Athena. Athena is an operating system for energy distribution and storage systems, collecting big data that enables customers to alternate between onsite generation, grid power or battery power.

https://preview.redd.it/gdctb7fs1yb61.png?width=2230&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9d3265db7fc1978a56bece0b8cac1385bac36f1

Athena is a HUGE part of their value proposition and truly could be revolutionary. It is a large part of their moat, as they have 24 issued patents for it (so no competitor can replicate it).

Now, let's move onto their financials. First, it's important to understand they have a hardware and software business

* Increased rev from $17 mil to $33 mil YoY, expected to increase to $147 mil in 2021
* 81% CAGR from 2020-2026
* Gross margins have hovered around 12-18% since 2018 but expected to increase to 40%+ by 2026
* 90% of forecasted 2021 revs are from closed executed contracts (not pipeline!) -&gt; underpromising and overdelivering
* Software revenue expected to account for 30% of total revenues by 2026
   * $14 mil in 2020 -&gt; $240 mil by 2026

https://preview.redd.it/9mzekzoz1yb61.png?width=2224&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b5311875074372dab260a03471227a503c31641

A majority of their revenues are from their hardware segment but it will be interesting to see how Athena contributes to their financials moving forward. They need to execute yes, but I'm confident they can do so given it has been in development for 5+ years, and they have continuously improved upon due to years of data collection. They might have used this time to validate Athena with their customers and now feel comfortable scaling it exponentially.

Lastly, I was curious to see how they compare to Tesla as well all know a large part of Tesla's valuation is their energy business. Interestingly enough, they actually use batteries from Tesla, Samsung, and Panasonic. Additionally, they have a partnership with Tesla.

https://preview.redd.it/0xxgetre2yb61.png?width=1376&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb1046d1c13b9ea7363515171e0986eae45fbd0e

In my opinion, this is an extremely attractive play in the renewables space as it is one of the pick and shovel plays in the space.

TLDR: Stem is a leading player in the energy storage market as they have solutions to address all major aspects of the value chain. More specifically:

* Large TAM + strong macro tailwinds
   * \~$1.2 trillion in new revenue opportunities for integrated storage expected to be deployed by 2050
   * Battery storage capacity expected to increase by 25x by 2030
* Market leader with best in class technology
   * 900+ systems operating or contracted with Athena
   * 75% market share in CA BTM storage market, largest in the US
   * First mover AI platform that operates with 40+ utilities, 5 grid operators and over 16MM runtime hours
* Highly visible growth
   * Recurring revenue streams provide strong financial position to accelerate growth
   * Revenues projected to grow at \~51% CAGR from 2021 to 2026

Title: ROCKET MORTGAGE (rkt) to rocket up to the moon. Price target 160 and trading st 23. Short interest increasing higher for the last 6 months every week
Guys everyone is missing that rkt has 36% interest and is a digital disruptor. 

1) they made 3.6B last QUARTER alone from 6B in revenue. Thats 65% margin!!
2) short interest is 36% and get this, they only went public 4 months ago and they are already buying back $1B stock!! Where have you ever seen anyone that goes public do a buyback this big so soon?!
3) they have no credit risk, i sent email to investor relations and their balance sheet shows the loans they make but they said they sell 100% of them back, 98% to the government and 2% to third parties so there is no credit risk here!! This is what the shorts are missing because theyre lazy
4) on the last earnings call the ceo said they will announce a huge new partnership when they announce their next quarter and they said today that will be on 2/25
5) valuation: guys they will make 8B in profits this year on 14B in revenue and their entire market cap is just 45B!! This means they are trading at 5.5 times their PROFIT! the typical stock has a PE of 20 so this could be 4x and that DOES NOT even include the short interest
6) rkt ceo was on cnbc today and said we know our partnerships and our profitability and this is not a stock you want to be short
7) so many ipos come out and rise 100% right seay and then go much higher. Rkt is super profitable and they went public at 18.50 and at 23 theyre barely up and have beaten big on both their last quarters

Title: Any big drops with low volumes are likely short ladder attack!
Just a friendly reminder that big drops in price could very likely be because of short ladder attacks where the funds sell their stocks back and forth to artificially drop the price. This is usually an attempt to scare people to sell. They did it yesterday to.

The only thing you can do is hold and remove stop losses so they don't get triggered. Usually after the attack the stop goes back up.

Hey fellow tards, 

Just some really easy math here to encourage you to hold... we now have 6 million members, if each of us holds 2 shares (which i think is actually kind of conservative) we have 12 million shares among us. 

GME float is \~47m shares

Therefore reddit holds about 25% of the float 

Fucking hold. This is actually an end game.

Title: $GME Dont fall for it. Volume is low.
Disclaimer: I have a history degree and dropped out of business school. If you take this seriously youre an asshole. 


GME volume is super low. Volume = number of shares that changed hands. 

Theyre trading basically zero shares. The prices indicated are pure smoke and mirrors at this point. 

Dont fall for it. Hold. 


And if youre on robinhood and would like to see volume, click the arrows on the price graph to expand. Then click the volume button on top right. 

The volume will be updated in 5 minute intervals on a bar chart on the bottom of the graph. 

Hover over to see how many shares were traded in that span.

Title: $SCHW SCHWAB TO BENEFIT THE MOST FROM THIS FIASCO $SCHW (AMERITRADE + SCHWAB)
**Charles Schwab/TD Ameritrade and Fidelity** were the only large brokerages that did not lock out its users and allow massive market manipulation by Citadel.

$SCHW owns and operates both TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab and has the most to gain from this Citadel/market manipulation fiasco.

We should show some love to $SCHW by the best way possible - buying the fuck out of the stock and transferring over your investments/holdings. I would also go long Fidelity investments but it is not publicly traded.

We need to send **RobinHood, ETrade** and **Webull** a message by leaving their brokerages in the masses. **We will not tolerate Market Manipulation.** This will be the fastest way to say FUCK YOU to each platform. The upcoming class action lawsuites will decide their fate later.

**User Growth:**

The amount of brand new retail investors opening up accounts over the past week is ridiculous. GME + AMC + BB pump has been blasted across every media station. Even my girlfriend's boyfriend signed up and asked me for investing advice.

Combine that with all the upset Robinhood, E Trade, WeBull users that will be transferring their investments/holdings to Fidelity/Ameritrade/Schwab next week.

More users = more deposits/commission = more profits = stonks go up

**Discount:**

$SCHW is trading at a 16% discount (as of PM on Friday) from its January high all while new retail investors and user registrations and deposits reached an all time high over the past week.

Schwab and TD Ameritrade were so overloaded that it was experiencing a slow down over the past few days due to the insane amount of new retail investors and increased usage.

**Average Daily Users**

The average daily website users has seen almost a 20% increase from the October 2020 numbers to December 2020 alone. The January numbers will even be substantially higher with TD Ameritrade and Schwab both reporting network strain due to the influx of new investors signing up last week to get into GME/AMC/BB. This trend wont be stopping anytime soon, the retail investor's strength is gaining. Just look at Wallstreetbets alone we had 2.2 million members as of Monday and now we are sitting at 5.8 million.

**Upcoming Earnings**

$SCHW is going to absolutely destroy upcoming earnings. They acquired TD Ameritrade on October 6. The amount of new retail investors has exploded over the last couple of months. Everyone seems to be investing with their tendy money. Just look at last years growth in new accounts. Current Q1 2021 numbers will blow away these registrations to the point that the servers were overloaded the past week with so many registrations. Their next earnings report for Q1 2021 will be the first quarter with 3 full months of combined revenue from both TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab. There will also be a mass exodus of upset traders fleeing Webull, Etrade and Robinhood by the thousands and transfers their assets into TD Ameritrade and Schwab.

**Future/Longevity of Brokerages:**

TD Ameritrade/Schwab will be one of the few brokerages not being slammed by class action lawsuites as a result of the manipulation today. E Trade, RobinHood and Webull will have users fleeing in the masses to new brokerages. Do you really want to leave your money sitting on a brokerages that may have pending lawsuites against it and possible liquidity issues?

**Price Target:** Bank of America just upgraded $SCHW on January 12 giving it a $68 target. Stating their has been mass growth in retail users. This was prior to the new user explosion the past 2 weeks. This stock will easily run to $70 once data comes out for January 2021 on the amount of new users and transfers.

**TLDR:** Transfer your money/holdings from your scumbag brokerages into TD Ameritrade/Schwab since it was one of the only brokerages who didn't lock out its users. Combine that with expected next earnings beat thanks to growth in retail users + account transfers. Load up in calls in the process and get rich as we send it to the moon. Fuck RH, WeBull, ETrade. LONG $SCHW and show it some love

DIRT CHEAP, Can run back to 57.5 just on a market rally alone, with media coverage and WSB support we will see 60$+ next week.

There will be a shit storm of news against Robinhood for class action lawsuites and traders transferring their assets. $SCHW will run all next week as a result.

Title: MOON LANDING PRICE DISCOVERED!!! Probing Possible Sell Prices on Robinhood
Listen up You beautiful tards!  


I hope yall are eating some nice tendies today covered in that sweet dip.  


I've been probing Robinhood's sell order capabilities because I initially had the retarded thought that I could sell for literally infinitely high price, so I tried to set an order at the max allowable by robinhood 10,000,000 but that was apparently retarded and Robinhood accepted it at first and canceled my buy limit this morning.  Ive been since probing the system since it rejected all of my meme prices at 42,069, ETC.  


I think i found the line, somewhere between 9800(accepted) and 9999(rejected).  SO YOU BEAUTIFUL TARDS ON ROBINHOOD THE MOON LANDING IS AT 9800!!!!!!!!!

Title: GPRO - Let it RUN!
Posting another DD on GPRO from a financial perspective. I know words are hard for you retards so maybe numbers will help.

GoPros revenue is expected to be \~$1B for 20 (slight decline admittedly but thats due to COVID) which means their market cap is currently only 1.4x their revenues. That is dirt cheap.

I dont think PE is appropriate for this stock so lets look at FCF. As mentioned in my original post \[Link\], GoPro is expected to generate \~$100M of revenue from the subscriptions @ 50% margin is $50M. That along with its camera sales should get it around \~$100M of FCF. This means the company is only trading around 14x FCF!!!

Taking a look at just one competitor (Garmin: GRMN) they are trading at 40x FCF. Not a clean competitor but a competitor still.

They also rolled their debt at a lower interest rate. If the outlook for the company truly got worse, despite decreasing rates, the debt price would not have really changed. Theyre turning a corner.

Dont sleep on this one.

TLDR: GoPro makes cameras and generates cash

Title: Pernicious Investment Corporations and Boomer Money, The Inside Scoop!
We have seen all manner of perfidy coming from the MM while pushing their buttons with GameStop. Something has happened here\~\~some of us have great insight into exactly what has taken place. The big question at this point will be: is there going to be the full-scale investigation into these big firms, and the way they manage money, that we deserve? And--once becoming aware of the consequences of their perfidy--will we have the guts to shut them down and face the consequences that they've been holding over our heads this whole time?  


Here's the case for why society is going to want to pull curtains over the whole thing from here:  
These big investment firms--like Citadel--have all of this entrenched legal power. They control all of the inside aspects of the market economy; they trade around retail, they don't pay taxes. They scalp bits of money from all different corners of the marketplace. They are quite literally, parasites on our civilization. And\~\~here's the kicker: they're playing with boomer money.  


From what I can infer, as long as these companies' bottom lines haven't been breached, they're able to leverage all of their equity however they want--but they have a top line, too! This past week, we've seen the market come down as a whole--just a little bit--because these big firms had to take money out of the game to pay off their top line balance.  


Now--here's the big question: do these companies, shorting GameStop, have to cover their shorts tonight? I'm sure you've all seen the post by zerohedge--120% short float, 2.1 days to cover. What does this mean? Does it mean what we think it will mean?

What it seems to suggest is that they have until MIDNIGHT, TONIGHT, to pay off their shorts\~\~so, here's where things get interesting... Their goal, then, is to keep GME as low as possible, so that--tricky, tricky--they can cover their shorts \*after hours\*. Yeah--they don't want you to have that MOASS...  


So\~\~what's the MM's plan? Well, this would be it, if I were to guess...  
Manipulate the market today, by limiting the calls / puts they sell you, to try to buy up as many calls dated for next week as possible, and as many puts as possible. Going into after hours, they will--probably in some dark black pool that we won't even notice--pay down their covers--resulting in a massive squeeze come Monday morning, where the price will have skyrocketed\~\~1,800/share, I don't know\~\~and, woah! There will be a rush to cash in on those calls! But... Low and behold--you can't. Why? Because the MM control your broker. Then, the price crashes. Shit! You couldn't do anything about it! They sell all of those shares they covered, and cash in on their puts...  


So--this is clearly illegal, and these people deserve to face the consequences of their actions, right?  


Well--not so fast, there, cowboy. Because if they do have to pay up, that means they're going to have to liquidate their equity...  


Give you a second to think about that...  


What does that mean..?  


It means they're going to dig into the boomer's retirement 401k's to pay out. Oh--so what? It's only a few hundred billion or so, or whatever, right? What harm could it do to the economy? Well--consider this... The mass retirement age of the boomer population is in 2022.

Did you think that the market would want to keep their money in the market to give boomer's a nice retirement?.. Absolutely not. The MM plan on divesting from the stock market before boomers start cashing out\~\~as soon as the inflows start coming in, they're crashing the whole game and making off with their prize winnings.  


So\~\~what happens when we launch a legal investigation into Citadel, and demand justice. Demand that they stop playing this game, and preying off of the people's money?  


They crash the stock market.

Title: 10 Popular Hedge Fund Shorts That Could Get Squeezed Next - AMD, ADI, CMG, DUK, GME - Dow Jones Newswire - Marketwatch
By Al Root 

The short squeeze that continues to send shares of GameStop higher has spread to other small capitalization stocks with high short interest. And while it would be more difficult for this kind of trading to spread to large capitalization stocks, there are some that share similar characteristics with those that popped. 

High short interest is, essentially, a high percentage of total shares available for trading borrowed and sold by bearish investors betting on price declines. It can exacerbate a stock's price rise in a short squeeze because investors like hedge funds, who for the most part are active short sellers, have to buy more shares to cover bets as losses mount. That's what happened when traders targeted GameStop (ticker: GME) and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY), whose short interest is far above the average short interest for stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average or S&amp;P 500. 

Goldman Sachs publishes a report that looks at the holdings of 814 hedge funds with $2.4 trillion of gross equity positions. As of the start of the fourth quarter 2020, the most recent report available, 10 of the stocks Goldman calls "very important short positions" for hedge funds with the highest short interest included: C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Aon (AON), Duke Energy (DUK), Analog Devices (ADI), Kroger (KR), Simon Property (SPG), Hormel Foods (HRL), Willis Towers Watson (WLTW) and Chipotle Mexican Grille (CMG).

Those are not small capitalization stocks like GameStop. GameStop is worth more than $24 billion as of Wednesday's closing price, but six months ago it was valued at less than $300 million. The average market cap of Goldman's group is about $44 billion. The least valuable company is Willis Towers Watson with a $26 billion market cap. 

The short interest in these 10 doesn't compare with stocks such as GameStop or Bed Bath and Beyond, either. The average percentage of stock available to trade sold short in the 10 stocks is about 7%. Short interest in Bed Bath and Beyond is about 67%. 

Lower short interest limits the potential for a big move. But there are rumblings of a squeeze. The average gain in the 10 VISP stocks over the past five trading days is about 1.2%. The S&amp;P 500 is down about 2.6% over the same span. 

If fallout from the GameStop squeeze continues, the impact could spread to those 10 stocks. Kroger and Hormel shares are already up more than others, by 17% and 13%, respectively, over the past five days. That's because losses piling up for hedge funds can cause them to sell long positions. It also means they may have to cover short positions, the trading action that is causing more intense short squeezes like GameStop's. 

Gains like GameStop are unlikely for those stocks. Still, nothing seems to be off the table these days.

Title: GME Squeeze explained by /u/P08C/ - some fundamentals for you retards
Hey all, posting on behalf of /u/p08c as his post keeps getting removed.

source: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7qahx/gme\_squeeze/gl87yyo?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7qahx/gme_squeeze/gl87yyo?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

 

Alright,  I'm fucking retarded and I suck at math, but I'll give you a long drawn  out post because I've got nothing better to do with my time.

First  let's take a look at the yahoo finance page for GME. According to the  statistics gamestop has 69.75M shares outstanding. That is how many  gamestop shares exist. Right below that you'll see that gamestop has  46.89M shares floating. That is how many shares are actually in  circulation and are "tradeable".

Now let's walk away from yahoo finance with those numbers in mind and go to  [https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today).  According to this website 97.68% of shares outstanding for GME are  being shorted. Since we know that GME has 69.75M shares and 97.68% are  shorted you can do the math and find that the total shorted shares for  GME is around 68.13M.

Now that we  know that there are 68.13M shares being shorted we can compare that  number to the 46.89M shares floating. Do some more math and you see that  68.13 is 145.297504798465% of the total 46.89M shares floating.

So  we come to the conclusion that 97.68% of the shares outstanding are  shorted or 145.3% of the float, the shares that are actively being  traded, is shorted.

Title: $10,000 is a realistic scenario. DD inside
GameStop closed at $197 yesterday at a market cap of $5.75 Billion. 
During the VW squeeze, VW became the largest company in the world. Currently, the largest company in the world is Apple with a market cap of 2,300 Billion (2.3 Trillion). 
For GME to beat AAPLs market cap, the stock would have to go 400x (2300 / 5.75). 400x growth puts the price at 197*400 = $78,800. 

$10,000 puts the market cap of GME at merely $291 billion (10,000/197 * 400) at the closing price point. 

Reaching $291 billion in the short squeeze is not even that unlikely. HOLD fellas! 

Disclaimer: not a financial advice.
Also, we like the stock

Title: The balance of power : retail vs hedge funds.
As we've seen yesterday, the financial system is slightly more complicated than it looks.

We buy a stock on our brokerage (webull, etrade, TDA, fidelity, charles...) and they process it for us with their clearing house and their exchange. Big boys like Fidelity do their clearing inhouse, while webull for example uses TDC. They put up the collateral for the risk and then it gets processed. 

The shutdown yesterday was due to clearing houses raising the collateral requirements due to high volatility, which itself is a result of the low liquidity.


Now how does a hedge fund do it's clearing? They use something that is called a "prime brokerage". The process is the same, there are just different requirements, as it is usual in the big boys club.

So if we were to pick a random Hedge Fund, like let's say Melvin Capital, how do they do their clearing? Who is their prime brokerage?

It's the very same people that brought the 2008 financial crisis to your doorstep: Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley. 

Those are the companies that hold the risk if Melvin goes under, they are the one that would margin call Melvin, if they were to ever margin call them.


This is of course no financial advise, but if I was Goldman, I would **pick up the phone and start dialling** to margin call gabe. 

because gme is going to the moon.

Title: Follow up to my NOK DD 
Please see my prior DD here: [NOK - THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPANY YOU'RE IGNORING ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4zy3d/nok_the_most_important_company_youre_ignoring/)

Today we have a new article from [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-28/gamestop-may-be-a-reddit-wallstreetbets-game-but-nokia-sure-isn-t). The author does an excellent job highlighting why Nokia is a compelling story (while haphazardly attempting to disparage the many thoughtful investors that reside here on WSB). Here are some of the pertinent points that I think are interesting and support some of the DD posted by others:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*neither GameStops video game stores nor AMCs cinemas are, in any real sense, systemically important. The telecoms networks that Nokia builds, however, are.* 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*because security concerns about China are* [*cutting Huawei out of markets*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-30/u-k-unveils-5g-plan-banning-huawei-installations-from-september?sref=oVpPkljO) *like the U.S., U.K. and France, those countries are increasingly dependent on just Nokia and Ericsson.*

Disclosure: I am long 500 calls of NOK. None of this is financial advice.

Title: Why GME dipped yesterday and why Holding the line matters more than ever.
Hello dear autists (and some new joiners who are about to hop on the train),

This is an unprecedented moment in Financial history. The establishment is balls deep in each others' arses and we saw that in the Citadel-Robinhood-Point72-StevenCohen collusion yesterday.

For those who missed what happened: Robinhood and other brokerage platforms coordinated a short attack on the retail investor by blocking buy orders and allowing only sell orders. This resulted in a near evaporation of buying volume and panic selling from a lot of understandably concerned stock holders.

It can be construed that this was happening on the orders of the great Citadel, who may have profited off opening short positions at the top. This was seen and caught by multiple order flow traders who noticed block trades. 

*A short ladder*

A short ladder was initiated. They closed the gates to retail and then block sold orders in the open market to drive down the prices. They did this between hedge funds A, B and C to maintain positions while profiting off their short positions (initiated at ATH). This can also be cross checked by looking at yesterday's volume, which was truly minimal. These HFs engineered the short ladder to use the low price to cover their short positions for cheap. Yet, the short interest dipped only marginally (from 140 percent to 120 percent) 

The idea was to have retail offload as many shares as possible to increase float, which will make covering the short positions easy. So now we know that this is what they want. They want us to sell. And they will try a variety of tricks to make us sell. The short ladder was one of those. 

So what can we do? And how will it matter? 

We do the opposite of what they want us to. We don't sell. How will this help the short squeeze? 

Not selling (and letting the buyers pile in) will add to the buying pressure. It will also reduce float. 

So when the shorts do choose to cover, they will need to buy again, and again, and again to cover their entire position.

So hear me out here let's do some quick math. Short interest (no of shares shorted/ no of available in float) = 120 percent. There are more shares shorted than exist to be bought. 

Investors like Burry and Cohen further reduce this float by piling in. In reality, the short is a good multiple of the float (this is my hunch). We have caught them by the balls and have a chance of changing the status quo. 

All you have to do is Hold and not increase the share float. Shorting Gamestop is becoming more expensive by the minute. The shorters need to pay their brokers margin to borrow shares too. By reducing float, we can make these HFs bleed more. 

By holding the line, we make HFs taste blood.

Title: The age of silver. And clandestine inflation.
You're all front row to the Fed money printing show and have seen them brrrrrrr wallstreet back to glory while everyone is suffering and starving. Businesses are closing .. People are dieing. All while inflation is mysteriously just not happening.

Hypothetical thought experiment below:

IF 300,000 people were each to buy 300 oz of physical silver ($8,400) = 90 million oz. 

90 million oz = 2,812 metric tons.

That is roughly the amount JPMorgan stores in their COMEX vault.

Title: This is no longer about shorting a struggling company. It's not more about getting a quick buck from a short squeeze and it's only partly about sending a message. It's about something much more important.
 Yesterday I thought about cashing out. In my GME YOLO post [Maxed out my credit and account to buy 205.31 shares @ 41.50$ (4200+1200+1000+500)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l45idy/gme_yolo_i_maxed_out_my_credit_card_and_my/) I wrote

&gt;But rest assured I've a safety net @ 420.69$; I'm selling 15 shares.

I've taken out the sell limit hours before market opening since I saw it was already taken off. When I wrote about the 420.69$ safety net 5 days ago it was still a meme price. Some started to believing in it. But many wasn't sure about it. So many things happened and I didn't thought we would be here at this point of time so fast. When we talked about making history we didn't really understand what kind of waves it will creating. Bluntly market manipulation for everyone to see? NO I knew we will write history but we are at a point where history write about us. They will write about us like that's our fucking backstory and how we ended up at the top of different industries. When people ask about you and you start with "everything started when I joined a subreddit called wallstreetbets..." they will just nod or look at you with envy and astonishment.

I thought about selling 12 shares to cover my debts. Was it because I was greedy? Maybe? But the more shit MM did the more this turned from making a killing to sending a message. Then they fucking did it, market manipulation openly, blatantly and making it look like they want to protect us.

But fair enough the definitely protecting us. Protecting us from making millions or billions and than needed to pay for taxes. But... but... the hedge fonds uwu? We can't buy shares u\_u! We will lose money v.v That's the point fucking donkey. Maybe you shouldn't sell naked shorts you greedy fuck.

I could have sold my shares for 200 a shares and would still getting a +375% return but this is not more about money and it's not entirely about sending a message. It's about a person. A person I care the most even though I make fun about him every day every hour. There are so many bad things about him. I constantly remind him about his life mistakes. Say what a fucking retard he is even though he got nice gains and only missed out of more. You probably already know about who I speak. I speak about myself. Of course I care about my family and love my friends but how can I be a good friend or a loved family member when I not putting my well being physical and psychological first? Some may thinks it's contradict speaking of well being but taking a debt for literally gambling. But this is not about money anymore. I can pay this dept by working 1 or 2 years easily I'm still young without responsibility.

This right now is my fucking development arc! I'm fighting for the things I believe with all I could put together. This is the time where I define my core values the things I stand for, the things I won't negotiate. Normally it takes years or extra amount of money to form this core values but right now I get a fucking crash curse how not to be a limp paper hand dick. I GETTING FUCKED PAID FOR MY DEVELOPMENT ARC. I learned more about the market than I ever did in school. I realized that money can be obtained without being a slave. I saw my money rising daily in monthly incomes.

And finally I really understand what "[the game was rigged from the start](https://youtu.be/BxOiVxTB0KY?t=223)" means.

I could cash out at 400$ on market opening and could go home with an amount of money I never had on my bank account. But this is already not more about shorting a struggling company, getting a quick buck from a short squeeze, sending a message or a fucking development arc I tell my wife next boyfriend about. No it's about everyone who is still holding. It's about [u/deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/deepfuckingvalue/). It's about the people who put their life savings into it. It's about people who got fucked in 2008. It's about the people who took a loan to buy the stonks. It's about people who get the operation for they loved ones. It's about people like me who already are poor. It's about the retards who joined this sub just to buy 1 share. It's about people!

So I'm here standing befor the hedgefounds and scream so loud that my spit will hit them

Title: GOLD &amp; SILVER ARE THE BEST WAY TO STICK IT TO WALL STREET
The Fed has printed trillions of dollars and yet all the average American has received (lately) is a measly $600 check. Where did the rest of that money go? **It went to Wall Street.** Money printing has made the wealthy substantially wealthier by inflating asset prices meanwhile wage slaves see their wages stay stagnant. The only hope for the legions of unemployed Autists is to somehow participate in the asset price inflation. $GME was an example of this and they did NOT like it.

That money printing favors the wealthy is well understood by those in power both at the Fed, in Washington, and on Wall Street. They know that they can continue to do it so long as three things persist:

1. The dollar maintains dominance as the global reserve currency. This can only happen if dollar inflation stays very low.
2. the American people continue to gleefully accept their pathetic stimulus checks and use them to buy goods and services (NOT ASSETS).
3. Banks artificially maintain low inflation by artificially suppressing commodities prices such as silver, gold, oil, corn, soybeans, and yes, butt con. If you think $GME was a crowded short position by hedge funds, this is the most crowded short position of all.

Driving commodities prices higher will drive inflation higher, and driving inflation higher will put an end to the profligate money printing. Everything Wall Street does depends on easy credit from the Fed. Anytime their positions go wrong they can easily tap into more credit (dollars). Their house of cards cannot persist unless the dollar holds its value and the Fed maintains their policy of easy credit and low interest rates. Once the inflation begins, the Fed has no choice but to pullback their lending. Only those with holdings in real assets will be protected from the inflation, and Wall Street knows there aren't enough real assets to go around to cover their debts. They were able to shut down buying of $GME but they won't be able to prevent the buying of gold and silver. It will be a modern day run on the bank.

**Our next move must be to collectively start buying gold and silver.** $SIL and $GDX provide exposure to gold and silver equities. $GDX is liquid enough to have plenty of options available. $SLV and $GLD provide exposure to the direct commodities through an ETF. An account on [Forex.com](https://forex.com/) will provide access to trading gold and silver spot prices. A futures trading brokerage account would be the ideal way of tapping into gold and silver futures directly. That way, you are actually entitled to physical gold and silver. Plus, there's considerable margin (leverage). Lastly, there are few European and Asian listed ETFs in the precious metals space, so those folks may have to utilize mutual funds. Lastly, consider getting some physical ownership. Might be good to have if Wall Street tries to fight back by closing brokerages. Best of luck.

Title: GME DD : When and how will a Gamma squeeze be triggered. Friday Jan 29
&amp;#x200B;

Gamma hedging happens in this case  when a trader has exposure to a call option close to the money (when stock price reaches the option strike price) since that is where a change in the stock price will have the largest influence on the option price (Delta) and each change in stock price will influence how fast the option price changes (Gamma).  A trader hedges Gamma so they don't have to continually monitor their Delta and hedge for every small movement of the stock.

My assumption (and it is a common one) is that most of the option volume we saw yesterday happened at market close (in part due to retail investor suppression) as that is how financial institutions trade.

Market closed at around $200, then rose to $300, and again to $350.

The question is: HOW DOES THE NUMBER OF CONTRACTS EXISTING (open interest) CORRELATE TO PRICE MOVEMENT DUE TO HEDGING?

Looking at the first option chain, we see about 10k option sitting at $200 which were certainly traded at market close, and at that moment, people need to hedge. Open interest is how many contracts exist, volume is how often they change hands.

Due to volume and demand, price rose to $300. That again triggered those 10K contracts sitting around $300 and led to hedging. The impact is not abrupt as when the market is open because of lower volatility.

The last image shows what could happen today after the market opens. It is currently at $380 (2h30min before market open). If the market opens at this price, and people buy enough contracts around the $380/$400 mark, it will push for the creation of more contracts (open interest) as demand=supply. We're currently at 2700 contracts, with 7000 more, it will trigger another gamma squeeze and push the price to almost $400 (because of course no one is selling their GME options).

&amp;#x200B;

Same thing happens again and we get to &amp;K options at $500 and virtually all existing call options will be printing tendies.

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer: I worked in the financial industry, I trade on an amateur fund with buddies and our strategy isn't very yolo (we sell puts) but yesterday we made $7K selling call options when retail brokerages weren't allowing to buy. We closed our position and hopefully one of the hedge funds were on the other side of the trade.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Most option activity happened at market close. After market, traders had to Gamma hedge their positions for the calls at $200 which drove the price up to $300. Same at $300

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/nc57xm6rc9e61.png?width=1101&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=859f7ef980caef44e3f0f4700a5eb98c252058b3)

Gamma hedges happen when traders need to hedge at the money options expiring in the next couple days. It seems 10,000 contracts ATM is enough to trigger a price rise of $100 

*Processing img chv68l6rc9e61...*

if we reach 10k open interest (if you buy people will add more contracts) around the $400 mark (where market could open) it will trigger a rise to $500 and again 10k contracts...

Title: You thought that GME was the biggest short squeeze? Wait till you see what's happening in the silver market
I'll try to keep this DD straight to the point.

Note: DO NOT SELL YOUR GME TO BUY SLV. AFTER THE SHORTS WILL BE SQUEEZED THEN MKVE YOU TENDIES OVER SLV.

The real POS of the 08 crisis were investment banks. They were the ones selling CDO's and MBS's. They gave shitty loans without doing any checks, they fucked us with adjustable rate mortgages. They should pay more than the hedge funds.

Now the silver futures' market is the most rigged place on any financial market. Nobody is even trying to hide it anymore. You thought that GME 140% short float is a lot? What about 200% short on the  yearly silver mining output. Yes you heard that correctly, they are selling futures for a lot lower than the true price of silver is, and because of this they have to sell FUTURE silver production. Now I don't know the exact precentege but It's surely above more than a full year of silver production.

Now for the short squeeze.

Let's say you are citybank and you sold one future contract on silver at the price of 25$ per oz. Now let's say that price is approaching 40$ per oz. What will you do? 
Two options:
1)You would have to hedge your position by buying a future contract at a higher price so your losses will be limited to the diffrence between the price at which you sold the contract to the price at which you bought it back at a higher price.
2)You would hedge your contract by buying physical silver so you can cover your obligation to sell silver at the 25$ per oz price. You will once again lose the diffrence.

Both options will not only leave you with a loss to suffer but will also increase the price of silver even more which will force other banks to cover there position and so a cycle of prepetual covering will happen. That's the GAMMA squeeze.
Now multiply that one contract by thousands of other contracts held by big banks all over north america and europe.

The short squeeze will happen when the banks won't cover their asses by buying futures or physical. They would be forced to buy silver at whatever price the maket demands.

Add to all of that the fact that there is already a huge run up in all commodeties and extreme inflation, and you have the perfect recipe for the biggest shirt squeeze ever.

You could see the price if silver past 2000$ in just one month. Over 10x the current price. 1000% gain anyone?

QnA: 

How do I take part in this?

You take whatever money you didn't put in GME and you put it in GME. Than you take the gainz to SLV  and SIVR.
They will buy physical silver every time you buy 1 share. That will spike the price up and start the ball rolling.

When should I cash out?

When the price is 4,200.69 per oz.

We like the stock?

Silver is shiny.

What about gold? 

Gold is trading at 70 times the price if silver. Accourding to most geologists I reaserched the amount of silver still in the ground compared to gold is about 8-10 times.  Not 70.

Wait but if after riding silver to mars we will find silver there?

We will already be at mars and the shorts will already be squeezed.

Tl;DR: kill the hedgies with GME and then kill the banks with SLV.

Tl;dr2: SLV 21/2c @420.69

Title: GME SQUEEZE

SPREAD THE WORD

Credit to u/PsychoticC4rrot

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that youll see today!!!

They didnt exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold &gt; price goes down &gt; the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place &gt; price drops even more &gt; they keep doing that &gt; price drops lower every time &gt; but as long as we hold they werent able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you dont believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore dont sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! Im talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND  )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND  )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is "Days to Cover" or "Short Ratio" .

Official definition:

 Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted.  Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question.  A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

 imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.  Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called "Days to Cover"

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

                                  

Title: Black Swans Wreaking the Hedges...Again
Fellow retards, as you might or might not have realised is that the $GME saga has opened a huge pandora's box across various aspects of our society, politics, economy and finance. 

What is really fascinating, is this has been 'destined' (for the lack of a better word) to happen. WSB degenerates aren't to be blamed, for anything.

Let me introduce you to a super smart guy called [Nassim Nicholas Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb) (he has more brain wrinkles that all of this sub combined) who wrote at length about Black Swan events (Dr. Michael Burry seems to have some sort of an inate affinity towards finding these birds  just before they fuck-up the entire financial system)

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img srytp6n639e61...*

So Taleb criticized the risk management methods used by the finance industry and warned about financial crises, subsequently profiting from the late-2000s financial crisis (I wouldn't be surprised if he loaded up on $GME calls too LMAO). He advocates what he calls a "black swan robust" society, meaning a society that can withstand difficult-to-predict events. He proposes antifragility in systems, that is, an ability to benefit and grow from a certain class of random events, errors, and volatility as well as "convex tinkering" as a method of scientific discovery, **by which he means that decentralized experimentation outperforms directed research.** 

For you smooth-brains, this means that a WSB type set-up where research and experimentation is open sourced and done by millions of decentralized degenerates will always trump a hedge fund type set-up where this centralized and vertically directed (usually by the CIO or PM)

Here is Taleb's [recent tweet](https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1355044129592532992)

&gt;GME  
&gt;  
&gt;Not a single movement in Game Stop was an outlier, with a standard power law with tail index 1.8!  
&gt;  
&gt;Not a single one! 

*Processing img ztjooyr2u8e61...*

***So what does this mean?***

What this means is that **$GME's stock movement isnt as special as it seems to be**. Everyone (read CNBC - fuck you Wapner, Boomerberg, CNN and even the fucking hedge funds) were surprised, calling it irrational, devoid of any reason or logic. 

Question is why were they surprised? The answer is because hedge fund models couldnt forecast shit. **Their models are worthless trash and they have been proven wrong again and again.** 

This is exactly the same stupid lesson LTCM didn't learn in 1998 and Lehman in 2008. Hedge funds tried picking up pennies in front of a steamroller and got crushed, this time shorting companies into the ground. 

Taleb calls these 'thick tailed' events. Extreme events away from the centre of the distribution play a very large role. Black Swans are not "more frequent", they are more consequential. The fattest tail distribution has just one very large extreme deviation, rather than many departures from the norm.

This is the rationality of common people with a good tail risk detector ('your spidey sense'), compared to the ignorance of experts (read hedge funds, MMs and other Wall Street dementors). 

If we visibly incur tiny risk of ruin, but have a frequent exposure, the probability of what happened to $GME would have gone to 1 anyway...basically what can break and is irreversible will eventually break. Shorting 140% of $GME's float is exactly that.

[From Dr Burry's 2008 Letter to Investors](http://capitalalligator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/scion_1q_2008.pdf)

&gt;I have found markets to be anything but random, and I find many of the future events that are bound to be dismissed as random or explainable only in hindsight in fact can be foretold in time with the rhythm of history. If one does the work.

And foretold they did. u/deepfuckingvalue and Dr Burry's spidey sense were right all along and predicted this all the way from 2019. 

TL;DR You degenerates are not the problem, you are the solution. $GME 

Title: The hedge funds WILL lie on their short positions on GME today, it is their best interest to lie since the fine for misreporting is nothing compared to what they stand to lose. 500 shares @$38 
I'm not from the US, so this IS financial advice. 

Hedge fund Cormark was fined  ($800.000) by the SEC for reporting a short position as a long position, for over a year. 

[https://www.pressreader.com/canada/stockwatch-daily/20201223/281496458890372](https://www.pressreader.com/canada/stockwatch-daily/20201223/281496458890372)

There is hardly any downside to lying for these hedge funds.   
They stand to get a  fine, but if they correctly report their perhaps 300% short, they stand to go bankrupt. 

They have already shown that they are willing to stop at nothing to kill retail.  
When short reporting time comes, and the short percent is 50%, DON'T BELIEVE THE LIES!

I like the GME stock. I have $26k locked and loaded for the short ladder today.



Title: Something Similar Happened in 1907 only Triggered by a Failed Corner Attempt Instead of Short.
&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Panic\_of\_1907](https://preview.redd.it/o95l3pfcm8e61.png?width=290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18153dfc80e7b941bc38bb50536eb671c361ec15)

&amp;#x200B;

**The panic of 1907 / Knickerbocker Crisis**

"The panic was triggered by the failed attempt in October 1907 to corner the market on stock of the United Copper Company. When this bid failed, banks that had lent money to the cornering scheme suffered runs that later spread to affiliated banks and trusts, leading a week later to the downfall of the Knickerbocker Trust CompanyNew York City's third-largest trust. The collapse of the Knickerbocker spread fear throughout the city's trusts as regional banks withdrew reserves from New York City banks. Panic extended across the nation as vast numbers of people withdrew deposits from their regional banks. It is the 9th largest decline in U.S. stock market history."

**After the Dow dropped 50%, JP Morgan, one of the richest fuckers EVER and a sort of acting central bank at the time, had to give out loans to bail them all out.**

*Processing img 2z6bjdjpv8e61...*

**These brokers are Fucked folks.** Hedge funds are going under over this. **It's Checkmate.** Every fucking Working class human on the planet is united as one people right now and we literally beat them at their own game, that they set up themselves AND rigged to their own favor. They got out traded by a group that takes pride in their having extra chromosomes and couldn't bare the shame of defeat so they averaged down on a massive loser like fucking bums and we called their bluff. 

**The amount of buy at open orders from everyone and their wife's boyfriend is absolutely going to overwhelm GME tomorrow and they will eventually be forced (once again) into a position where they have to pay whatever price we fucking choose**...we all saw the thread posted where an order got filled at over $2k/sh just before brokers stopped accepting buy orders...Today's gamma squeeze is going to blast us past the moon at lightspeed straight to fucking Mars with Papa Elon.

Which brings me to the reason for this...Word has it these guys are having to liquidate massive longs in the market to cover margin calls...driving the general market prices down. I believe that this coupled with general hatred for wallstreet by the average Joe and the fact that **We Proved to the world that the common person can make money in the market without the elites managing it**...Will result is steadily increased selling on the general Market...GME continuing to moon no matter what due to the squeeze. **More than likely I am wrong on this because I am literally fucking retarded...there is a tiny chance I am right but off on the timing and too early, and an even less chance that I am right in both theory and timing.**

I am balls deep in GME and AMC nearly all of my liquid capital is invested in these two companies including my fucking IRA retirement fund...I pulled my last cash savings and depositing it today to load up with OTM SPY puts at open because I really think the general market will suffer from this. 

Positions: $37k in shares GME+AMC, AMC Jun '21 $2.5C + Jan '22 $5C, GME Apr '21 $320C, Various deep OTM GME puts to tail hedge

Adding SPY puts tomorrow with my last fucking dollar everything from FDs to LEAPS.

**TL;DR bears r fuk, bears traded bad, bears tanking market with bad decisions, liquidity crisis probable, market might drop as result, SPY puts good, not trading advice...you'll probably lose money if you follow, we like the stock, diamond hand gang member for life.**

Title: GME SHORT SQUEEZE INFO (NOT MYNE BUT POSTING FOR VISIBILITY)
 SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*.

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.**

WE LIKE THE STOCKKEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK5,000+ 

&amp;#x200B;

This is not financial advice im not an expert this is my opinion and heck its not even myne i just agree with this

Title: Sell your other stocks now!
In a rush to get cash to cover their positions and somehow get out of their fucked up trades, hedgefunds can and will sell other positions.

I'm assuming this could trigger a major dip for the whole market, once they start selling big positions to cover their asses.
Market as a whole is pretty uncertain anyway.

If another gammasqueeze hits today and actually triggers the short squeeze THEY HAVE TO GET OUT OR GO BUST with cash they don't have right now.

That will fuck up a lot of other stocks for sure, but propel GME TO FUCKING SUN AND BEYOND!

Title: HOW TO BUY MORE THAN 5 SHARES ON RobinHood (up to 1,000)
Go find an options chain pricing sheet that shows volume:

https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/options?moneyness=allRows&amp;expiration=2021-04-16-m&amp;view=stacked_ohl

Filter through all expirations, Sort by volume. Find the highest volume (to make sure orders go through w/o ridiculous spread)

(12c 4/16 as of now)

Now go through RH's options screen and BUY - CALL then switch the date and scroll down to that expiry.

Since these are deeply ITM they will cost just about the same as current price * 100.

For example if current price is $400 at open each contract will cost about $40,000 then you pay an additional &lt;strike price&gt; * 100 to exercise (in this case $1200) to exercise.

Now exercise the options and

# Boom you have up to 1,000 shares of GME 

(RH is limiting to 10 contracts)

I'm tired and need sleep. If anyone can make a video tutorial / screen cast that'd be great. Especially the exercise screen.

Title: Short early morning Update - GME German trading
As of 03:15 ET (09:15) German/Paris time, GME is up around 70% from yesterday's close. The price is around 270 / 326 USD. Volatility is hight, so price can change by the seconds while writing this. 

Usually, stock price, especially for smaller caps, sticks to future pricing and aligns with US pre-market trading once open. 

Also interesting, German broker Trade Republic has reversed the ban on trading GME. The firm said, restrictions were necessary to protect stability of trading systems, risk management and clients.

Title: Out of the loop? What's going on and what's going to happen, what you can do.
Alright kids, fellow retards, and wall street shills. I'm going agaisnt the grain here, but I'm a fellow looser dropping tens of keys for years with you guys.

**What's going on?**

[We won... kinda](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7f95j/ladies_and_gentlemen_we_got_them/). The short squeeze and gamma squeeze both happened. Yesterday market broke. Unfortunately the real winners are big players like [BlackRock, Vanguard](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/l6hm3b/they_are_now_claiming_the_wsb_of_hacking_this_is/gl1xjzh/?context=3).

To avoid it all going in flames Market Makers and then Clearing Houses (new things to learn for you I know) the real players just decided to excercise their contracts and require full deposits from their clients (the small fries like WebBull and Robinhood).

Have they not do that GME would be already orgiting Mars, not Moon. Fucking Mars. Wait no, fuck Mars, it'd be orbiting Pluto.

The problem is with the infinite squeeze is ... nothing is fucking infinite. Sure you can *say* that the potential for losses for shorts is infinite, except when you are over 100% of losses and you are a corporation, the worst that happens is you close the door, and say "fuck you sue me". You must understand that. We've liquidated few funds, we'll liquidate few more, but in the end there's simply not enough shares to go around.

**Ok. So what's going to happen?**

Next week price will go up. Definitely to the stratosphere(1000+), maybe to the Moon(5000+), unlikely to Mars (10k-20k).

Then the real players: Vanguards, BlackRock will start dumping mass amount of shares.

Now listen to this. Did you ever wonder how 130% short interest was created?

Alice has 1 share of GME. Bob comes and borrows a share, and then immidietly sells it to the Celine. Celine then lends it to Daniel, who then goes areound and immidietly sells it again to Edgar. Voila: 200% short interest out of 1 share with no naked short selling.

**BUT** it works the other way too. Short seller Bob, buys a share because he has to, swallows a loss, but you know what? now he has a share, a share that's going up, so he waits one day and sells it for a profit ... to short seller Daniel, who turns around and does the same thing. Unwinding two shorts.

It takes days to unwind those kind of trades, that's why this squeeze will take days if not weeks.

So should you  to win? You'd think that  [Red is You](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l75z1d/volkswagen_short_squeeze_from_2008_the_red_is_you/)  look numbers even match up! The problem is that GME is not going back to 200 or 300 at which you bought in. It's going back to 20-40 in few months (yea, yea, shitron, they are right the timing is just off, which is the same as being wrong).

Now the hedge funds will get liquidated, sooner or later, if not on GME then on the next meme stock. But they do not **only** short. They als ohave long positions, those positions will get liquidated - that's why APPL is selling off among other things. What does that mean?

Wide market selloff. Markets **will** go down, and those people that invest in APPL do have stop losses. The stop losses will trigger, market will go down more.

**Ok retard so what should I do**?

*You're playing casino with disposable money*?  till Mars

*You're here to support Vanguard (because their ETFs are RAD) and want to fuck the system?*  till Mars

*You are just here for the ride and memes*?  till Mars

*You are here because your Aunt gave you some pocket money*? 

*You are here because you got stimulus check and you're up more then 200%?* Sell enough to take out your initial investment then  till Moon

Title: Update from the Scientist who posted original NVAX DD: NVAX reports best efficacy to date against original COVID variant (95.6%) and remains massively undervalued 
For those who followed my NVAX posts over the last few months and stayed with the trade, congratulations. For those looking for a new trade, I will outline why NVAX is de-risked and remains enormously undervalued, even with the 26% pop since data was released today. **I will also explain the significance of the results and why the reduced efficacy against the SA variant is bad news for the world, but actually presents a huge opportunity for NVAX and moreso than any of the other vaccine makers**. For those who didnt read my previous posts, I worked in vaccine R&amp;D for several years and am currently a biomedical PhD candidate. 

&amp;#x200B;

 \-----------------------------------------------------------------------

***Tldr: Despite the confusing headlines, todays data confirm that NVAX has a highly effective vaccine on par with PFE/MRNA and will allow them to lock in the billions of dollars of existing supply deals. NVAX is uniquely positioned to benefit in the booster market because its the only vaccine that can be easily multiplexed and repetitively dosed and can be stored in standard refrigeration. There is still time to get in before the market digests this information and realizes that NVAX is tremendously undervalued with a market cap of $10.7B and is on the cusp of several billions of annual COVID vaccine revenue.*** 

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

# Headlines may have undersold the results, but make no mistake - NVAX has highest efficacy reported to date

Unlike trial results weve seen from Pfizer/Moderna, which were conducted in the US during summer/fall against the original COVID variants, Novavaxs two trials were conducted in the presence of the troubling UK and SA COVID variants. For those unaware, these variants have several mutations on the spike protein which have subtle, but important differences from the spike protein in the vaccines. 

We already knew that the ability of antibodies from people vaccinated with PFE/MRNA were less effective against the new variants, so differences in efficacy between variants were expected (2-fold less effective against UK variant, and 6-fold less effective against the SA variant).  As a result, the only way to compare results between MRNA/PFE/NVAX is to subset the data by each variant, otherwise its not an apples to apples comparison. When we subset the data, here are the results:

  

https://preview.redd.it/b2u6g4lwb7e61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b107fc15468cbc899f85fbccc7be6d7200a8ec18

**Against the original COVID variant which PFE/MRNA was tested against, NVAX has the highest** [reported](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-demonstrates-893-efficacy-uk-phase-3) **efficacy.** Yes, its a slight margin and yes this is a smaller subset of patients than for PFE/MRNA, but the data is the data and it matches what we expected based on pre-clinical and phase 1 immunogenicity data. The fact that NVAX had higher efficacy than PFE/MRNA against the same strain seems to be missed based on most of the headlines I've seen tonight which report the 90% number. Also note that NVAX had the highest proportion of participants &gt;65yrs old, with 27%, compared with PFE and MRNA, which had 21% and 24.8%, respectively. 

Not surprisingly, efficacy against the SA variant in non-HIV+ patients is significantly lower at 60%, but the vaccine will still be useful against that variant. Once again, the overall number including HIV+ patients is what seems to be getting reported which is not a reflection of the efficacy that we would expect in the general public. Note that the original benchmark from OWS was for a vaccine that was at least 50% effective so a vaccine with 60% efficacy isn't useless. The big question is the efficacy levels that the other vaccines will report against the SA variant. Well know soon enough, but as I explain later in the document, I suspect that other vaccines will have a more significant drop off in efficacy against the SA variant than NVAX. 

 

# NVAX stands to benefit most from boosters and updated vaccine formulations to cover new variants

The results against the UK and especially the SA variant have huge implications for vaccine makers and how countries around the world are going to manage this pandemic. If NVAX went from 95.6% -&gt; 85.6% -&gt; \~60% against the original, UK, and SA variants, respectively, then I expect to see similar, if not more significant drop-offs for other vaccine makers (see footnote at the end of the post for explanation). 

This is a big deal because it's expected that protection will drop off over time but if you start off with lower protection and lower neutralizing antibody titers at baseline, then youd expect to lose protective immunity even faster. I made the graph below to illustrate the concept (red line for SA strain crosses the threshold of protection sooner than the blue line for the original strain).

 

https://preview.redd.it/3z6mnc1oi7e61.png?width=371&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5f8e6030b1f7237ee43aeab7703be6ba6cdb597

So, what does this mean? First, boosters are going to be essential and vaccine makers are going to sell a lot more doses as a result. Second, vaccines will be updated to cover multiple variants, which will continue the virus evolves. We already knew that Pfizer and Moderna were working on new versions of their vaccine, and after NVAXs conference call today we know that NVAX is working on a bi-valent vaccine (i.e. a combination shot). 

The need for boosters and coverage against additional strains is a huge deal and favors NVAX significantly over MRNA/PFE/AZN/JNJ because its the only vaccine that can be so easily multiplexed and repetitively dosed:

1. Novavaxs existing vaccine has only 5ug of protein (millionths of a gram) and can add multiple additional strains without concerns over dose limiting toxicity. For instance, they could add an additional 4 strains and have only 25ug of protein, which is a dose evaluated during phase 1 trials that was found to be safe.
2. mRNA vaccines dont have this same luxury because there is an upper limit to how much mRNA can be included in a dose before toxicity becomes a problem. For instance, Moderna includes 100ug of mRNA in each shot and we already know that they discontinued their 250ug dose from Phase 1 due to toxicity. Theyre not going to be able to just add another 100ug of mRNA to cover another strain. This will be much more complex and may require separate shots for separate strains.
3. mRNA vaccines also have higher reactogenicity symptoms from subsequent injections. Note that theres a huge difference in symptoms between dose 1 and dose 2 for both MRNA and PFE. This will likely carry over for boosters and additional shot and could become limiting.
4. The adenoviral vector vaccines  AZN/JNJ  suffer from vector-mediated immunity, which makes additional doses problematic bc your immune system develops an immune response against the vector itself and significantly less DNA is transcribed into spike protein. Its unlikely that the adenoviral vectors will play a big role in the booster/additional strain market without some relatively complex and unattractive logistics (i.e. mixing Ad26 and Ad5 vectors).

**The need for boosters and for strain updates means that COVID vaccination isnt going to be a one-time event.** This is bad for the world, but this is a huge deal for NVAX bc revenue forecasts for 2022 and beyond will be significantly higher than the DCF models used to arrive at current price targets from JPM and Jefferies, both of which are over $200.

Although the need for updated vaccine formulations presents an opportunity for 2nd wave vaccine makers to become relevant (i.e. $ALT, $VXRT, $ARCT, $CVAC), it will be more challenging to recruit and conduct trials, creating a bit of a moat for NVAX and other 1st wave vaccine makers. There might be some interesting plays in that space, but NVAX remains best positioned at this point in time for future COVID vaccine revenues.

Another thing worth addressing is the fact that the speed by which the mRNA platforms can develop new candidates is very exaggerated. They have about a one month jump over NVAX's platform, which is time that's easily made up by the ease with which NVAX can be distributed due to standard refrigeration requirements. 

&amp;#x200B;

# NVAX's is significantly undervalued with a $10.8B market cap ($170/share)

I'm not a CFA and prefer to stick to the science, so I will reference the fact that multiple analysts had price targets north of $200 (Jefferies at $200 and JPM at $215) BEFORE considering the newly revealed importance of boosters and multivalent vaccine formulations which will add billions to annual revenue projections for 2022 and beyond. I suspect price targets will end up being much higher once the data and implications are digested and models are updated. These price targets were also before considering having best-in-class efficacy data against the original COVID variant.

For reference, consider some COVID vaccine competitors such as MRNA, BNTX, and CVAC, which have market caps of $63B, $26B, and $15B, respectively. Yes, their platforms are being given a higher multiple due to potential revenue for other indications, but NVAX successfully completed its phase 3 trial for their flu vaccine ($4B market) by demonstrating superiority versus existing best in class flu shot and have an advanced RSV vaccine candidate. Oh and they'll likely have a multi-valent COVID vaccine and annual booster revenue. 

Last but not least, it's important to emphasize how big of a deal it is that NVAX requires standard refrigeration and not the cold chain requirements of MRNA and particularly PFE. We tend to think the most about the US and EU, but a lot of the world cannot distribute vaccines with special temperature requirements.

&amp;#x200B;

# Upcoming catalysts

As mentioned above, I anticipate that well see a wave of analyst upgrades in the coming weeks.  I expect that well see a wave of new supply contracts with countries that dont yet have a secured supply of vaccine.

JNJ will be reporting data next week from their Phase 3 trial evaluating their 1-shot formulation. They had several sites in SA and I anticipate that theyll be reporting efficacy specific for the SA variant and I expect it to be low. The efficacy readout for JNJs 1-shot trial is based on protection at day 15 post injection and based on immunogenicity data published this month, Im expecting poor efficacy against the SA variant due to low NAb titers at day 15. I anticipate that poor results against the SA variant will act as a positive catalyst for NVAX as JNJ is viewed as an important competitor for NVAX due to also having standard refrigeration requirements. 

Another likely catalyst will be the revelation that UK data will be able to be used for US emergency use authorization. For reasons that I can't understand, the media has largely ignored the fact that UK data can and will be used to support US EUA and that the US trial is relevant for eventual full licensure in the US which is a status that no COVID vaccine will have for at least another year. I don't think this has been appreciated and I think it will serve as another catalyst.

Finally, well see efficacy data in the near future for PFE/MRNA against the UK and SA strains. Its possible that we see some of this data next week at conference that all are attending on February 2nd. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Positions

Currently have 1/29 $150c, $160c, and $170c with a handful of 2/19 calls and call spreads.

 After I dump the 1/29s tomorrow, I plan to buy a combo of shares and 2/19 call spreads to play the next wave of catalysts.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for your time 

\-------------------------------------------------------------

**Footnotes**

1. There are two reasons why I'm expecting to see bigger drop-offs for other vaccines against the SA strain compared with NVAX: 1) lower baseline efficacy in the case of AZN and likely JNJ and 2) lower baseline neutralizing antibody titers compared with NVAX  true for PFE/MRNA/JNJ/AZN. Yes, T cells are important and may be an important differentiator for the mRNA  vaccines, but efficacy numbers to date have correlated with neutralizing antibody titers. T cells cant prevent a virus particle from infecting a cell; they can only kill a cell once its infected (impt for disease prevention) whereas sufficiently high levels of neutralizing antibodies can prevent a virus particle from ever infecting a cell in the first place. One way or another, well have comparative data about

Title: Adam Smith told Citadel to get fucked 300 years ago
Of Stock Lent at Interest:

"The stock which is lent at interest is always considered as a capital by the lender. He expects that in due time it is to be restored to him, and that in the meantime the borrower is to pay him a certain annual rent for the use of it. The borrower may use it either as a capital, or as a stock reserved for immediate consumption. If he uses it as a capital, he employs it in the maintenance of productive labourers, who reproduce the value with a profit. He can, in this case, both restore the capital and pay the interest without alienating or encroaching upon any other source of revenue. If he uses it as a stock reserved for immediate consumption, he acts the part of a prodigal, and dissipates in the maintenance of the idle what was destined for the support of the industrious. He can, in this case, neither restore the capital nor pay the interest without either alienating or encroaching upon some other source of revenue, such as the property or the rent of land."

TLDR: Fuck you pay me

Title: The gamma squeeze that was promised
Not financial advice

Well it Thursday night and GME just had it its first down day in quite some time. All you new traders are probably down 50% shaking in your boots. Alas the institutions have tried to fuck and yet they are still about to get shafted. 

Whats happened today? the price was manipulated we suffered a short ladder attack and brokerages banned buying of shares. Even after all this less than 2 million shares were sold by you retards and you held. Safe to say Im proud of you. Your faith will be rewarded.

Whats going to happen tomorrow? Friday morning I expect premarket to rise and price to skyrocket following open. The reason for this is mainly pent up demand since no retail could buy today. There is also the factor of mass 0DTE options likely to be purchased, this will cause a gamma squeeze if it happens. This in addition to all the other formerly far OTM will be in the money tomorrow and Dealers will not be able to hedge fast enough. This will result in a gamma squeeze that I believe the magnitude of will put the stock 600+ easy tomorrow. If shorts cover it could be much higher, but either way we should have a good setup for Squeeze on Monday. 

Although there is a possibility in a desperate attempt to save their asses people will do anything to drive the price down. Some people would see jail as better then what they risk losing if GME breaks 600. Yesterday no one would have thought that Apex would stop letting people buy GME, but here we are be ever vigilant. 

TLDR GME 
Squeeze hasnt been sqooze, Expect a legendary gamma squeeze tomorrow.

I may write a DD on Expected price action Monday and Zero Liquidity possibility, just let me know if yall want that.

Title: $NIO and why its time to buy 
There is a quick and simple analysis for you all:

 EPS has grown a significant 84% since last year

 NIOs revenue grew by 56% since last year

 EV stocks are an incredibly popular buy &amp; hold 

 NIOs revenue, deliveries, and growth are all expected to grow significantly over the next few years as we shift to an all-electric age

 NIO has is financially healthy and able to meet its short-term obligations with a quick ratio of 2.33

 Current quick ratio in the industry is 1.37, so NIO is already 87% ahead of its peers

 NIO is currently a stable company making consistent progress, making it very unlikely for bankruptcy

 NIO is in a massive up-trend, currently consolidating in the 55-60 area making this an ideal buy the dip level

 NIOs current consolidation and lack of news coverage means that NIO is not high in the spotlight, this makes it ideal to buy because as soon as good news hits the market, the price will rise significantly. Its much better to buy now than the moment news comes out

 NIOs delivery numbers are accelerating exponentially

 Not everyone is quite convinced with EVs, so the moment they become more relevant or less risky in the coming years more investors will look to buy into EVs

 NIO rose a total of 1,100% in 2020 making it one of the fastest growing EV stocks in the market

 We have an incredibly strong zone of demand in the $50 area in NIO with loads of limit buy orders

 There is a small supply zone in the $64 and the $67 areas, as soon as we break past those we will soar past uranus 

Title: GME rational consideration from a professional investor
I know it feels like you guys have discovered a cheat code with option gamma squeeze and short squeezes. For those who got in at &lt;$50/share and made 10-50x on options. Congratulations.

I am not saying the populist anger isnt justified or that our system is not flawed or that these hedge funds didnt fuck up by shorting something with such a large short float. But sometimes its good to stay calm and analyze things rationally and consider the following opinions from someone who was burned by the short selling ban in 2008 and lost my shirt with my puts in 2012 betting on a cascading bank failure in European when Draghi announced LTRO. There are a lot of things that can go wrong with the infinite money machine thesis.

The more the price of GME rises, the likelihood that the SEC will institute a short term trading ban on the stock increases. But vegaseller, you say, we will just Hold and when it resumes  our infinite money wormhole will work again, time is on our side, the shorts have massive margins interests which are compounding.

The problem will be when a private deal is negotiated between GME management and a short seller consortium. It is highly likely there are already negotiations underway between some individual short sellers and the company on a private deal to issue new shares at a significant premium, although much lower than the current market price. Management will be happy to double the shares outstanding at anywhere from $20-100 shares/share, a considerably discount to the current share price. Their concerns are retiring their existing debts and generating cash on their balance sheet for a pivot rather than maintaining their current shares price.

And the higher the run-up in GME share price, the greater the incentive for short sellers to form a consortium and reach a private deals with management and the greater incentive for management to close a deal towards a higher price range. Once a deal is largely settled, they will loop the SEC in to institute a temporary trading halt on the stock. 

If this happens, you guys would be left holding the bag and the share price could easily drop to $10-$50.

There is no shame in taking some money out. Just here to point out how the shorts can still get out at a much lower cost than you think. Again its just food for thought, make your own judgement.
