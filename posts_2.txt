Title: PBW (Green Energy Sector ETF) and why you should buy long dated calls
I'm sick and tired of you retards shilling ICLN and TAN when there's a much better option that's being completely ignored and its literally free money. 100% can't go tits up. Anyways, here's some DD.

PBW is based on the WilderHill Clean Energy Index (Index). The Fund will normally invest at least 90% of its total assets in common stocks that comprise the Index. The Index is composed of stocks of companies that are publicly traded in the United States and engaged in the business of advancement of cleaner energy and conservation. The Fund and the Index are rebalanced and reconstituted quarterly.

[56 stocks. A blend of solar and electronic vehicle. It even holds some of our favorite meme stocks, which are highlighted.](https://preview.redd.it/234cad57sm861.png?width=1308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58d93fc72254ae81591278dc1ac6cc851301d7ad)

[PBW is in an uptrend and the energy sector had a big correction this week. Next week could be a good time to get in.](https://preview.redd.it/s406syyftm861.png?width=860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=209595abc3e848f64d7b7766e4ddd0816947279a)

*Processing img wj8kbxawsm861...*

So, here's why you should buy PBW over any other green energy ETF. 

1) It has exposure to both solar and EV. A lot of these green energy ETFs are only solar. They completely leave out EV, which is going to be massive. PBW gives you exposure to both parts of the sector, unlike many other ETFs.

2) It has memes and majority of the stocks are small cap. As mentioned, small caps make up 61.91% of the ETF and its got some meme stocks. Biden is going to become president in a month and he is all for green energy. These memes and small caps might see massive growth when Biden starts funding green energy and passing green energy policies. For this reason, I think the ETF may explode and its important to get in before Biden is president. I suspect the green energy sector will have a lot of momentum during Biden's term.

3) Invesco made this ETF. Sound familiar? They made QQQ. I think people will flock to this ETF in the future when everyone wants to jump into green energy, after Biden sets the sector on fire.

I'd suggest buying what I did, the longest dated calls. There is lots of talk about a market crash in the coming months, so you want to have time for PBW to recover if we do crash. I think the green energy sector is going to rally like crazy soon. **It has already gone up 203% in a year though.** You could argue it is overpriced, but I believe this is an emerging sector and has much more room to grow, especially with a president pumping the sector.

Title:  Bionano Genomic Biotech Going Parabolic
As you know, the Woman of the year Cathie Wood who called Tesla has pointed to Genome stocks  as the next tesla. In fact although her ARKQ which has tesla has seen gains, it has overshadowed her ARKG which has her biotech sciencey genomic etf. Year to date that portfolio has made super saiyan gains at 174% at the time of writing this.

Now in her ARKG the number one holding spot weighted at 6.8% is Pacific Bioscience. That stock has gone in 6 months almost 1000% (yes, i wrote that correctly you retards). $3-&gt; $26.

Now there is a company which claims to be able to do the same genomic technology (mapping of genomes, idk too smart for me, go look it up- can break down your DNA to see the profile) more efficiently in cost and accuracy. (BIONANO GENOMICS). If you google Bionano Genomics the last few days has been gaining traction because the stock has risen from ~0.60 to 1-2 dollars and as of market close 4 dollars. The main reason for this gain has been a study released a week ago from a group of nerds at the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium compared PACIFIC BIOSCIENCES and BIONANO absolutely curb stomped them

Vanguard also bought 5.5 million shares. And as you know, these are the stuck up nerds who your wife will marry after divorcing you as well as her boyfriend after you, will marry. These kids are the same kids who top post on r/investing and hate    and tendies. Theyd rather cash out when their penises are limp.

Now if this company gets FDA approval which they are trying to do since they hired a medical director 4 months ago to help them with this process. Dr. Alka Chaubey has helped another company pass FDA APPROVAL BEFORE. Bionano Sciences will go parabolic. And will probably see similar gains to Pacific Bio, while having a smaller market cap.

If you want a real DD video format since most of you can't read:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh-fIMc0-iY&amp;ab_channel=Deadnsyde

Fun fact, your wifes boyfriend already got some shares and since you are on the brink of losing her, this will be your only way to compensate for your small dong and win her back. The good ole 1 up.

LET US LEAVE 2020 BEHIND AND RIDE INTO VALHALLA AS THIS NEW MEME STONK TAKES US TO TENDIE TOWN          

TLDR: Biotech Company going parabolic, jump in before your wife leaves you.

Title: JUICY GME DD  + Reason behind ICR change
Alright earlier today I wrote an Erotica novel of DD, which was mainly a preface / foreplay to this. The idea was to be able to finish it all in one go, but I ran out of my supply...

All jokes aside, life came up and I thought I could finish it rather soon but that didnt happen. 

Many of you have an attention span that is longer than you could last in bed, so Ill just spill the DD here. I highly encourage you to go back to that post because Im trying to coordinate and a make a push for charities, donation ideas, and creating a social media push / trend to not only round up undiagnosed Autists out there, but to also to send batman signals to #TheDogFather Ryan Cohen.


The best news can be slaughtered by poor presentation. I have doubts with Sherman up there, perhaps theyll use someone effective. 

#DD points: 

1) GME is making a bigger push to becoming PC oriented, not just games and accessories, but parts as well. 

2) The reason Sherman was able to qualify GME as essential business was because of the few PC stuff they had. Then they sold out of that PC stuff in March and after that they were basically open because of PC qualification despite not having any PC items. By switching to technology category, Sherman would have to qualify them into that. The way he has been able to do so is for 2 reasons. 

A) To ensure that theyll stay open in similar lockdowns. This will probably not be mentioned...but the dude did push for his stores to remain open and got backlash for it. Already tarnished a damaged image. 

B) Change business model and get in that Tech Train.


3) OmniChannel experience. 

4) GME has signed contracts with about 6 vendors and providers a couple which were just recently. That number was a ball park # off the top of their mind. These include MSI, NewEgg and so on. 

5) You will be able to outright buy gaming PCs in stores and / or just order any part you may need. Theyve ran small trials for these and plan on rolling it out to stores at different times. Unfortunately not every store will have the same experience/ products based on demographic/ size...but they should still be able to order and ship to home or store pick up. 

6) Stores will have dedicated areas for PC experience. Ok lets be realistic, most stores are the size a studio...so the PC area will be a house for ants. 

But if you check out local GME stores and see empty display areas / locked glass with nothing in it, this is where it is probably going to be dedicated. 

7) Even if you buy $10 card with $5 certificate, youre not hurting GME. All those cards have been paid for before they got on the wall. Youre helping money come back, plus the goal is that people will spend more money. 

The goal from my 1st post with push of pro memberships wasnt to rely on the $15 or $20...and have that as the savior. 

The idea is that with more memberships, you have more leads, and you have people who are more likely to buy products from you. Youve now successfully pried someone from going a bigger retailer or online merchant. 

8) Buy memberships for other people. You can also buy memberships for business such as daycare / hospitals etc. At the very least they can have a physical magazine delivered on a monthly basis ($20 version) even if they never choose to use certificates. 

9) Pro Rewards:
#digital gamers benefit hugely. 
Remember those PSN / Steam etc cards, there is 40pts for every dollar spent on those as opposed to 20 pts on everything else.

Why does this matter? Faster points to redeem certificates for yourself or charities already affiliated with GME. 

Every 5k can be redeemed for $5 certificate or donated to charities. 

If you just recently signed up, you got 10K points already, plus welcome $5 coupon. Your 1st official $5 certificate will be available 1st of each month... so you may have up $20 available pretty soon...

10) GME now offers their own CC, which is available to use the same day. They also offer flex pay options from 2 different vendors who allow you to qualify from your phone and make payments ...GME isnt taking this risk, they get paid from the vendors, customer pays the vendor. 

They also have a rent to own program, with minimum of $120+. 

Final points:

Most customers are buying for other people, that isnt going to change. So while e-commerce is huge, some Karens will always need to show up to store...

But GME sells used games for nearly same price as new or more expensive than new games. They dont make this decision, they sign contracts that cant reduce price on these games until x amount of time...

But GME barely offers any $$$ for my product.

Hi there, they are a business, the most important thing for a business is to be in profit. 

##How long 1 minute is depends on which side of the bathroom door youre on...

Lets talk a quick lesson of value vs worth.

Your PSP might be worth $100 to you, but it only has a a value of $5 to GME. Why? Because for every 1 person that comes in looking for a PSP, they have 15 others trying to trade in. After they reach their limit of trade in, wtf are they going to do? Collect every PSP at the price you want them to? So thats part of why you get offered low prices.

Theres other things involved. They have bills to pay, electricity, rent, wages, medical benefits, legal fees, alarm / security, maintenance on commercial grade AC/ventilation and many more. Oh yea, they also provide people with a safe place to trade in without risking getting robbed, shot, or killed. 

When any business closes, its not just those employees who lose their job. The services that that business relies on (mentioned above) now lose a customer and revenue as well. There is less stores for that AC company to send people out to...which means less money for them, which leads to more lost jobs. 

And you know what caused it? That lazy bum who chose the comfort of purchasing from home from an online merchant etc. Theres much more to this and this is just the tip of the iceberg when people choose how you do business and shop. Theres pros and cons to everything. Im not saying never order online, but try to keep a balance. Support your local businesses when you can. 


TL;DR:

ICE changed to Tech because they are changing their ways, and going more PC oriented. Theyve signed contracts with vendors and providers. More focus to PC gaming, include actual gaming computers, and parts that can be ordered.

Title: GME to 420.69, but only if we make it happen. DD inside.
We all know the short volume far exceeds 100% of available shares of GME. A month back, a post revealed WSB holds over 5-6% of TOTAL available shares. When the shorts have to cover, they need available shares to cover. If no one sells, moon shot right? Not exactly. 

On large moves, people will cash out along the way, keeping the price down. The fewer people that sell, the higher the price is forced until the orders are filled. So how do we get it to the moon? Set an order to sell ALL your GME shares (no expiration) at $420.69. Set it and forget it. When Cohen and Co. refuse to sell, and diamond hand endure, there won't be enough shares to cover the shorts. If the majority of the available shares are at $420.69, Melvin Capital will be forced to bow to the autistic strength of WSB.

Happy New Year, let's retire in 2021.

Title: Reply to "NIO will miss 4Q delivery guidance"
This is in reply to u/m3equals333 **-** Where he predicts that NIO will miss guidance next week.

As we know, NIO has set 4Q guidance at 16,500 - 17,000 cars. There's currently a cumulative 4Q output of 10346, meaning NIO needs to produce 6154 - 6654 cars this month to meet this guidance. 

The article below suggests that NIO has started double shifts and that the company is on track to reach in January a monthly production goal of 7,500 vehicles - "Stepped up output by 50% to 30 SUVs per hour starting this month".

**Thesis 1:** In 2021, Salesforce will use slack as a major integration tool to marry internal conversations and workflows with automation. 

Slacks customer base (start-ups and small to medium size businesses) may adopt the Salesforce CRM platform.  

**Catalyst 1:** By putting Slack in the middle of business processes, you can begin to eliminate friction that occurs in complex enterprise software like Salesforce. Instead of moving stuff through email, clicking a link, opening a browser, signing in and then finally accessing the tool you want, the approval could be built into a single Slack message. 

If you look at what people are doing with the Slack platform, its essentially incorporating workflows and bots and all these things. The combination of the Salesforce platform where I think we have the best automation intelligence capabilities with the Slack platform is incredible, Taylor said.

### Assuming that Covid and new mutations will be the new norm. 

**Thesis 2:** In 2021, as Covid vaccine deliveries ramp up, more and more hospitals and local governments will adopt the Salesforce platform and the Salesforce Health Cloud to help schedule vaccination appointments and manage their COVID-19 vaccine programs, including vaccine inventory management and administration, notifications, outcome monitoring, and more.

**Catalyst 2:** More than 15 international, federal, state, and local agencies, including the State of New Hampshire and the City of Chicago, use the Salesforce Platform and Work.com for Vaccine distribution.

# Quarterly Report - Dec 4, 2020 Breakdown (10k SEC Filing)

## Earnings:

*Bullish Statements*

Our professional services and other gross margin was break-even and positive $15 million during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, and positive $10 million and $27 million during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019, respectively.

Earnings per Share: Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.15 as compared to a loss per share of $0.12 from a year ago. Third quarter diluted earnings per share benefited by an unrealized gain of $1.1 billion associated with the initial public offering of one of our strategic investments.

## Revenue from Product: 

*Bearish Statements*

For the nine months ended October 31, 2020, the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase of $276 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $37 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $220 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, and an increase of amortization of purchased intangible assets of $214 million.

*Bullish Statements*

As a result of the financial impacts of COVID-19 we experienced during the nine months ended October 31, 2020 and our current assumptions related to the extent to which the pandemic will affect our business going forward, we expect modest growth in our new incremental business and renewals, total revenues, remaining performance obligation and operating cash flows for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.

Revenue: Total third quarter revenue was $5.4 billion, an increase of 20 percent year-over-year.

The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our services, our focus on marketing our services internationally and investment in additional international resources.

Revenues in the Americas and Europe also benefited from our acquisition of Tableau in August 2019

Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 13 percent since October 31, 2019, primarily attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base.

In August 2020, Salesforce was recognized by the Climate Group and RE100 as Best Policy Influencer for our efforts in calling for a federal price on carbon, supporting new emissions standards in the state of Virginia, and signing the largest ever UN-backed CEO-led climate advocacy effort to urge governments to incorporate climate action in their economic recovery plans.

We also plan to continue to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. As part of our business and growth strategy, we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories, including analytics and integration. We drive innovation organically and, to a lesser extent, through acquisitions, such as our recent acquisition of Vlocity in June 2020 and our pending acquisition of Slack Technologies, Inc. (Slack), which was signed in December 2020 and is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2022.

Pricing was not a significant driver of the increase in revenues for the period.

Marketing and sales expenses make up the majority of our operating expenses and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses and commissions, for our sales and marketing staff, as well as payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead.

## Cashflow

*Bearish Statements*

Our operating cash flows were negatively impacted by investments made in our go-to-market efforts, such as the partial minimum commission guarantee provided in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.

In fiscal 2021, changes in billing frequency for new business and investments in our go-to-market efforts resulted in a negative impact to our operating cash flows during the quarter.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant global economic uncertainty, adversely impacted the business of our customers and partners, impacted our business and results of operations and could further impact our results of operations and our cash flows in the future.

## Debt

*Bullish Statements*

We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided by operating activities, unbilled amounts related to contracted non-cancelable subscription agreements, which is not reflected on the balance sheet, and, if necessary, our borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months.

We may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Credit Facility for refinancing other indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions.

## Slack Acquisition News (various reputable tech and news sites).

Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield: As software plays a more and more critical role in the performance of every organization, we share a vision of reduced complexity, increased power and flexibility, and ultimately a greater degree of alignment and organizational agility. Personally, I believe this is the most strategic combination in the history of software, and I cant wait to get going.

 The company had lost nearly half of its market value since going public in April 2019, and it failed to turn a profit during its last three quarters despite the surge in remote work due to COVID-19

The company did not have an obvious path to becoming profitable and no clear way to overcome increasing pressure from Microsoft Teams, making a potential acquisition more likely with each passing quarter.

From the Salesforce perspective, Taylor says that the Slack deal was worth the money because it really allows his company to bring together all the pieces of their platform, one that has expanded over the years from pure CRM to include marketing, customer service, data visualization, workflow and more.

...by putting Slack in the middle of business processes, you can begin to eliminate friction that occurs in complex enterprise software like Salesforce. Instead of moving stuff through email, clicking a link, opening a browser, signing in and then finally accessing the tool you want, the approval could be built into a single Slack message.

When you think about automation, its event driven, these long-running processes, automations. If you look at what people are doing with the Slack platform, its essentially incorporating workflows and bots and all these things. The combination of the Salesforce platform where I think we have the best automation intelligence capabilities with the Slack platform is incredible, Taylor said.

### 12/9

Slack Technologies Inc (NYSE:WORK) has inked a definitive agreement to be acquired by customer relationship management behemoth Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).

The transaction is likely to receive the required stockholder and regulatory approvals, and another offer is unlikely to emerge, according to Morgan Stanley.

The Slack Technologies Analyst: Keith Weiss upgraded Slack Technologies from Underweight to Equal Weight and raised the price target from $27 to $44.

The Slack Technologies Thesis: The cash-and-stock deal implies the companys shares are worth $44.47 each, representing an equity value of more than $27 billion and enterprise value of around $26 billion, Weiss said in the upgrade note.

Management expects the deal to close in the quarter ending July 31, 2021.

Given the premium on a growth adjusted basis, we see this as a full valuation for Slack, and therefore don't expect anyone to go over the top, especially considering the limited potential buyers given a deal this large, the analyst said. 

Earlier this month, Slack Technologies released strong quarterly results, with revenues, billings and margins ahead of the consensus estimates, he said.

There are plenty of  to keep your attention. This will be long. This will be epic. It even includes a physics lesson and how GME is in a physics equation, validating Valhalla. 

Just as reminder, most of you should have possibly received your first welcome $5 certificate from GME. Your first months Certificates will be available at the beginning of calendar month. So by tomorrow you should have $10 incentive to make it rain at GME. (You can end up with $75 in certificates in the 12 month period)


Since people are lurking and keeping tabs on us, let me have your full attention with this. 

Ryan is Vito Corleone and Mel is Don Ciccio. More on this later, but just in case you are clueless, here is a little [preview.](https://youtu.be/gCdXiOssbM0)

GME didnt take me seriously. I contacted HQ, the HR department specifically. I said I would like to get on board with GME and that Im responsible for a massive spike in their memberships. The guy was dumbfounded of my request to look into Pro Membership numbers and said he would email others to look into it and they may contact me...then he suggested that I should still apply for positions at GME....when I said I want to be on board, I literally meant the board....but Ill be willing to start off as a district manager or in marketing. 

Now its been a few days, and I know its right before New Years, but Sherman has yet to contact me. Then again, he doesnt even have twitter, showing how old school he is. 

3) I will need your input for additional # 



#Official Start of the Post

WSB is what GME is to the general public. Just like GME, most people dont understand WSB and have a negative view on us. They hear rumors, see glimpses and glorified headlines and make their opinion on WSB. 

Are we perfect? Hell no. Are we saints? Absolutely not. Do we have some bad apples who are cringeworthy that even we at WSB despise? Absolutely! WSB isnt for soft  and the faint of heart individuals who take things at face value. 

The truth is, just like GME, there is a lot of positives to us, but not everyone notices that and looks at both GME and WSB as pure evil. **Many are betting against GME and WSB.** Unfortunately for them, both are here to stay, and will become a greater presence as time goes on. 


Have you ever beat it up so good that months later  they contacted you back for a repeat? Well you havent, but your wife can attest to this experience.

**The axe forgets what the tree remembers.**

Before I lose you since this will be a lengthy post with lofty goals of charity and coordinated social media presence...

GME 


This is an attempt to coordinate our efforts and become a more powerful force to be reckoned with. 

##Speaking of Force, even Physics validates GME 

You see there is an equation for Newtons Law of Universal Gravitation. The law is that objects with greater masses have a greater (attraction) gravitational force. The attractive force is directly related to the mass of the objects, and inversely related to the distance between them. 

The more massive the objects, the greater the force. The greater the distance, the less of the force. Want proof? Have you ever seen any chicks on my 600 lb life who is single? They all have a partner. Have you seen the 1000 lb sisters? One of them is currently pregnant. That means that someone, possibly one of you, managed to get her pregnant. 

The law validates itself, the more massive you are, the more attractive you become. GME has been a massive target for shorts, it has been and will remain a huge attraction to shorts and bears. 

GME is so attractive, that Mel left GME for dead. They couldve closed positions, they werent satisfied at $4. They want GME bankrupt. 

Don Ciccio was enough to order Vito to be killed when he was 9, but his foot soldiers werent the best. In fact, when Vitos mom begged Don Ciccio to spare Vito who is dumb-witted and only 9 years old after having killed her husband and her oldest son who has vowed revenge; Don Ciccio responded when he becomes bigger, he will come for revenge and kill me. 

So calling Mel Don Ciccio is an insult because Don Ciccio was wise to attempt to tie up loose ends, but the fate is the same. 

Back to Physics: The law and equation...

The equation (for Earth) is:

#F = GMeM / Re^2

##Can you believe this???

We all know what Re means...but if they are scattered and too far from each other, the force is not as great. This is why we have to recruit and bring all the scattered individuals to join the cause. The closer the distance of Re, the greater the force. 



With that said, not all forces are evil, and we will be benefiting many great causes. 

We are the leading sub in gifting awards, by a landslide, and thats not even coordinated. Imagine if we did actually start to coordinate for our goals. 

FFS, **we may have set the record of most awards given to a post** for a post that said to buy shares instead of awards. 

People are aware of us....but they dont take us seriously. They notice us, they lurk for their headlines and etc, but they dont see the true power behind us. Every now and then, they may acknowledge or refer to us, but the reality is, it is always in a negative way. In fact, thats ok. We dont want to give the illusion that we do charities and donations to improve our image. We are not like the powerful and famous people who do things for PR purposes. We are just your regular individuals who have a more giving heart then the people who look down upon us. 

Many people here have individually donated to charities and towards great causes, for genuine reasons, and that is far more valuable than those who donate for pure PR. 

##Back to the tree and axe saying:

The tree is Mel, old, ancient, and deeply rooted in their beliefs. While trees are beneficial, this one is rotten and is experiencing heart rot. On top of this, there are many termites planning on feasting (smaller position shorts and bears.) We are not going to eradicate them, we are going to hit them twice. Theyll call the first one a fluke, contribute it to new console releases, and pure luck of WSB. 

But at some point, in order to realize gains, we will have to sell. Eventually time will pass, GME will be lower than its peak values because of the inevitable squeeze, and some unfortunate souls will be FOMOing at the top and be left bag holding. These bags will be so big and heavy that not even Southwest Airlines will let them fly for free. 

The likes of Mel, boomer analysts, and bears will rise again and claim that it is going back to the 5 year trend. Theyll be setting themselves up for a 2nd round...But by this time

##TheDogFather Cohen has taken over GME 

and laid the foundations of successful business that will help GME transition and thrive. 


GME has consolidated and weve kept it above $19.
But no one is taking us seriously. There was an obvious attack that made the Uptick Rule go into effect this week, and many expected today to be the dip. We here at WSB dont have   TP hands, but there are others who do. Those individuals are not aware of us and are easily manipulated. We should educate them, harden them up and have them join the cause.

Just like how many of you and the public werent aware of the memberships, many people (outside of here) arent aware of the strategy. Or if they are, they may not understand what to do and what not to do...ie during uptick rule times and not using margins etc. 

We also want to quickly spread solid info. Some of you posted my post on stock twits and noticed other people talking about it. Thank you for that, we made a reach, but we need to make it bigger. 

This is where my new info and DD will come into play, and many others as well. 

The reality is, many people (consumers and investors are still having the stereotypical view of GME. These stereotypes are leading to a downfall and an uphill battle. 

Getting the word out and educating people is the best thing to do, not just for GME, but for all business. 

There are valuable lessons to learn from BlockBuster and TRU, which I will get to. 

##At this point I have to take a break, will update soon with the rest of the post.

There will be more information about GME, benefits, and how things work as I edit this post and add it. 

#Ill edit this post and update.

Why am I posting something incomplete?

1) Im a human, I have to take care of somethings and come back and finish

2) Youre a human and you need the break. 

3) Gather interest in this post as reaching the hot posts takes time...unless youre the guy who posted about not spending money on awards. Ive never laughed harder from a title alone (and seeing the bukkake of awards on that post). 


#You can redeem 5k points for an additional $5 certificate or donate to the current charities GME is affiliated with. 

We can also come up with our indirect donation / charity. One of my ideas was is that we can organize a program with hospitals. 

We can buy memberships under fake names or possibly 

#Ryan Chewy

And use the phone number of a local childrens hospital. This bit of info can be shared with that hospital, and they can use the certificates to purchase little toys etc. Obviously the hospital would need to use their own funds to cover the remaining balance, but perhaps they already have such budget, or maybe they can set up and we can donate here and there. 

At the very least, they can get a physical copy of the magazine (assuming you signed up for $20)...but since its COVID, the magazine cant really be shared...so maybe digital is better.

These are just random ideas, if we combine all of our low IQs, we can come up with some good benefit drive ideas etc.

Title: DD on Tesla Spreads: Triple your stake by end of 2021 if you're still bullish on this shit company (srs)
I love Memelon but I hate Tesla (and yes I'm salty I didn't buy in advance). Tesla cars are shit and they're marketed to retards who think the steering wheel falling off is normal. Autonomous driving can't detect a firetruck standing in the middle of the road. The stock is more overinflated than the Venezuelan bolivar. But you don't have to take this from me. If you still believe in the garbage that is TSLA valued at &gt;$700, here's what you can do to prove me wrong.

At the time I'm writing this TSLA 1/21/2022 calls are valued roughly $3.50 apart for $690c and $700c. For example 690c = $195.75 and 700c = $192.25. The call prices go up and down but the difference remains in the neighborhood of $3.50 per. You can tap and hold (buy call -&gt; hold 690c -&gt; switch to sell call -&gt; hold 700c -&gt; put in your price for the 690 debit spread) to buy both at the same time because like you I don't have 19k to temporarily hold while I leg into a trade.

Buy 690c and sell 700c.

The spread costs $3.50 and if the stock finishes above $700 - doesn't have to keep climbing, just has to stay where it is today - you get 286% of your money back. If Elon splits the stock your option strikes also split, so if he does what he did last time you won't be gypped out of your money. And all you have to do is sit on your hands for a year and hope for no crash.

If you're a bear you only get 30-50% max return on the opposite side of this trade AND you have to get tabbed on by TSLA fans if you lose which is even worse than the fiscal L. But if you think Tesla is seriously worth $700 then put some money into this and dab on me from your disintegrating Model 3.

Title: A clever post-SPAC cannabis play $CLVR
Tanking over the past week which is a gift: multinational cannabis curator Clever Leaves ($CLVR).

- [Low debt, trading at a fraction of the multiple of most frothy cannabis stocks.](https://twitter.com/tdanetwork/status/1341821648027201538?s=21)
- Revenue, EBIDTA positive. Est: $53M rev, $3M EBIDTA in 2021, $124M, $30M EBIDTA in 2022. Easily a double up opportunity.
- Export/import license in the EU.
- Warrants to grow more than half of all of Columbias weed. If I know anything about Columbia, its that they have a lot of drugs.
- Ex. McKinsey, Bain in leadership group. If they can figure out how to get the entire world hooked on Oxy, I think they can figure out how to keep this cash cow mooing.
- Big upside in all of cannabis space if the Senate flips blue and federal decriminalization of the green passes.

A post-SPAC thats EBIDTA positive, trading down on no news, below warrant price, with competent leadership in a retail friendly space? Good luck getting rid of your erection before the clock turns to 2021.

Title: GT (Goodyear Tires): While everyone is posting trades that have already rocketed, this one is only starting.
Looking at only technical analysis Goodyear is poised for a breakout in the next two months. It is right below the monthly 20SMA at the bottom of the multi year charts. While many stocks have already risen from the low earlier this year this one has risen slowly.

2021 will be an amazing year for all tire makers but because it is an American company you can expect it to get a bit more of a boost in sales. Travel is the last industry to rise and as many will still be scared to travel next year on airplanes we will have an uptick in road trips leading to more tires being bought. 2020 had a 2.46 road trip rating vs an estimated 3.58 for 2021 compare that to 2019 of 3.24 and you can see where this is going.

So whats next? Well its time to do what WSB does best and make it moon for all of us. This is your chance to get in at the bottom before it moons!

Title: EV battery play: manganese miners
Its probably been said but manganese makes up approx 2/3 of most electric vehicle batteries and is being utilized in TSLA evs. There are a few manganese miner stocks to choose from as a play for future EV growth: AMYZF and MNXXF. The estimated demand for manganese in 2022 is forecasted to reach 28.2 million metric tonnes. Compare this to historical rates of manganese production, which peaked in 2014 at 18.0 million MT. Lots of room for this industry to go as EV production ramps up, theyll all need manganese. Manganese is also used in steel production. 

TLDR: 3 major components to EV batteries. lithium and cobalt (the other two) have mooned recently and manganese should be next.

Im long shares of both tickers mentioned.

Title: PLTR Quicky
Here is a lil gas station quickie for yall on PLTR. Back when PLTR hit the AT of $33 it dropped down to $21 where in found a bottom. There was also a gap up on 12/2 that your wifes boyfriend needs to fill. I could see the drop continuing down to $22 and establishing a support. 

If you have weeklys or have shares do yourself a favor and buy your wifes boyfriend something nice so he can go fill that gap. 

Position 730 shares

Title: SNAP Earnings
I'm longbull SNAP regardless. Unfortunately I actually had a 60C 2/19/21 back when it was trading around $25. Paperhands, what can I say? Hoping to have learned my lesson this time and maybe even pass something along to you guys.

In short, SNAP has done great for Earnings each Q, something I could only really compare to DIS off the top of my head. Last Earnings the stock rose roughly $8 overnight and ending that week with a gain of almost $14. It is currently at $50.

Earnings are coming up on 2/2.

Half DD, half wondering if there's a reason no one on here talks about it and I'm just missing something.

60C 1/8/21  was $8 and if it hits will be about $100+ so just a random play.

# GME God Ryan Cohen has spoken.

"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." Idk what this meant so I typed in google and got this answer " it's easier to stop something from happening in the first place than to repair the damage after it has happened. "

I think this is a strong message for all the shorts frantically covering their positions right now. He's obviously referring to the short squeeze here and warning all the shorts to cover their positions now before MOASS happens.

Title: BBY and why you Best Buy it
  

**MY POSITIONS:**

**5x BBY $104c**  **5 Feb 21**

**10x BBY $120c** **19 March 21**

Best Buy is a seriously undervalued stock at the moment. I do not think this will be a stock that will double, even within 2021. However, this is a very solid play that I personally believe will print a solid 30%. This is a fundamental play and full disclosure I am not a professional trader.

Alright lets get down to it. 

Despite me thinking those nerdy sons of bitches that sit in the corner would eventually prove they are a bunch of retards, Best Buy has absolutely fucking killed it the last few years, including 2020. For some reason analyst have been shitting on this stock for a while. However, many analyst and companies have been moving their positions to a buy with a price target of around $125. Well, this retard agrees with those retards.  BBY might not be going to the moon, but shell go from being a dead fish in bed to at least faking an orgasm. 

The below information is a comparison between the **Nine Months Ending** of November 2, 2019 and October 31, 2020. To oversimplify this for some of you slower folk, its this year vs last year. BBY pulled back from a 52 Week high of $124.89 to right around $101.38 yesterday. This has happened despite a rather substantial increase in many metrics. These metrics are a culmination of both domestic and international stores. However, BBY is **ceasing all operations in Mexico** hopefully by early fiscal 2022. They will remain in Canada (which will now be their only international business segment).   

 Retained earnings increased 23.2%

 Diluted EPS increased from 2.96 to 3.74

 Revenue increased from 1.3% to 6.6%

 SG&amp;A as % of Revenue **DECREASED** from 20.1% to 18.3%

 Domestic online revenue grew roughly 174%

&amp;#x200B;

Below is a breakdown of their business segments and how their sales increased:

 **Computing and Mobile Phones**: The 21.5% comparable sales gain was driven primarily by computing and tablets, partially offset by declines in mobile phones.

 **Consumer Electronics**: The 21.1% comparable sales gain was driven primarily by home theater and digital imaging. 

 **Appliances**: The 39.3% comparable sales gain was driven by large and small appliances.

 **Entertainment**: The 17.5% comparable sales gain was driven primarily by gaming, virtual reality and drones, partially offset by declines in movies.

 **Services**: The 12.7% comparable sales gain was primarily due to our warranty and support services.

&amp;#x200B;

Below is some general information about BBY and a few quotes from their latest quarterly report:

**General Info:**

 BBY increased ALL employees pay to a minimum of $15 an hour

o This is huge because it is statistically proven that the amount of pay employees receive directly   
effects their performance, and therefore BBYs performance.

o I realize its not huge, but when you are struggling that is a huge deal

 They issued $650 million in new notes due Oct 1, 2030 at 1.95%. They are using this to pay off $650 million debt coming due March 15, 2021 at 5.50% - **Huge savings for them**

 They donated 40 million to their foundation to help reach their goal of 100 Teen Tech Centers

o This helps underserved kids to have access to technology

**Quotes:** **Very important info here!**

 On February 23, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a $3.0 billion share repurchase program. There is no expiration date governing the period over which we can repurchase shares under the February 2019 authorization. On March 21, 2020, we announced the suspension of all share repurchases to conserve liquidity in light of COVID-19-related uncertainties. We resumed repurchases in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. 

o **As of October 31, 2020, $1.9 billion of the $3.0 billion share repurchase authorization was available.**

 Our better-than-expected sales resulted in significant operating income rate expansion and earnings growth of 33% over the same period last year.

**------- And here is the best one -------**

 **Historically, we have generated a large proportion of our revenue and earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.**

o Their sales and revenue have increased substantially **AND** their **MOST** profitable quarter is yet   
to be reported. 

&amp;#x200B;

**So, what the fuck does all this mean?**

The buybacks alone should increase the stock 5%. 

They are raking in money hand over fist, despite their most profitable quarter not being reported. 

They are getting the fuck out of Mexico (it wasnt profitable this year and barely profitable in years prior)

They took advantage of the current interest rates and are restructuring their debt, smart.

They are investing in their employees by paying them more **AND** helping them with COVID related hardships

**TLDR:**

BBY has drastically increased their revenue due to a huge increase in sales while managing to actually reduce their costs as a % of revenue. Their most profitable quarter (4th quarter) is yet to be reported and I know they will kill it.

**MY POSITIONS:**

**5x BBY $104c**  **5 Feb 21**

**10x BBY $120c** **19 March 21**

**Geek squad shall be taken over by Greek squad!!** 

Thanks for reading. Happy Holidays.

Title: $WDC is on the rebound
Take a second from jerking of into your ramen bowl for some DD.

If any of you, like me, have hung out with your drunk uncle during Christmas (who is now an unemployed ex-engineer)... youve probably have heard of semiconductors. 

The semi-conductor (memory) market is cyclical and we are currently at the bottom of the cycle. 

DRAM pricing is increasing next quarter which is why $MU is already mooning. 

$WDC is next. SSD pricing will increase by mid 2021 meaning the time to buy is now.

WHY? People are buying a crap ton of laptops/PCs and hunkering down in their holes. And 5G phones are packing a lot more memory.

Title: AAPL is the 2021 Play
Missed out on the TSLA run in 2020? Aww, thats cute. You must be new to WSB. Well heres your source of tendies for 2021 if youre not a complete idiot and you can afford modest leaps. 

Some proper DD. Im not citing sources, yall can Google shit.

- They have around $200B cash on hand
- They had 34% increase in sales just on Xmas (278M)
- With the M1 processor, theyve increased interest in their hardware again. Winning back jaded fanboys and killing the hackintosh community almost overnight.
- Their iPhone 12 sales are rumored to be strongest mobile sales to date.
- The stock is up over 80% in 2020 despite a pandemic

Now for bias and my own opinions:

Ive been following Apple most of my life. I worked on some of the first hackintosh distros (iatkos) as a broke college student. I can tell you definitively that a massive majority of Apple users are in the digital media and production space. With their prioritization on services the last few years, theyve really slacked in staying competitive in hardware. Theyve also made some weird plays at being different without actually innovating. Thats changed entirely this year. Their next earnings is going to reflect that. The M1 is a game changer. Almost everyone I know (which is hundreds of people in the digital agency space) have already or are planning on grabbing up Mac minis or Airs because of the chip and price point. Apple is pretty much recession proof at this point. 

My predictions:

- 10% price increase leading up to Q1 earnings just off anticipation.
- 20% price increase post Q1 (probably within a week or two) and pre Q2
- An easy 100% increase by year end.

My play:

Get calls on discount now. Near ITM for next earnings call. OTM leaps.

Title: $SNOWing in Hell
Straight down to HELL

Here is to playing the IPO crush. $SNOW is about to unleash the cracken of shares to the market within the next week.

SNOW went public Sept 16 at $120 and ran up to $400. There has been limited liquidity in the market which substantially increased the price action and support. Well, the end is here. 

37 million more shares will be available to sell into the market. Buffet and other 10% owners will start to sell on January 4th with the final release on all 37 million shares is January 7th. There are another 300 million shares to be released in March.

I think itll hold around $300 through today. Then this ship is going south for a few days until a full release. Then this shits going down to hell. Then itll come back because its a great company that is super overvalued at the moment.

The average daily volume is respectable 3.89Mil Shares. Between today and January 8th, another 37Mil Shares will be available to sell into the market. How many Shares to be sold before that drop happens?

That is it on this Shit Ship

Title: Huya Inc. E-Sports Live Streaming Leader
&amp;#x200B;

 

## Who Said You Cant Make Money Playing Video Games?

https://preview.redd.it/vdqvt05ugj861.png?width=631&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=021e1344e7a197dd4e2d273c9dbb1c05c727fa26

 The current revenue streams of the e-sports industry in 2020 already bring in over $1.1 billion ($US). Over 75% of revenues in the e-sports industry come from Sponsorships and media rights; however with the expansion of the industry we are likely to see a growth in new monetization methods to capture the growing revenue capabilities. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m01cfvlxgj861.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bc381d46895858110f3b12ec249d185dfd0eef3

 From a current viewership standpoint, the 2020 e-sports audience is at 495 million viewers worldwide. This figure however fails to capture viewers of amateur video game live streamers; the overall number of viewers of video game live-streaming is closer to 1 billion in 2020. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xfxq36z3hj861.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13af84f0831065a7938110f5ec4658c46245a22e

https://preview.redd.it/newqigu5hj861.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f18682939fba6a73e478a18599071b7738420643

 

The outlook for potential growth in both the professional e-sports industry, as well as amateur viewership of video game live-streaming is huge. E-sports revenue is expected to grow about 15% CAGR through 2023 with the e-sports audience expected to grow about 10.5% CAGR through 2023 reaching 646 million viewers.

Covid-19 has been harsh on many industries, e-sports included. With the cancellations of tournaments and hundreds of local events, revenue of this rapidly growing industry has taken a hit however, there is always a silver lining. The changes in audience habits and Covid-19 lockdown measures have caused an exponential growth in viewership numbers for game live-streaming platforms. More and more young individuals are opting to watch content creators live stream their favorite game rather than watching TV.

We can see the factors that are causing the e-sports industry to grow at an astounding rate, however which country is best positioned to capitalize on this growth? No country is better positioned to dominate this market than China. The rapid growth of video game live-streaming in China has attracted players and viewers globally to professional tournaments in the country. China is the capital of the e-sports industry and has declared e-sports a sport since 2007. The growing e-sports infrastructure and massive population in China will facilitate massive growth for many platforms. The question now is, who will emerge an industry leader from this growth?

 

## An Industry Leader Set To Become An Industry Titan

 

One of the current market leaders, with 30-40% of the market share in China and with 173 million monthly average users is set to become an industry titan in the first half of 2021. This company is Huya, and their coming merger with DouYu is set to give the combined company over 300 million monthly active users which represents an 80% market share in China.

HUYA Inc operates a game live streaming platform in China. The company generates the majority of its revenue from sales of virtual items in live streaming platforms as well as other services, which substantially consist of advertising and online game-related services. Since its IPO in 2018, Huya has had several factors slowing its growth and keeping its stock price suppressed. These factors include a 9-month freeze on new video game approvals from Chinese regulators, US &amp; China tensions with Trump as President, Covid-19 market sell off, the recently passed bill that can cause Chinese companies to be delisted from US exchanges, and most recently Chinese regulators reviewing the potential merger with DouYu.

With all these negative catalysts you may ask why is Huya a good investment now. Well for starters we are unlikely to see any sort of freeze on video game approvals in the future as publishers are now adhering to Chinese regulators in fear of another freeze similar to the one done in 2018. Now with Biden set to become the President, we are likely to see eased tensions with China and the bill that was passed gives Chinese 3 years to comply with auditing standards set by the US, majority of Chinese companies will have nothing to worry about and have plenty of time to prevent them from being de-listed. Lastly, the review by Chinese regulators of the merger with DouYu is a standard review and was requested by Huya to avoid fines similar to what Chinese regulators have given companies like Alibaba and Tencent. With all these headwinds gone I believe Huya is set to have massive growth in 2021.

The risk still remains that Chinese regulators will block the merger with DouYu, however Huya is still well positioned in the game live streaming market with continuing growth in active users, growing margins, new monetization methods to capture more revenue, and potential for sponsorships and media rights being one of the market leaders in China. Another risk is the Chinese regulators; the CCP has been harsh with its anti-trust crackdown with a recent example of them blocking Ant Groups IPO. Chinese regulators made it clear that they would ensure companies know where they stand next to the state and this factor is always a risk when it comes to investing in Chinese companies. However, we are seeing similar anti-trust crackdown regulations in the US as well, with tech giants like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple all facing scrutiny for what same may deem their monopolistic positions.

 

## An Opportunity To Invest In A Great Company And Industry

 Comparing Huyas valuation to some of its industry peers highlights the fears many investors have when it comes to investing in China. The forward P/E of Huya is significantly low for a high growth stock with close to 90% revenue growth over the past few years. A forward P/E of 19.00 is very cheap for the growth opportunity that Huya holds with the growing industry and capability of becoming an industry titan with the merger with DouYu. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/otwcxizihj861.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed5e37637193f9d35eca1bb0c92f5893bd153710

 Assuming 3 scenarios, bullish, base, and bear case, we arrive at a valuation of $33.98 which means Huya is currently significantly undervalued. A growth rate of 25% for the next 5 years and 15% from years 6-10 is in my opinion very plausible as the e-sports industry will continue to grow significantly and coupled with the merger with DouYu, which will only increase the number of active users in the combined company, we should see massive growth in revenue for Huya. The biggest content creators will want to be where there are the most viewers, and Huya owning 80% of the market share in China will cause of flood of content creators exclusively streaming on Huya and their fans coming along with them. This also opens up the possibility that Huya will own majority of the media rights that come with professional e-sports tournaments and sponsorships of these tournaments and e-sports teams. 

 

## A Long Term Hold With Huge Potential

 In conclusion, we have an already well positioned company in an industry that is set to see massive growth in the coming years. Along with its already strong position, their potential merger with DouYu will create an industry titan with an 80% market share in China as well as the company expanding to other regions in the world such as South America and Southeast Asia. With majority of the companys headwinds behind them, we should see huge growth in 2021 and beyond. E-sports is already well recognized around the world with hundreds of colleges in the US already offering scholarships for e-sports players. Huya will need to continue to monetize new methods of generating revenue and continue to pursue media rights and sponsorship deals as these are the main streams generating revenue for the s-sports industry globally. Overall, I am very confident Huya see massive growth over the next few years and solidify itself as one of the industry titans in the game live streaming and e-sports industry, thus I am bullish on Huya as a great long term hold.

Title: Calls on Nigerian Scam Jumia - $90K Buy In
  

[position proof](https://i.imgur.com/We4aZF0.jpeg)

**IPO and Shitron** 

I guess to start off Ill preface with the Shitron and Jumia IPO dilemma. Andrew Left is a short seller being used a signal for short and distort attacks that he may be in cohorts with, with other funds. The idea of him being a single individual with poor grammatical prowess is a front. Based on borrow fees it is likely Left and friends shorted at IPO with possession of information that he gained either through corroboration with others, purchased, etc. He released the hit piece that I summarize and comment on below. That hit piece took JMIA from $50 to $2. The reason for such a violent decline is multifactored, that derives from the Citron report, legitimate financial struggles, and lastly (but just as important) is just how low the JMIA float is. They IPOd with just 13 Million shares. A short and distort attack on a stock that will inherently already be volatile, is what did JMIA in. There were not enough shares to go around, making it easier to manipulate. Coincidentally (or not) it was one of the first plays on Citrons new hedge fund. Jumia did have a recent dilution, but they still sit as one of the lowest multi-billion-dollar companies in the market in regards to share float. It puts them along the lines of SEB and BRKA. To put things in perspective the float of your favorite meme stock (e.g., QS, NIO, etc. is anywhere from 10 to 200 times larger).

&amp;#x200B;

In summary of the report Shitron and Co. claimed the following

**Securities Fraud and Smoking Gun**

Accuses JMIA of wanted to do what every other IPO is interested in which is raising funds and allowing original investors to exit. The modus operandi of Rocket Internet is to start these startups and exit early on them. The MTN exit was likely related to debt reduction as around that time they were ordered to pay over $1B USD in fines to Nigeria. They also tried to tack on the sale of Konga by Naspers, that it being a 90% loss is a signal. This is actually not true as the sale was undisclosed, there is NO source that this was what was lost. However, if we assume its true Naspers a $90B dollar company lost less than $80 million on Konga, based on its total investments. 

http://www.chinagoabroad.com/en/article/r20-billion-jumia-ipo-could-help-mtn-reduce-debt-burden

**They claim to present some of many MATERIAL DISCREPANCIES, which we can assume what is presented is the WORST discrepancy that exists:**

**Claimed that the 20%-30% discrepancy in users in filings is fraud:**

This statement was unsourced with a link, claiming it came from an anonymous source. Realistically the data was separated by over a span of 6 months (or two quarters). Since being listed and reporting users this has been the average growth in users falling in line with the alleged discrepancy in user data. There has also been commentary that this is more of a reporting issue in terms of differing definition of sellers/merchants.

**High returns, failed deliveries, and cancellations:**

The return rate of 14% is actually not that high. Retail products at the consumer level have high return rates. The failed delivery rate is a result of the cash system that is employed in some communities. It requires a person to person confirmation, lack of communication results in a high number of failed deliveries. He later mentions this and sources the SEC document that this also results in financial losses in terms of delivery payment theft, but doesnt mention that literally directly after that statement, that the issue has been corrected with the development of a payment processor.

https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/10/growing-online-sales-means-more-returns-and-trash-for-landfills.html

**History of fraud in Nigeria**

The source on this is an odd one, but regardless of validity, the amount allegedly stolen was small ($4m) and neither employee is still employed. The stock market is filled with companies that are thriving with past, present, and future reports of fraud at significantly higher magnitudes. 

In terms of the sketchy sale to Jeremy hondra, I cannot find a source on it, not even the quotes. So, I cant comment on it in-depth, but I will say that $1 business sales are not unheard of. It's likely those businesses were losing significantly more than $3m a year and JUMIA and its other investors thought it was worthwhile to bring back, or it was a part of whatever agreement existed between the two.

**Lack of audit**

The stock was underwritten by JP Morgan and others, it would be in their financial interest that everything checks out with JMIA. Shitron implies in their statements that the alleged Nigerians under Ernst and Young (EY) cant perform an audit. In the same document EY says they conduct audits to the standard of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.

They go on to say that 

As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over **financial reporting** but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the **financial statements**, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The report makes it seem like it's an unaudited business. The source link doesnt even take you to the right page. Either way audits of Jumia are currently available. 

https://www.annualreports.com/HostedData/AnnualReports/PDF/NYSE\_JMIA\_2019.pdf

**Long Perspective**

With that being said Andrew Left and friends recently reversed their opinion and gave it a $100 price target. Some say it is genuine others think it's just to double dip and short it again. I personally dont give a fuck what his intentions are. In the short term, its a part of what caused Octobers the run-up, in the long run, stonks only go up. But more seriously, citrons value is using his career clout to acquire information, and strategically short these companies. Its not really in his MO to change opinions publicly unless he wants that information to be publicly held. In the sense that he wants the public to know and as a trader you understand thats that what he wants, but I never really think past that. 

As for JMIA Im going to save the talk on African Amazon, especially considering amazon income is from being a cloud computing company more than it is a retail store. Also, while I disagree with Citrons allegations, I do agree with the theme that Jumia is dysfunctional. But Ive only ever made money off dysfunction, and the dysfunction of Jumia is just a reflection of Nigeria and not JUMIA the company. In fact, I take Jumias ability to function in Nigeria as a positive sign. While theyve hemorrhaged money in the past and continue to do so they are on the path to profitability, with EPS increasing quarter after quarter, and little long term and short-term debt. The value of Jumia has been linked to the expected growth of Nigeria but I have zero hope in Nigeria. The value of Jumia will actually be in its expansion in east and north Arica. Amazon has already in the region of North Africa with its buyout of souq. Net Income for Jumia is still increasing YoY in these regions as well with increased usage of Jumias payment processor. Online retail shopping will increase with increasing global access to the internet, especially with the maturation of starlink. The processor and logistics is also where I see the growth occurring especially if both services break away from being a Jumia exclusive, and becomes involved in some of the industrializations of parts of Africa. They have an upcoming earnings report Feb 9th that I believe itll hit ATH around said date. Over the past few months, institutions have been buying it heavily prior to the earnings. Part of the anticipation is increased adoption of JumiaPay under covid.

Title: Canoo Stop or GOEV
Ive originally posted this DD in another sub but given its popularity a few people have asked me to post it in r/wallstreetbets as well. I was a bit hesitant at first because one of my post got removed by the mods when this company was still a SPAC. But now since December 22nd it is trading on the Nasdaq as a new public company with the ticker GOEV.

This post may or may not be removed by the mods but here you go as requested. 

Im a former sell side professional for a big firm so my methodology is based on my experience and the information publicly available including data and financial projections published by the company. In consequence I have less data and insight than insiders and early Hedge Funds investors. This is my personal view and not a recommendation of any sort.

Prerequisite is that you already know the basics of Canoo which is a Californian based EV company pre production and pre revenue. Their unique selling points include a proprietary steer-by-wire skateboard technology so they can interchange top hats and develop new vehicles much faster and a subscription-only business model for their first B2C lifestyle vehicle. They also have B2B EV on a more classic selling scheme. 

I invite you to read the top comments from the OP as they contain valuable developments. 

**The Market Cap and New Shares Issuance**

Based on SEC filings the number of shares of new Canoo is as follows:

* 175M held by old Canoo shareholders (including management and employees)
* 32.325M held by PIPE
* 37,307,189 Hennessy C A C converted to GOEV which for now represents the only tradable shares at this time

To which we need to add shares that could be issued in the next weeks:

* 36,092,750 warrants (ratio 1 warrant for 1 share) of which 22,511,250 public and 13,581,500 private
* 15M Earnout Shares for management: three lots of 5M shares each at Milestones for share price to reach $18 $25 and $30

aggregating all these elements and only 5M Earnout Shares so far we get 285,724,939 outstanding shares ; at $14.50 per share thats a market cap of $4.14bn. Note that you would get an extra dilution of 1.7% for every 5M new Earnout Shares issued. Also there is a lack of transparency until Canoo produces a new SEC filing in which the company update the exact number of outstanding shares. For instance when I check market cap on IBKR it would tell me $3.6bn and a totally wrong number of shares. I did not find any info about the PIPE lock period to hold their shares. In fact these kind of deals can remain undisclosed for a certain time. But some large pre existing shareholders including founders, directors, holders of 3%+ pre-SPAC have deals to hold their shares for a total of 116.2M for a period in between 6M to 12M after the Closing of the Business Combination (21-Dec-20).

**Chairman Tony Aquila vs CEO Ulrich Kranz**

I want to address this subject early in this thread for three reasons. First it is not discussed enough on the internet. Second it potentially has massive implications in the public perception of the company. And third insiders and HF have a massive advantage if they know what drama is going on amid the board. I believe it was first reported by The Verge dot com so Ill quote them on the matter:

Aquila told The Verge the companys immediate focus has changed. When I invested in [Canoo], I didnt invest in it for the lifestyle vehicle. To me, I saw that as a derivative, but that the real asset was this multipurpose delivery platform, he said.

The way I would look at it is this is a re-founding of the company, just kind of like Elon did to Tesla. Aquila, who comes from a finance and software background, invested $35M in Canoo this summer through his firm before the merger and before he was elevated to chairman. He put money in [Tesla], just like I did, became the chair, had a different vision, comes out of the tech world. So I can completely relate and appreciate what hes done for the industry.

Founders always intended to use the vans modular platform to power other vehicles, but Aquila is supercharging that vision by accelerating those plans.

With that in mind, there are changes being made to corporate structure. Ulrich Kranz, one of the BMW executives who co-founded Canoo and the current CEO, is no longer on the companys board of directors. Hell instead be a special adviser to Aquila, and while hell remain CEO, his contract was renegotiated and now includes language that accounts for the possibility of him being replaced (SEC filings). 

I want to build a world class company here, and what Ive said to everyone is, look, youre going to go as far in this company and as big as this company as we all collectively do. But its like a baseball team. Everybodys got to play their position and theyve got to play it really well for every season, and those positions can change over time, Aquila told The Verge when asked about Kranzs new contract. Theres definitely a role [for Kranz]. Theres definitely advice that can happen. But to scale an organization at this level, I mean, thats a different experience than he has.

And they add: For what its worth, if Kranz is removed as CEO but remains as Aquilas adviser, his salary will more than triple from $648K to $2.5M. [end of quote]

Now, it is up to the market and every single investor to ultimately judge this move. What is irrefutable although is that it injects a lot of uncertainty to the company at a very sensible time when they just turned public. My personal opinion is I dont like at all. I am way more confident with an individual as Kranz who has co-founded the company, who used to be the boss of Project i at BMW. He led the release of the gorgeous i8 and the i3 who are arguably among the most iconic EV produced by traditional automakers. Hes an engineer with a long track-record in the auto industry and he sounds humble. On the other hand you have a late investor who didnt do anything significant in the industry who just ousted Kranz from the board. And to add insult to injury he dares compare himself to Papa Musk.

Now imagine you have millions on the line. A company pre revenue. Egocentric chairman who is trying to be the new Elon. And you got in at $10 per unit with a free 1-for-1 warrant to ride. You can easily imagine it makes sense taking profit and move to the next play. While still having exposition to price appreciation thanks to the warrants. To finish on this point the Investor Presentation and the original YouTube videos presented Kranz as the face of the company. But the latest video on the B2B EV is all about Aquila bragging.

**The Price Action vs Value**

The hot question right now is how low the share price can fall. Its 14.50 at the time of my writing. And it basically been red every single day since the initial GOEV quote on Nasdaq on December 22nd. It actually opened +20% on that day and rallied to 14.90 +27% (10c below the 15.00 Milestone to unlock a new 5M potential issuance to management) but then sharply (maybe surprisingly?) reversed to finish the day negative.

Ill go quickly about valuation because it is solely based on financial projections provided by the company in the Investor Presentation to the SEC in August 2020. I agree that they proposed conservative assumptions although there is obviously a variety of risks which could prevent them to reach their goals. On a DCF model you get 3 scenarii with $12.25 $18.50 and $24.50 price targets low mid high (before any dilution / new shares) on a 20% discount rate. Interestingly the SOTP model including a Netflix type of business model / margins for the B2C would bring you to a $35.75 per share. 

Thats based on what they knew about themselves in the summer. Closer to the Business Combination date they have raised their guidance: Hennessy said on 7 Dec: Since announcing the transaction, Canoo has seen substantial growth in consumer demand and significant interest from potential partners in its proprietary market leading EV platform and underlying technologies. Canoo is efficiently allocating capital by leveraging this platform and has identified new opportunities significantly increasing its TAM (total addressable market) in both B2B and B2C (business to customer) end markets. We have never been more excited about the future of Canoo and look forward to closing our planned merger later in December.

There is a clear disconnection between the perceived discounted value of the company and the probably exaggerated beating the share price is taking since it is floating as a new Canoo. Undoubtedly a lot of paper handed retail investors have been shaken - some of them at a loss. But again thats the Risk and Reward of a SPAC play in general and furthermore through merger. It is designed for HF to make risk-less money in exchange of lending large amounts for the initial SPAC-IPO. Nobody wants to pay the bill once the redemption window has closed.

If you are a mid long term believer in Canoo the brand then $15 a share is cheap for what this company could become - all things equal. 

**The Vision**

When I imagine an individual vehicle in the near future I for sure think of a non-fossil energy one. So EV or any sustainable energy are the sense of history. But what about consumption habits?

It used to be: you buy a car you lose circa 20% VAT value as soon as youve paid the check  + an extra % of value instantly destroyed because it becomes a second-hand product without a natural price appreciation (as opposed to a house or a Swiss manufactured watch). You have to take care of it, insure it and when you dont need it anymore you need to engage time, effort, and cost to resell it. 

I can totally see their B2C business model playing out: you download an app, you register, you choose your skin, you pay $599 a month (maybe less?) and you go driving your EV. Insurance, caretake, charging included. Once youve bored of it you finish your month and thats it. No more liability no headache. The next step being the car drives itself to a certain degree. Which they also incorporated as about-to-be-ready (2.5 autonomy out of 5). But apparently thats not good enough for Aquila who wants to push B2B. I have the feeling the stock is being partly punished for his arrogance. 

**The PR and Marketing**

See for yourself. Go on their insta and YouTube and compare with the other EV competitors outside of the whales Tesla and so on. They are above. They took communication seriously. You can even spot Off-White and Bape skins in one of their promo video. But again they must decide on who will be The Face of their brand. And this decision will be extremely pivotal. They are offering a new lifestyle. Dont show off an old irrelevant investor or get punished for it.

One word on American-made: I believe there is a tradition of buying American cars for the American people. So its going to be Tesla on the U.S soil or among the new offering locally designed. I dont see Nio and the likes gaining a significant market share over there. That said Canoo has had large Chinese investors stakes before the SPAC.

**The Warrants**

I have witnessed a lot of speculation around them so lets have a clearer picture. The company wrote: Each Warrant will become exercisable on the later of 30 days after the completion of the Companys initial Business Combination or 12 months from the closing of the Public Offering and will expire five years after the completion of the Companys initial Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.

Once the Warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding Warrants in whole and not in part at a price of $0.01 per Warrant upon a minimum of 30 days prior written notice of redemption, only in the event that the last reported sale price of the Companys shares of Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within the 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the Warrant holders. [end of quote]

I know its not that easy to read so let me go straight to the point. GOEVW (so the Warrant) will be exercisable once both these 2 events have passed. Initial SPAC-IPO (5-Mar-19) +12months so 5-Mar-20 so that has passed we clear. And Business Combination was on 21-Dec-20 +30days = on 21st January 2021 the Warrant will be exercisable. The company can not redeem the warrants before they are exercisable. 

So I personally dont see any sophisticated scheme here. They are 1 for 1 ratio with an exercise price of $11.50. The intrinsic value is 3.00 when GOEV is 14.50. They have ranged 3.20 3.82 today with a now price of 3.45 (on 14.50 ref). So the extra 0.45 is comparable to the time value in options. The expiry is quite far on 25-Sep-25 so the time decay or theta burn is negligible on a daily basis. Altogether that could be an indication that warrant holders are not panicking and not dumping their W for a discount and estimate that GOEV is credible enough to trade above 11.50 on a long haul.

**Open Thread**

This was supposed to be a quick write-up but it actually took longer than I thought and I probably will add more elements in the edit and/or comments.

Title: GNOG a pure online gambling stock
I haven't seen a lot people who have talked about GNOG on this sub. GNOG is golden nugget online gaming and it's a great company to look into. They currently have a market cap of $2 billion but I think there is room for a lot of growth. The best thing is... THEY ARE PROFITABLE!!

GNOG is in a fast growing sector. More and more states are allowing online gambling. They are mainly focussed on online casino but they do also offer sports wagering. Online casino is more profitable than sports wagering

They have a very high growth rate. They grew revenues 55% just over the months of januari to april while the overall NJ market grew 40% in that time. This means they are taking more market share.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/itsfa0s22j861.png?width=1043&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0a92a105679b7303a7c4c70c107eddceb0d143a

Golden nugget already is a well known name so they already have a ton of brand recognition. The owner is also Tilman Fertitta so you can expect a ton of pumps when he is on CNBC. Papa fertitty will get GNOG to the moon.

The company just started trading under the ticker GNOG so it's still going to have huge price swings. But in the long run, if we look at what multiples DKNG is trading, this has potential.

&amp;#x200B;

I got 1500 shares of GNOG cuz I'm way to big of a pussy to trade options.

Title: The Mother of All Short Squeezes: GME, is it a myth?
Preface: I have no positions in GME currently.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Mother of All Short Squeezes**

Volkswagen is often referred to as the "mother of all short squeezes." This short squeeze temporarily gave Volkswagen the largest market capitalization of any company in the world in 2008, when it quadruled in size over a few days (400% gain):

https://preview.redd.it/ibsya8j7qi861.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f7d6df799e607c9d33c18fc6d02c366eaf5d37c

Many hedge funds were short Volkswagen, and were caught off guard when Porsche announced that it had effectively gained control of 74% of Volkswagen's voting shares. There was a very short supply of Volkswagen shares with which to cover short positions with, leading the stock to soar as hedge funds desperately tried to cover their positions.

The unexpected news, combined with a very small float (= tradable shares) and large number of short positions, conspired to drive the shares through the roof. Some hedge funds are reported to have lost billions as a result of the squeeze.  

To put this in numbers: 1m shares were traded daily on average before the squeeze, and the available float was 135m shares at the time. This meant when funds came to buy back their shorts, sellers could charge a premium as there were so few willing to sell, driving the price up. It would take on average, 1/3 of a year for the whole float to change hands!

So the main point here is that a limited supply of shares is crucial for a true **short squeeze**. 

&amp;#x200B;

**So does this apply to GME?**

There are 60m total shares available in the float for GameStop. The average daily trading volume for GME is **15m shares**. That means the entire float is traded in 4 days, basically weekly! This incredible amount of liquidity means supply is never a problem.

If funds had to buy back in to close their short position, they could, and the price would barely move. They would not have a hard time covering their position, and could buy back in without anyone ever noticing (until the next bi-weekly short interest report is released, which by then would be too late).

Just yesterday on a slow day 6m shares were traded (1/10 available), with less than 1% change in the price. Also this translates to $115 million exchanging hands, in one day. This kind of money isn't retail, it'll be market makers and funds who know all this information and more.

Whilst it's true the short interest is high for GME, around 50%-100% (over 10% is considered substantial), the fact that supply is not an issue, means the risk for these funds has not increased substantially. And it's all about the risk/reward in this game.

&amp;#x200B;

And so for that reason you autists, I'm afraid the impeding short squeeze is just a myth.

&amp;#x200B;

Title: LMND DD 
**Alright retards**, PLTR is sick and all but its not exactly mooning. Heres a stock that is mooning and I predict will continue to for a long time.

Lemonade $LMND is a disruptive insurance company. Thats it. Truth is, I doubt anyone here knows much about the insurance industry but you dont really have to. These guys are attracting loads of young people, are changing the way insurance companies are viewed (from evil to good) and are using technology to make the whole process cheap and easy.

**$LMND:** The stock has more than doubled in the last month and its market cap currently sits at $7 billion. Think thats a lot?[ Think again](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/111314/top-10-insurance-companies-metrics.asp). This is insurance were talking about people.

State Farm market cap: $64.4 Billion.

Allstate: $30.6 Billion.

Berkshire Hathaway: &gt;$300 Billion.

**Lemonade could be more worth all of these companies combined.** Thats what disruptors do. Tesla is now worth more than many other car companies combined because they disrupted the fuck out them. Dont be a gay bear and bet against a disruptor.

**Growth:**[ In force premium doubled year-on-year, while gross profit increased 83%, adjusted gross profit grew 138%, and net loss - per dollar of gross earned premium - halved.](https://s24.q4cdn.com/139015699/files/doc_downloads/2020/11/Q3-2020-Shareholder-Letter.pdf) YUGE.

**The CEOs:** Daniel Schreiber and Shai Wininger, two extremely successful driven dudes. Maybe youve heard of Fiverr, or should I say[ $FVRR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/fvrr?ltr=1) which has absolutely fucking **mooned** this year. Maybe these boys know a thing or two about starting a successful company?

**Total Addressable Market:** Insurance is a huge industry, 5 trillion dollars worldwide. Right now all they do is pet, homeowners and renters insurance But they currently have plans to expand to term life insurance (another huge market) and eventually car insurance. They just released Lemonade in France too. *Frappe mon cul et appelle-moi Nancy. Ils sont l'international.*

**Lockup Period:**  The stock took quite a dip last week with the lockup period ending on the 12/29, but now is back up.  Nobodys sold yet so looks like insiders (which currently hold 75% of the shares) are still quite confident despite the big run up in the last couple months.

**Millennial/Gen Z appeal:** People fucking hate insurance companies. Any company that can change this relationship and gain market share will inevitably grow a lot. These guys give some money to charities which makes young people pitch a tent. Also their logo is sexy and pink which is sure to make everyone cream their jeans. If their customers are creaming, investors are creaming.

70% OF THEIR CUSTOMERS ARE UNDER 35!!!  THOSE ARE LIKELY CUSTOMERS FOR LIFE!  SMELL. THE. TENDIES.

**Customer Satisfaction:** I'm not gonna lie, this piece is not my best DD right here, but if you go through the app store and look at different insurers reviews, they have the highest rating at 4.9 stars. FUCK IT. That's a good sign.

I am sick and tired of you clutching your PLTR calls hoping that the stock will moon. Stop posting memes about that curly haired data cuck. The hype is fading and r/wsb looks like it got whipped in the balls. And Gamestop? Really?  Whens the last time any of you retards stepped into a fucking Gamestop?  Lemonade is barely on people's radar.  Stop being a fucking cuck to these stocks.

**TLDR:**  Lemonade is disrupting the insurance industry which rakes in billions every year.  Like many disruptors do, it could end up being worth much more than the other guys 10-30x its current value.  Solid growth, customers like it and insiders havent sold now that the lockup period is over signaling confidence.

Title: ARKG and LRNZ - And The Future of Retards
 If you are sensitive or disagree with me please do one of the  followings: a. Stop reading. b. attack me personally. c. downvote. d. watch shemale vids

So we are all balls deep in GME just like chad and tyrone are balls deep double teaming your sister and are occasionally crossing swords, by sheer accident of course.

The nEw tReNdS oF 2o21

Let's do some 5 star analyst dd here if I may on the nEw tReNdS oF 2o21.

That's right retard mutation and AI:

* ARKG - ARK Genomics
* LRNZ - AI and Deep Learning

Now wtf are these you might ask. Well I've got you covered there.

Biogenics is the future of biotech. Wtf is biogenics? The ETF is actually called Genomics. The future is of us changing our DNA via DNA sequencing and advancing humanity. Mutating ourselves into the next level of retard, if you will. Now imagine combining that with AI and deep learning, whatever that is.

Some technicals indicators: Both are in uptrends riding high, RSI bullish, your sister bullish, your mom bearish, your dad bearish. In short, both great buys on teh dip.

Some fundamental analysis: a few bears are coming out here that ARKG is overextended. That is as bullish indicator as you can get.

Most importantly listen to this, 1+1= 2. 

If that is not a sign then nothing is to go balls deep.

Title: Tesla DD
Past few times that market closed early, and on fridays Tesla has beeen SQUEEEEEEEZING. Due to this epic DD, I will be going balls deep - ( 2 calls) On Tesla. I  am going to be grabbing the 715calls which expire today 12/31.  Youre welcome for getting you rich. I will be back later posting atleast 300% in profits.

Title: Have faith in RC, GME retards!
Greetings retards! 

In my last post on Melvins put options fuckery, I showed that they bought more than $8m worth of 15 Jan $17P/$24P bearish put spreads. Since then, they might have bought another $3m of 15 Jan $17P and 19 Feb $21P bearish diagonal spreads on 29 Dec. (8000 contracts were done discreetly in about 16 smaller transactions. They know us autists are stalking them.)

What these put spreads show is that Melvin is betting on Gamestop to disappoint in its holiday sales update in Jan, and for CEO George Sherman to once again reiterate omnichannel over and over at the ICR conference on 11 Jan.

Is Melvin right? I think GameStop has good odds of beating last years abysmal holiday sales ($1.84bn in sales, 24.5% decrease from 2018). Sherman hinted at the 3Q call that 4Q was profitable and may even have some kind of ace up his sleeve @ ICR (e-sports?), seeing that he moved GameStops presentation slot from the Retail track to the Technology track.

But even the most bullish GME retard cant deny that beating profit/loss estimates does fuck all for GMEs shareprice (3Q EPS beat consensus by 37%). The fact is that Shermans operationalisation of GMEs technology turnaround has the speed and nimbleness of the Titanic trying to get around an iceberg. That he is presenting at ICR after Zoom (56x P/sales) and Asana (22x P/sales) just highlights how far GME (0.25x P/sales) has to go and the amount of convincing that needs to be done to get that obscene tech forward sales multiple. In the meantime, Melvin is going to pull out all the stops to drive the price down to $17, as seen on Tues when GME fell from $20.82 to a low of $18.56. 

So are your 15/1 $24C fucked? Not if our Lord and Saviour RC can help it. Last night, RC tweeted one of his retarded emojis after some CNBC shill put down GME stock. The last time RC did the same (on 10 Dec), he proceeded to buy $37m worth of stock over four days, and drove GME price up 53% from $12.78-$19.46 when his updated 13D came out on 21 Dec. Thats 11 days baby...and what is 11 days from today? 11 Jan - the date when Shermans gonna try to toot his own horn @ ICR. But we will all know that when GME goes to $30 from now til 15 Jan, its not gonna be because of omnichannel, but because of RC.

Tl;dr: RC taking GME on his  again.

Title: $ARCT completely misunderstood
I honestly can't believe how 1 person's opinion can trigger a 50% drop in this company. 

The drop was for the following reasons: 

\- Not moving fast enough 

\- Not enough antibodies 

\- THE BIGGEST REASON: May not be a 1 shot solution

&amp;#x200B;

The facts: 

\- Not moving fast enough: 

They are literally on the timeline that they outlined 4 months ago in their past video. 

\- Not enough Antibodies 

The antibodies after 1 shot of Pfe/ biontech was essentially equivalent to the antibody response in ARCT's first shot. 

THE MAIN DIFFERENCE: 

ARCT's vaccine in 1 shot provided ample antibodies, but also a strong Tcell response. Much better than any other vaccine EVER created. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- May not be a 1 shot solution: 

If you watch this video and actually understand what they're saying. This is ON TRACK to be a 1 shot solution. If ARCT was creating a vaccine like PFE they would not be valued like this. The reason they are valued at what they are is because of the type of mRNA vaccine they creat that is self replicatin and inducing a strong T cell response. Over time it is already, and will continue to show, that this response is effective after 1 shot over time. 

Why T Cell is more important than antibody: [https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/what-is-the-role-of-t-cells-in-covid-19-infection-why-immunity-is-about-more-than-antibodies/](https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/what-is-the-role-of-t-cells-in-covid-19-infection-why-immunity-is-about-more-than-antibodies/)

&amp;#x200B;

Who cares; 

If you seriously think that the couple of vaccines available now are ample for what the demand is you are strongly mistaken. Vaccine demand is for a surplus of vaccines. A multitude of vaccines are needed b/c not all vaccines work for everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

ARCT has the lowest dosage for a vaccine, single shot (yes, still works), cheaper, EASIER TO PRODUCT, EASIER TO STORE, EASIER TO TRANSPORT.   *ARCT*\-021 will be lyophilized, or *freeze*\-dried, so it's can be stored at regular refridgirator temperatures. 

Every other vaccine requires expensive equipment to keep it the right temperature at FREEZER LEVELS, not REFRIDGIRATOR. This is a huge difference number 1, number 2 the size of the equipment carrying the vaccine makes a huge difference. 

PFE has a vaccine that requires 2 doses, stored at freezing temperatures. This is heavier, more expensive, and requires double the shipment / person. 

And for everyone waiting for ARK's approval. They haven't sold, last time it dropped they waited 2 days before buying so you have 1 day left. After that ARK buy goes through you've missed the boat. 

&amp;#x200B;

See you at $90 in Jan.

Before you say "What the fuck. This isn't more GME confirmation bias. Remove shitpost pls."

###**D** **I** **V** **E** **R** **S** **I** **F** **Y**  
So I am dropping my $600 stimbux into some crap EV calls, and would appreciate you telling me why it'll go tits up.  

#**EVs wil fly again and here's why:**
##**WHY? Fundamentals**  
-Sike. Imagine thinking fundamentals matter right now lmao. EV bubble 
  
##**WHYY? Technicals**  
I'm autistic, so I'm better at drawing with crayons than doing actual research.   
Check a look at some EV charts ([**XPEV**](https://imgur.com/a/VOVvp1E) **[WKHS](https://imgur.com/a/APrRIor)** [**NIO**](https://imgur.com/a/FQ63Wws)).    
-Low ADX = consolidation.  
-Declining volume = bullish consolidation.   
-Narrowing Bollinger Bands = low volatility. (Low volatility often leads to high volatility. Volatility contraction can foreshadow a significant advance/decline.)  
-Low IV percentile = options are cheap and volatility is low.    
-WKHS and XPEV: Elliot Wave 3   
-Bullish pennant in NIO; falling wedge in XPEV.    
-Assuming s don't rise up, stonk could = {XPEV: $94 if price&gt;$39, WKHS: $33 if price&gt;$17, NIO: $78 if price&gt;$41} by late Feb/March
  
##**WHYYY? Catalysts**
There's a lot coming next month:  
-Tesla delivery numbers (rising tide lifts all boats).  
-NIO day (9th Jan) + delivery numbers.   
-XPEV delivery numbers.  
-USPS contract for WKHS.  
-Chinese EV expansion into Europe.  
Month long recharging + catalysts =

TL;DR: Long EV stonks cuz they will have a litty titty spring.

Title: MMED DD 
[MMED.NE](https://MMED.NE)

MMEDF

Ive been in this company since day 2 of IPO at $0.95 per share in May. Just heavily increased my position yesterday at 4.00 per share as this news just seems to get better and better and they just had a nice healthy dip. This has been posted in here before but it was deleted by mods as it had a market cap of less then 1B. It is now above that so merry Christmas ya filthy animals!

MindMed is now preparing a total of three Phase 2 commercial drug trials based on psychedelic inspired medicines, making it one of the most advanced and largest drug development pipelines in the psychedelics industry.

MMED acquired exclusive, worldwide data rights to eight completed or ongoing clinical trials from the University Hospital Basel evaluating LSD based on over 10 years of research. MindMed plans to assemble and use this data as part of its briefing package to the FDA.

The company's immediate priority is to address the opioid crisis by developing a non- hallucinogenic version of the psychedelic ibogaine. In addition, the company has established a microdosing division to conduct clinical trials of LSD microdosing for Adult ADHD. The company has also added MDMA to its R&amp;D pipeline in order to explore MDMA's potential to treat mental health disorders. The MindMed executive team brings extensive biopharmaceutical industry experience to this groundbreaking approach to the development of next-generation psychedelic medicines.

**Project Lucy:**

MindMed received the data and worldwide rights to a trial for anxiety disorders administered by the world leader in psychedelics pharmacology and clinical research, Dr.Matthias Liechti, and psychedelic therapy expert, Dr.Peter Gasser. Such data and know how will help build MindMed's understanding of LSD for anxiety disorders and its platform for LSD as a prescription medication for serious mental health conditions.

**Project Layla (18-MC):**

Preliminary data has been analyzed for MindMeds addiction treatment program evaluating the ibogaine derivative 18-MC, which the company has named Project Layla. The preliminary data from the Phase 1 Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) and Single Ascending Dose (SAD) study has shown that the drug is safe and well tolerated at the doses tested to date, and no Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) have been reported.

Based on the excellent safety profile observed to date, MindMeds clinical team and 18-MCs Medical Director, Dr.Judy Ashworth, have decided to continue dose escalation in the study to gather higher dosing data. Once that additional data has been reviewed, MindMed will directly thereafter initiate the Phase 2a proof of concept study. A meeting with the FDA has been confirmed to continue discussions regarding the 18-MC clinical development plan.

**Short term dates:**

Any day now: NASDAQ uplisting (They applied for this exactly 10 weeks ago)

Jan 6th: Offering deal is slated to close

Q3 21: Trial completions

**TLDR:** MMED  within the next 90 days. They now have a large cash position to complete all of their trials. They are aiming at some very large markets including the Opioid crisis, depression, anxiety, and many more (easy 100B+ market) and are getting a ton of support during the process.

Title: Why I'm emptying my bank account and buying long $GOOGL calls
Google seems to get a lot less love than the other tech behemoths. They are sadly not the cutthroat capitalists like Apple or Amazon. But they spend a shit ton on R&amp;D projects like self-driving cars and other weird moonshots that are going to start paying off soon. The nerds in [Silicon Valley](https://www.businessinsider.com/most-desired-tech-companies-to-work-for-google-netflix-slack-2020-9) every year say Google is their most desired company to work for. I've decided to put my all my savings into long options.

**Some Google initiatives or statistics that are cool but not why they are undervalued:**

**Android market share worldwide:** 73%

**Search market share:** 87%

**Youtube:** 600 hours of video uploaded every minute, ad revenues through the roof

**Stadia:** One of projects from their moonshot factory that looked like it would fail spectacularly until the disaster of Cyberpunk 2077 on consoles showed Stadia could provide mid-tier PC performance on games minus the $2,000 for a PC. Huge increase in users since Cyberpunk fiasco.

**Why Im going all in: Google is going to take over the world with AI**

Google owns the top two AI outfits in the world, Google Brain and DeepMind. They are far ahead of their competitors in the most important industry of the future.

DeepMinds AI team solved protein folding this past month. Experts didnt think this would be possible for decades. Their team will receive the first Nobel Prize where a neural network did a majority of the work. The monetization and scientific breakthrough possibilities for their proprietary protein folding prediction models are endless. ([more info](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7wJDJ56c88))

Google Brain and Deepmind are working with Waymo. No other self-driving company has technology that is remotely close to Waymo. Google proprietary AI processors allow them to simulate billions of miles on the road and millions of people help train their models with captchas everyday. Their taxis are already in Arizona with no human operators. There have been no injuries to passengers. There isnt a very small chance the car will kill you like with some [Waymo](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/25/tesla-driver-autopilot-crash) [competitors](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/20/us/self-driving-uber-pedestrian-killed.html). Uber realized the threat that Waymo posed to their business and tried to steal their technology. Waymo destroyed them in court and Uber sold off their self-driving operation this past month. Waymo will be first to market partnered with Lyft and will be significantly cheaper than Uber rides with human drivers. ([more info](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/12/this-arizona-college-student-has-taken-over-60-driverless-waymo-rides/), [2](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/9/17307156/google-waymo-driverless-cars-deep-learning-neural-net-interview))

**Cons:**

**Google is super woke.** From what Ive read their internal message boards make woke twitter look like r/The_Donald. Could definitely be bad for business but they did recently fire one of the libs for jeopardizing their AI business. 

**Politicians want to fuck them.** There is a lot of anti-big tech sentiment on both sides of the aisle now but this has more to do with their enemies (Oracle, Yelp, etc) trying to litigate rather than innovate. I just dont see politicians breaking up a business that consistently ranks as one of the most respected brands in the country according to Morning Consult and which provides so many useful free services to constituents.

Title: More MP DD
For everyone who saw my post about MP Materials, here is another post with more DD that goes into more detail with sources and graphs than mine. (It was made pre-merger so the ticker he mentions is different than the current ticker which is MP)

Title: GameStop GME Background DD and Price Target 69.69 no squeeze and at least 420.69 on a squeeze.
I kept a summary of my reasoning for getting into GameStop (pictured below) I thought I'd share it with everyone so you can have some solid talking points next time you talk to your rich uncle who hopefully is your wife's boyfriend too so you can hang that over his head and have him go all in on some GameStop.

Reasoning for Price Targets using comps:

BBY (Best Buy) currently trades at a market cap / revenue (12 months forward) of 26.25b / 47.45b = 0.55 price / sales.

Because:

1) GME uses a digital first, omni-channel approach

2) Will have positive free cash flows due to the high demand from XBOX/PS5

3) Has a digital revenue sharing agreement with $MSFT

4) Has data from 55 Power Up Rewards members they can sell and leverage for additional revenue streams

5) Has a new insider, our lord and savior, RC god bless, who took CHWY from ground up to now trade at a price to sales of well above 5

Then:

Taking a proprietary formula spoken to me in a dream by RC while Melvin was getting liquidated, I have arrived at a price / sales of 0.843 which is higher than best buy but much less than Chewy. Using analyst estimates for the 12 months forward revs (5.76b) and solving for share price, we get a fair value of  \~**69.69 per share**.

p / 5.76b = 0.8439

share price = p / shares outstanding (69.75m)

**Squeeze PT** 

**RC** said on 12.15.20 ([13D Amendment Link](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119380520001571/e620151_sc13da-gamestop.htm)) that he is ready to be our savior.  This was exactly 14 days ago as we head into a **new year**.

A year is 365 days **minus** 14 days from when RC defended is 351.

Title: BIDU DD
 Reasons to buy BIDU now :

- You retards started talking about it.
- Bad news for Baba on political front could lead to opportunities for Bidu in the segments where they compete since Bidu is more friendly with the tyrants in place in China.
- Bidu is talking about joining the EV party.
- Valuation makes sense from a cashflow perspective for now, which means there is plenty of room for it to be pumped until boomers can't understand what is happening.
- Bidu already has big investments in other trends that generate hype like AI and self-driving tech.
- This could get autistic faster than children getting vaccinated.

TL;DR BIDU210319C00270000

Title: Mach E starts shipping today 
While it might not be quite as amazing as a Tesla, it does have alot going for it, and easily primed to be a massive hit.  Yes, alot of people aren't a fan that its called a Mustang, but what it does have going for it is:

1.  Tesla is its only real competition right now, (Except for Nio as well in the chinese market)
2.  Its a few grand cheaper than a Tesla, but also less features.  (Which is good because it has a hefty profit margin) 
3.  Has a nice EV credit to go with it.  (Ford can pull a tesla and sell EV credits as well)
4.  Has the Ford distribution chain, which is 10x larger than Tesla, with more reach.
5.  Ford will have 0 issues with production like Tesla tends to have
6.  It will be selling globally in 2021, so massive potential in China, especially since nobody in China knows what a "Mustang" car is and its significance so it won't have the same branding issues like it does in America.
7. Produced in Mexico so it has a better Margin than Tesla.  

Position: 2600 Shares and adding. (I usually add anytime its below 8.85)

Title: HECLA Mining has HECKA FDs
From the man who brought you F U V (333x) and CLF (23x), here is my third 10-bagger FD play. I dont know much about the mining industry but who needs to. We trade options not ores on this forum. 

The DD is that FDs are cheap as a motherfucker for how HL is moving and primed to break out relative to its sector. Throw $3 at it if youve got nothing to lose.

If I hit 3/3 Ill donate $100 to autism speaks god bless you retards

Title: HOLD THE LINE GME AUTIST. IF MELVINS PUTS EXPIRE WORTHLESS WE GOING TO PLUTO 
Melvin Capital has over 5.2 million puts against GME. 

This is our moment, this is our time, we say, fuck the big banks. Its their time to get fucked in the ass. They keep swinging their strap on big cock around like its theirs. Its not, its ours now. We must prevail through the unprecedented times. We must become Victorious. This is the way to the utopia. By holding ground and advancing on GME. Buy your shares, buy your calls, do not short. 

Together we can send this baby interstellar. 

God bless and good luck

Victory is near

Title: BUY THE BB DIP
BUY THE DIP 

This isn't even a meme stock!! There's literally no way a tech company as big as Blackberry is so cheaply valued!! 

All that BB needs is some more attention, and WSB is THE PLACE for that to happen! 

The last earnings call sent the stock up BY MORE THAN 85%, and Blackberry has many more great earnings reports to come!! Buy the dip, because THERE'S NO REASON FOR THE PRICE TO BE FALLING RIGHT NOW. 

The only direction it can move is UP!

Title: $MP == Must Play --&gt; MP Materials DD
Heres whats up. For the next energy/tech economy to manifest were going to need a lot of Rare Earth Elements (REEs; meme potential endless  ). REEs are used in most high-end consumer electronics, advanced renewable energy tech, and energy storage tech these days. REEs Neodymium and Praseodymium are critical to the manufacture of strong magnets  for turbines (wind, hydro, gas, etc), and EVs, due to their high efficiency and high energy density. REEs such as Dysprosium are used to increase the operating temperature of the magnets  for high-temp applications. Other REEs are used in the production of smart phones, hard disk drives, military defense systems, and even medical equipment. OK, you get it, theyre useful, and used A LOT. So, whats the big deal?

The majority of REE production is concentrated in just two countries: China (85%) and Australia (\~10%), with the rest scattered around the world (Russia, Brazil, India, etc). In 2010 China significantly restricted their rare earth exports. That was done to ensure a supply of rare earths for domestic manufacturing and for environmental reasons. This shift by China triggered panic buying, and some rare earth prices shot up exponentially.  Geology.com. As the demand for the above tech increases, so will the demand for REEs.   

How rare are REEs? Honestly, it depends on the element in question. The main factor that puts them into this category isnt necessarily their abundance, its the economics of extraction. Theyre difficult to find in concentrations that are worth mining and processing. This decreases supply and drives up the price, causing them to be effectively rare. Why mention this, you ask?

Because the money is to be found in **new raw ore processing/recycling technologies**. So we need better ways to extract REEs from raw ore, and we need better ways to recycle the REEs that are tied up in waste-tech. Were at a point with our tech consumption that weve all probably had at least 1 old smart phone; chances are youve had 3-4 at this point. Currently, companies cannibalize the phones for useful parts, refurb, or throw them away. But this is a HUGE waste of REEs. Additionally, currently, there are no commercial capabilities to separate and process HREEs outside of China.

**Enter MP Materials ($MP)** the only owner of an active REE mine in the US. They recently went public and have been on a steady climb since (up 100% in \~6wks), but I see more room to run. They also recently announced plans to have operational separation capabilities by the end of 2020 (no news as of 12/30). Having an operational REE mine is a HUGE deal,  since the development of additional mines in the US has been stymied. China can (and will) manipulate the prices to make further mine development uneconomical, but they cant price MP out of production entirely (esp with the US govt backing them). They hold investment contracts with the DoD related to these separation technologies as its seen as pertaining to national security.  

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Did a quick search for other DDs on MP; I believe these are complimentary to mine and not redundant.

Title: TGT Retards, Buy Now.
As someone who may or may not work for Target, the company may or may not be doing way better than what it was projected for this quarter when it comes to earnings and volume. Target did amazing last earnings report and if will do even better this time. TGT is going to be AMZNs biggest competitor leveraging Shipt, drive ups, and order pick ups to sell items such as groceries and apparel. Its been an amazing quarter. Today TGT recalled an apparel item for little girls because it was chafing and pinching them so the price dipped a bit.

Title: That old guy shorting GME doesn't exist and you retards are being manipulated
G. Kennedy Fuld Jr isn't a real person, the profile pic is a photo of Michael Milken. 

I'm betting a ton of the commenters and upvoters are bots. This is clear manipulation and dozens of you dinguses who actually started buying shares are ensuring this shit will happen more often. 

Autist Recommendation: Ban everyone in that thread except for the commenters who pointed out what I'm saying.

Title: DD on MP Materials ($MP) 
Before you guys call me a boomer cuck for posting DD on a mining company in this sub, this isn't a boomer gold mining company, this is rare earth materials mining. These materials such as Neodymium are used for batteries in EVs, drones, and pretty much everything that is powered by electricity. China is dominating this market right now with about 85% of the market share. MP materials is currently the only rare earth mining company in north america, and controls almost the entire remaining 15%. As you may know, the US, as well as many other countries, has been trying to be more financially independent from china, and the Pentagon recently gave MP materials funding to expand mining in california. The global market for rare earth materials is expected to 10x by 2025 and with relations shaky between China and the US along with other major countries this means that the rest of the world cannot rely on just china for these extremely important materials and even if relations are repaired with China, they won't be able to supply even close to 85% of the global supply in the future. This means there has to be a significant amount of the market controlled by north america by 2025, and MP materials is the only option for north america because new competitors will be years behind MP as it takes at least a year just to gain permits, let alone scale the company into a large enough one to compete with an established company like MP that has the support of the US government. With the global market expected to rise into the hundreds of billions and MP in a position to gain a large portion of the market over the next couple years, this is a once in a generation opportunity similar to investing in the only north american oil company as the first oil combustion vehicles were rolled out in the late 19th century. MP IPOd just this year and many people aren't even aware they are public. They are trading at around $30 with just a $5.16B market cap as of market close on Tuesday, and have just seen a nice dip in price in just the last week after nearly tripling over the last 2 months. This is the perfect opportunity to invest in the EV industry as a whole and a company that could be sitting well over 100B within just the next few years. In other words,

Title: EV play - Magna $MGA
I'll keep this fairly brief. 

**intro**

Magna is the third largest car part manufacturer in the world, behind Bosch and Denso. Those don't trade in murica. Bosch is not solely focused on car parts, but sells slightly more (~50bn compared to ~40bn at Magna). 

Currently trades at a 0.70 price to sales ratio. And a relatively ripe PE of around 48.

They're primarily focused on chassis, powertrain, body, seating, and now, more excitingly, driver assistance, electronics, and lighting systems. Coming in 2022, they announced a new camera system as well, which I presume is one of many new developments coming to adapt to the continuous increased tech in cars.

They also advertise themselves as a mobility technology company, realising that not only people will need to be transported, but goods as well. They mentioned e bikes in their conference call, but I don't see why they wouldn't be able to transition to transport trucks even though it seems their main focus is light vehicles currently.

Their chief tech officer is becoming the CEO in 2021.

**Growth opportunities**

As mentioned, the mobility space. Transport of all kinds.

Further, their JV. They have a fairly strong position in China. This year, of course, Europe, North America, and China car productions haven't grown too much, but Magna's revenue has only decreased by a few %.

It seems they like taking the JV approach. They have a few in China currently, namely BJEV, Hongli, GJT, etc. Although GJT has had impairment recorded this year, in the call they still sounded optimistic. The write down is just an adjustment to previous accounting entries.

Two new partnerships with LG and Fisker seem like the start of a further expansion into the EV space.

Magna can help all these new EV companies outsource their needs, and continue to manufacture new tech and enter new vehicle markets.

The political landscapes in Europe and Asia seem favourable for Magna as well, as there is a stronger push towards EV as everyone knows. Their latest quarterly report for example shows 10% year over year growth in production of light vehicles in China. 

**financials**

Last q revenue of $9bn was only down 2% yoy, mainly due to Europe volumes, with profit of 400mil.

Healthy balance sheet, imo, with a current ratio of about 1.3 and a manageable amount of LTD. 

Solid cash flow from operating activities.


TLDR: through partnerships and joint ventures, and entering new areas such as goods transportation and other mobility, along with continuing to provide parts and new tech for light vehicles, Magna seems well positioned for the next few years.

PT: might be able to crawl up to over 1 price to sales in the next year or two. 

I'd play something 80+ strike for June 2021, or wait til further strikes are available.

Title: NMGRF - Graphite Mining Company with huge positive outlook
Hey there, Dudes and Dudines, Autists and Retards!

There's been some DD over on r/pennystocks and I thought i might share this with you since this company seems to do a really good job.

[Nouveau Monde Graphite](https://nouveaumonde.group/about-us/#our-value-proposition) is a Company engaged in mining Graphite. They're just starting up now, building factories etc. and have a huge area of about 9x9 miles (with 100% ownership) to mine. In this area the ground is expected to have a big percentage (ca. 4.5%) of Graphite, and they expect to soon ramp up their production to 100k tons (100000000kg) of Graphite per year. With an estimated total amount of 59.8M tonnes (59800000000kg) in that area. 

Their goal is to be the first north American company to mine Carbon neutrally and thus create the greenest batteries. They do so with new technology too complicated for me to understand but it's definitely good, use hydro-energy as energy source and are located near a port and in an industry centre with railwork and good street infrastructure and have trading agreements with 40 countries all around the world already.

Right now they're building up their factories and laboratories, and will start going big next year. Look it  up yourself on the website for more information. 

Since they will supply lithium-ion batteries, have such amounts of graphite in the area and the EV revolution, they will inevitably grow a lot.

The guy over on pennystocks predicted an about 5x increase in the next few months, with a total of up to 130x gains from this stock in 2-3 years. They're being traded at about 0.9 per share now.

TL;DR: Graphite company that delivers Battery stuff for EV revolution with huge potential, right now in build up. big gains in next few years. Buy the dip.

Title: HUYA is ridiculously undervalued
Huya is one of the largest Chinese streaming service that focuses on both live gaming and video streaming.

Why am I bullish? FINANCIALS 
Revenue last 4qrts: $1.6bn
Net income: $789 million.
Current market cap: $4.5bn

Lets compare this to the bae that is PLTR
Revenue last 4qrts: $1bn
Net Income: -$1bn
Current market cap: $43bn

Lets recap, Huya is worth 1/10 of PLTR but has 50% more revenue and is a fully profitable operation. In the last few months funds like Morgan Stanley, Ark, Fidelity have been scooping up shares like a mofo.

ZipCharlie on Youtube does an excellent video discussing the recent downtrend and the factors around it. This wont stay this cheap for long 

Title: Its a Boomer play, but its guaranteed money: $GE Leaps
 So, this DD isn't actual TA. It is a series of (what I believe) are **very** safe assumptions: a combination of political analysis, energy trends, and inevitable nation-wide "**must have**" investments. WARNING: this is long. By necessity, one assumption leads to another. I'll give you the **one sentence TLDR** up front, but because this is an assumption-chain, I encourage you to read this post

\----

TL/DR: 

**In order for Biden to get a quick win for what is looking like unfavorable (to Dems) 2022 midterms, he will first shoot for a massive infrastructure bill. Either way Georgia goes, Dems won't blow up the filibuster. Therefore, if he wants to have any "green" policies in his first term, he has to make it super amenable to Republicans. (1) Connecting \*\*rich\*\* renewable areas (mostly Republican states) by extensive HVDC lines to (2) an enhanced nationwide Grid (HVDC lines) will kill two birds with one stone. This \^ infrastructure is inevitable, either way. $GE is the #1 and only American HVDC provider, 220k workers +. $GE Renewables don't contribute to revenue right now, but HVDC + Wind (which will be yuge) make it a massive discount rn.** 

\-----

I am going to lay down a series of linear assumptions and realities below. I feel like these assumptions are all safe, therefore, it is highly likely that the outcome I describe comes to fruition within the next 4 years. 

1. **EVs are going to see mass adoption**. Every automaker + Apple is trying to get in on this. BEV advantages are simply too great. It is highly likely that by 2025, 30% or more of the U.S. fleet will be electric. This will only continue to 2030. 

2. **This will cause big increases in demand on the grid**. Go google around: Grid owners are ecstatic about this. The average American home uses \~33 kWh of energy per day. I own a model 3, and BARELY drive (i dont commute) and still use \~10kWh per day for driving. A commuter may use around 30-35 kWh per day just to drive. By 2025, if \~30% of the U.S. fleet is electric, that'll cause a significant increase in grid demand. More important, though, is that energy generation investment takes time. Grid owners know this is coming. They will beef up generation faster and faster as the U.S. economy becomes more **electrified** instead of based on fossil fuels. 

3. **Added capacity is likely to be green**. This has 2 causes. (1) Finance: Coal isn't cost competitive with solar and wind anymore. Solar is getting very, very cheap and more and more efficient. Offshore wind is having a renaissance. Nuclear is greener, but more expensive (\~$4,200 per kW), and NIMBYism will prevail. Solar/wind + batteries is cheaper than $4,200 per kW right now. Additionally, Alaskan oil can't even get bank financing now, and Coal isn't expanding. People see the end is near. (2) Politics. Dem administration for the next 4 years, and green energy isn't the political football it was 10 years ago. Fighting renewables isn't the focus of the right anymore. Additionally, Democrats resist natural gas expansion: remember the Keystone pipeline? Natural gas is pretty green and cheap af, but its not everywhere, and I deem it unlikely that population centers (NE Corridor, Cali, Chicago, etc etc) are going to be OK with more and more natural gas plants. I deem it unlikely that we're gonna be a 50%+ natural gas country. 

4. **Biden will do an infrastructure bill**. This will happen. Its popular, its needed, and its perfect for his huge desire to be seen as a bipartisan president. 

5. **Biden will try and include moderate green elements in this bill because he knows he won't get green policies otherwise**. Even if the two Georgia seats go blue, there is \*\*ZERO\*\* chance the Dems blow the filibuster. You have (1) a president that won by a narrow margin, that (2) isn't that popular, (3) who has a bad-looking 2022 midterm, that (4) won't run in 2024 cause hes ancient, with (5) a not-too-popular VP, can't afford to run roughshod over norms and weaken their 2022 prospects. 50-50 plus Kamala casting the deciding vote? Please. Not happening.

6. **Green elements in an infrastructure bill will have to benefit Red states** in order to get passed. We're not gonna get a carbon tax / cap and trade system. We're not gonna get massive oil taxes

7. **A lot of Red states are RICH in renewables**. Look at these maps ([https://www.nrel.gov/gis/solar.html](https://www.nrel.gov/gis/solar.html)) for U.S. solar, and this map ([https://energy.maryland.gov/Pages/Info/renewable/windmaps.aspx](https://energy.maryland.gov/Pages/Info/renewable/windmaps.aspx)) for U.S. wind. What do you notice? For the most part, **there are huge wind opportunities in the Midwest**. **There is huge solar potential across Texas and the South**. Outside of California and Northeast Corridor offshore wind, renewables are concentrated in the Midwest and South. 

8. **Right now, we can't take full advantage of these areas because the infrastructure to transport 2025-2030 sized energy demands to population centers don't exist**. This is key. Right now, the U.S. energy grid is largely disconnected in terms of HVDC lines (high voltage lines capable of transmitting huge amounts of power with minimal loss: it resembles small, little fiefdoms. Google "U.S. HVDC Map" (make sure you're looking at the current ones--not the projections). We don't have that much HVDC infrastructure. In this past, there wasn't a huge emphasis because there wasn't that much need....renewables price efficiency didn't make for THAT compelling of a need, and localized Grid owners made-do with the status quo. **HVDC network improvement is INEVITABLE.** Renewables are too cheap, and the efficiencies inherent in concentrating wind and solar where appropriate are too vast. Right now, as you read this, there is an UNDERSEA Ultra HVDC cable being laid between Australia and Singapore to transport solar power. I shit you not. Europe and China are building vast HVDC and Ultra HVDC lines right now. **Look at this wiki page:** [**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_HVDC\_projects**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HVDC_projects)**. See how many are in Asia/Euro vs the U.S.? Its a fucking joke.** It is extremely unlikely that we're gonna just slap solar and wind where they are sub-optimal, rather than seek greater ROI. Mass HVDC lines are inevitable. 

9. General Electric is the only large American HVDC provider. GE employs 200,000+ Americans. It is literally one of the oldest American companies. It has a super American brand name, and is politically connected. 

10. HVDC is **expensive**. I'm not an expert, but because of NIMBY, its likely that a lot of HVDC will be buried along rail lines (From what I read). HVDC between hundreds of wind/solar fields across the U.S. will need to be built, plus HVDC / Ultra HVDC between renewable zones to NE Corridor, Chicago, California. I'd google around for figures, but basically, its $$$$$$$$$. 

11. **Right now,** General Electric's Renewables sector barely brings in any revenue (17% 2019 revenue, around $15 billion [https://www.statista.com/statistics/245430/revenue-of-general-electric-by-segment/#:\~:text=Aviation%20and%20power%20are%20the,U.S.%20dollars%20one%20year%20before](https://www.statista.com/statistics/245430/revenue-of-general-electric-by-segment/#:~:text=Aviation%20and%20power%20are%20the,U.S.%20dollars%20one%20year%20before).). The new CEO is actually pretty fucking great ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.\_Lawrence\_Culp\_Jr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._Lawrence_Culp_Jr)). He turned Danaher around, and is setting up GE for success. GE has a TON of debt (debt/equity above 6.0), but what will happen to the stock when GE is given absolutely gigantic contracts in order to buff up the U.S. Grid? They really are the only American company with the production/size ability to do this. What happens when the GE Renewables sector grows by 4-5x over the next 10 years? Grid improvements + Wind turbines are going to go up bigly. That $15 billion revenue line item may increase dramatically. 

If you read this far, let me restate that this isn't TA. I don't have strikes for you. I don't know how to value HVDC and Wind over the next decade. However, I have a **STRONG** feeling in my nips that $GE is going to be a major American comeback story, and \^ that political/economic/renewable trends make it exceedingly likely that GE will have huge grid contracts coming up. **How much of this is already baked into the price? I have no idea, but I do know that the big boys don't gamble on Adderall rantings like this, so it probably isn't baked in.** 

I'm using GE to add some safety to my current 100% TSLA portfolio. I encourage you all to pick up at least a few cheap 2022 GE Leaps. I'm buying the furthest out, highest strike calls I can get.

Title: Aphria Inc (APHA): yes it's cannabis, yes it's about to get you high on gains in 2021 
I think most of you already saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k450e6/why_apha_is_set_for_a_50_gain/) by [u/WatAb0utB0b](https://www.reddit.com/user/WatAb0utB0b/) about a month ago. I'm here to tell you what has changed since then. Everything is in these two articles: [Bloomberg](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/30/does-113-for-this-merger-between-two-cannabis-heav/?source=eptyholnk0000202&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article), [The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/30/does-113-for-this-merger-between-two-cannabis-heav/?source=eptyholnk0000202&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article). Because you autists have the attention span of a chimpanzee, I'll give an executive summary.

1. **Juicy merger for super dank weed company**  
On the 16th of December, Aphria and Tilray announced that they will merge to form the 2nd biggest exchange traded company of the cannabis market. They will form under Tilray's ticker, but Aphria stock owners will get a 62% stake in Tilray while current Tilray owners will keep a 38% stake. This will allow them to cut costs and get even stronger financials. The merger is expected to happen in the second quarter of 2021.
2. **Cannabis is still an attractive growth market**  
A lot of people are sceptical for cannabis since the last few years the stock has jumped up and down a few times through cycles of hype and disillusion. This time, all the cards are laid out right. Aphria is based in Canada, Tilray in USA: North-America is getting addicted. Boomer orange man has obstructed the market, but Sleepy Joe loves his cannabis so we're good for atleast the next 4 years.   
It's not just NA either, in the EU medicinal cannabis use and other legal CBD products are getting more and more popular, which implies an enormous growth opportunity. Tilray is already partnered with AB Inbev for CBD drinks and Aphria had acquired a sweet drink company (see last post) so they will fit together perfectly. Year after year, performance improves and astonishing growth rates can be found in financial reports (also see last post).
3. **Stock price is cheap, perfect time to get in**  
I jumped in with that last post a bit prematurely (30 shares @ 8.74), the stock price has gone down more than 20% since then. This is because of [ bears that are shorting the cannabis market massively and losing](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cannabis-short-sellers-now-down-155011384.html?),  $236.9 million total in short interest for APHA . It's time to beat them to the ground once again, like WSB is doing right now with GME.  
Currently APHA is noted at around $7, [analysts](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=apha) predict a median price target of $8.64 in the next year (+24%). None of the analysts are giving negative advice, it's all positive with most of them on a 'buy' advice. All of these advices are pretty conservative, weed stock is pretty volatile so the minute good news comes in through the merger or Biden administration you should expect big gains. I would project the price to reach 2017/2018 prices again if you guys diamond hand the fuck out of this stock.

**TL:DR** I'm passing you guys the boof on this massive gain opportunity. APHA is cheap atm and has good forecasts in the future with upcoming merger and Biden administration (+ worldwide growth opportunities). Let's reach another dimension with this stock. Dedicated emoji's: 

Title: TIME TO BUY GOLD MOTHERFUCKERS
Hey fellow morons,

Im gonna make this simple. Youre a monkey, Im a monkey,and those rich assholes on Wall Street? Fucking monkeys, too. Do you know what that means? Our little tiny monkey brains fucking love shiny shit. 

Speaking of shit, you wanna know what is in the shitter? DXY. THATS RIGHT. THE MIGHTY GREENBACK. Now, I may just be a poor back woods southern monkey, but a weakening dollar means inflated asset prices, ie: the entire-fucking-ty of 2020 minus March. 

Whats the ultimate asset? Nuclear weapons. But we cant buy those, so the next best thing is Gold. Take a look, weve got an opportunity here to become rich, shiny, and GOLD. YOULL BECOME SO GOLD YOULL LOOK LIKE TRUMPS GOLD SHITTER. 

Long story short. GLD or IAU. Shares or Options I dont give a fuck.

Title: Brief Analysis on Commitments of Traders reports
I worked on this yesterday so I figured I'd share. I did some analysis yesterday on the Commitments of Traders weekly report data found [here](https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/HistoricalCompressed/index.htm)

It basically tracks inflows and outflows of commodity and S&amp;P futures, segmented by Dealers, Asset Managers, and Leveraged Funds. 

The theory was that perhaps looking at the Dealer Short Position compared to the 52 or 26 week average could highlight periods when the dealers are going short while everyone else is still long, on the assumption that Dealers have the most information. If true, one could size up/down depending on likelihood of turmoil.

I pulled in all the data, cleaned it, calculated a "Dealer Short Rank" which is their current short position / 52 week average, much like Implied Vol Rank on options, and graphed vs the SPX. 

Ultimately, it was a leading indicator for the 2020 crash and 2008 crash but otherwise did poorly as a leading indicator. See [here](https://i.imgur.com/dNoEFZr.png) for a chart. 

Looking at asset manager / institutional short rank at least does moderately well at identifying 'bottoms' in crashes when it reaches over 150%, as seen in [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/oHEPOTS.png).

Short positions for leveraged funds just look like noise and don't seem insightful. 

There's a bunch of other data there that I haven't looked at yet, but in terms of additional position data as well as all the other commodities and treasuries, so maybe there's an uncovered gem there, but initially seems useless.


**TLDR**: *Can't* easily piggyback on Dealer knowledge to know when to short. *Can* follow Institutional buyers out of a crash though as their buying coincides with the bottom.

Title: GME 1.7 Billion Evaluation My A$$
I ordered a Blacks Ops 4 Pro Edition which retails for $100 for only $29.97 on GameStop. They then sent me a pre owned copy. I requested an exchange and sent back the game.  Two days later I received a refund. Yesterday I received a new copy of the game with a packing slip for earlier this month. This is the second time in 3 months this has happened. How is this company even financially stable when they are giving out free money. 

Thanks GameStop 

Title: CRSR: Why the next earnings report and the PE ratio after is going to be the deciding factor
Ive seen a few DDs on this stock, but all of them have ignored the horrendous PE ratio, which is currently sitting at 85x compared to the average of about 20x for other companies in the industry. Other than this, all the fundamentals are pretty good. I think this is mostly responsible for the large price fluctuations its seeing, and its also giving alot of professional analysts a hard time finding a fair value, some as low as $24 and as high as $60. 

With the holidays and people generally being locked inside, I think its safe to say that the next earnings report will skyrocket compared to the last one. Personally I think CRSR could shoot up to the high 40s or maybe even the mid 50s after earning release, then fall after. I think it may be a good idea to exit shortly after the next earnings report (or maybe shortly before depending on how much the hype is). If you want less risk, buy shares and hold in case earnings goes tits up because this definitely is going to see good long term growth in the next few years. 

TL;DR: Next earnings report will probably lower PE ratio by alot, shooting the price up. Probably a good idea to sell shortly after because it might dip, especially with a good chance the next couple reports will be lower. May re-enter during summer or fall 2021

Title: Hexagon Purus (Hydrogen Fuel Tank Supplier)
From one degenerate retard to another, the hype train of **hydrogen powered vehicles** is already on full speed, but there are still major opportunities for us to cash in and what way to secure your portion by investing in a established company that just had its IPO???

**Hexagon Purus** are a Norwegian company which split off from its parent company **Hexagon Composite** and had its IPO on Monday in Oslo already soaring **40+%**. They provide key parts for Hydrogen storage in vehicles including cars, trucks, busses, plains, trains and boats. Previously they have partnered with Daimler, Hime and have secured a long lasting agreement with **Everfuel** for over 17 Mio .

For your DD here their Investors Information: [https://cdn.hexagongroup.com/uploads/2020/12/Hexagon-Purus-AS-Information-Document-5.pdf](https://cdn.hexagongroup.com/uploads/2020/12/Hexagon-Purus-AS-Information-Document-5.pdf)

So to conclude I'm betting on this for 2021! By the way I'm German and our trading platforms are closed till Monday (So don't disappoint us **and buy some PLTR while you're at it!**)

Einen guten Rutsch ins neue Jahr ihr Gehirnamputierten! (Slide good into the new year you degenerates!)

Title: DD: MT is about to MOON! 
From a daily newsletter Im subscribed to delivered this gift about 2021:

 In the Chinese zodiac, 2021 is the Year of the Ox. This year, the element associated with the ox is metal. For all signs of the Chinese zodiac, the year will bring prosperity and luck in business ventures, as well as wellness.

Free money. Youre welcome.

Title: Palantir (PLTR) is extremely undervalued, here is why.
PLTR is only overvalued by 19%. That ain't shit for a tech stock, most of the tech stocks we talk about here are overvalued by several hundred procent. PLTR has a ton of catching up to do if it wants to be just as overvalued as it's competitors. Lets take a look at Tyler Technologies, a close competitor. Overvalued by 258%. If Palantir also became overvalued byt 258% percent, it would trade at a whopping $73 a share, meaning you easily could tripple your money.

TLDR: Buy Palantir, it's not too late at all.

Title: 100x potential @ NOU &amp; NMGRF
Fellow Autists, welcome to my dd ted-talk.

Graphite. Graphite is used in EVs, solar-panels and way more future-techy bullshit. Projected to have massive shortages as early as 2023, so how can we abuse this trend?

Nouveau Monde Graphite. Cute, Canadian &amp; GREEN. Why does green matter? So that those EV-CEO CUCKS can brag about how green &amp; environmentally friendly their stoopid car is. 

Inserted some cash-flow predictions I made, one using sector-friendly margins &amp; projected production by NMG themselves. The other using actual capital expenditure per ton (projected by NMG) &amp; semi-correct graphite prices.

I know you guys dont care about conservative numbers, so Ill only drop the most extreme profit scenario. 

139. Not 139%, 139x your money. 

Thank me later.

Position: 3000 shares, willing to add way more.

TLDR; Buy NOU, NMGRF or NM9. EZ double your money short term, long term 100x potential.

Monday's market open saw an immediate meltdown and began this   channel and Tuesday saw us drip below our $25 [support zone](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/supportandresistance/). After the Dec 7th run-up   tried pulling us below $25 on the 10th and 16th, but we held the line. The 9 day MA trading below the 20 day MA suggests to me that this trend will continue in the short term. [PLTR ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-PLTR/)is currently bouncing off the lower BB and against the upper crayon line I drew, the next pop is going to be volatile AF. If at market open we don't hold the fuck'n line, I believe that we'll probably gap down to the $20-$22 range.  


Personally, I think the trend is pointing that we'll finish the year below $25. This doesn't really bother me much, in the near term we have 2 catalyst dates in January and hype leading up to their [earnings](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/fundamental/) call on the 11th of Feb.

Title: Luminar Technology to the Moon
Alright retards this is not no pump and dump scheme this is a dump then pump for LUMINAR! Get some fucking free tendies for this company come on now.

Today it closed around $32.36 BUT after hours right now are currently trading around $34-$34.80.

Tesla was testing new sensors and was rumored to have LUMINAR sensors on them. 

" The implication, if it isn't clear, is that Tesla might be testing Luminar's sensors. If true, that would be [big news](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/29/why-luminar-technologies-stock-jumped-today/) for a couple of reasons."

Then it goes to quality control of this lidar company. 

 "[Luminar](https://www.trefis.com/stock/lazr/articles/505626/is-velodyne-or-luminar-stock-the-better-bet-on-the-self-driving-market/2020-12-29), on the other hand, is focused on building sensors that can be used in mass-market vehicles. The companys sensors are expected to hit the sweet spot for automakers, costing under $1,000 per unit while offering very strong performance relative to their price."

While we have bearish Velodyne producing high cost yet high quality sensors. 

"Based on cumulative shipments and revenue data from the companys form S-1, its sensors cost an average of $14k per unit."

Who the fuck wants to pay an extra 13k for their sensors? Lamborghini wouldn't even want to invest into these high costly ass sensors. Tesla would then look for other technology WHICH IS LUMINAR because of a $13,000 difference. 

These new electric vehicles that are coming to the market to compete with Tesla will look for a high marginal benefit of sensors which would be Luminar for the price alone. 

STOP SLEEPING GET YOUR TENDIES! 

I have $50 calls for February.

Title: Part 1: Bull Case for BP (Industry Trends)
**TLDR: Buy BP. Undervalued assets. Short-term COVID recovery play (2x increase) and long-term opportunity in the transition to clean energy (5x increase). Expertise in hydrogen and solar. Second time's the charm for 'Beyond Petroleum'.** 

Had to dig up a really old account in order to post on WSB ugh - apparently accounts &lt; 1 month old are automatically banned from WSB -.-. Previously posted on ViacomCBS here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kmb3ry/viac\_bull\_case/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kmb3ry/viac_bull_case/)

This is the first in a series of posts on my bull thesis for BP. I'll break down my analysis into short-term and long-term expectations. In my first post, I'll cover industry trends and explain why there is still a bull case for legacy energy firms like BP. I will follow up over the next few weeks detailing my short-term and long-term thesis for BP. 

# Introduction

**The global energy market has increased more than 7 fold since the 1950s**, and is expected to **grow by up to 2x over the next 3 decades**. The majority of said growth is expected to come from **emerging markets** including Brazil, India, China, and Africa. However, despite the growth in energy demand, **oil and gas firms have been lagging behind in returns** vis-a-vis the rest of the NASDAQ. Brent crude has fared even worse. 

**Regulatory push** coupled with an **increase in the social consciousness of climate change** are the primary reasons for slow growth in oil and CNG. This is especially true in developed countries. Global demand for clean energy is expected to grow by up to 8% CAGR over the next decade. In addition, renewables can be as cheap as if not more affordable than crude or gas. 

https://preview.redd.it/7as924qor9861.png?width=2096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9efb086bf0f7b12367f3214b8adf9f6130f7856

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, **prices for crude has fallen by more then 50% since November 2019** (when the Lazard research was published). At one point in time, oil futures were negative - large amounts of unconsumed of brent crude and CNG cost producers money to store, and oil tankers piled up on coasts and in the open seas. 

# The future of energy

So is the future of 100% energy renewables? Not quite. **Energy storage continues to be a massive PITA for most municipalities**. Lithium ion cells are extraordinarily expensive and bulky. Unconventional storage techniques (e.g. using bricks, dams, etc) are also pricey. **While there has been a breakthrough in energy production, there hasn't been a breakthrough in energy storage**. Despite the numerous claims recently by firms such as Nanotech in graphene batteries and the like, there remains one major problem - scalability. In fact, this is a problem that has plagued energy scientists and battery engineers over the past 2 decades - anyone can produce graphene cells, but nobody can figure out how to do so at scale. **Energy is consumed consistently, but clean energy cannot be produced constantly.** 

[Energy consumption \(day vs night\)](https://preview.redd.it/b4s3bpn2u9861.png?width=599&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b27992309519f4ab395c74f0c8ba143c1d23dc6)

&amp;#x200B;

[Wind speeds variability in month of December](https://preview.redd.it/n6jelzseu9861.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=173d8fd02111bf27468bdfbc425ebd53ae9bd4dc)

Of course, solar energy can only be produced in the day, and not at night. This means that during lull periods of energy production (e.g. at night when wind speeds don't support energy production), energy solutions that are not dependent on environmental factors (hydrocarbons - HCRs) need to kick in (unless energy storage is available). But **the cost of energy storage + renewable energy production is still far greater (1.5 to 3x depending on region) than the cost of traditional hydrocarbons**. 

In addition, the inability to store renewable energy affordably and compactly means that it is **not a viable form of energy for high-duration industrial and transportation activities - e.g. shipping, air travel etc**. Therefore, it would be illogical to assume that traditional hydrocarbons would not have a role to play over the next few decades. 

Today, the **cost of energy = cost of production + cost of regulations or taxes**. If the cost of climate change were to be internalized in the cost of CNG or crude oil production, the cost of legacy energies is bound to be higher than that of alternatives. 

However, regulations are not imposed nor are they enforced globally. This means that **countries without a climate change mandate will be inclined to go for the cheapest possible energy source** to fulfill their energy needs. Read: most developing nations. Given that the **cost of energy = cost of production for countries without strong climate change regulations**, there continue to be demand for legacy energies in developing nations. That's BRICS (ex China) = 2.5Bn+ people by 2030. 

Therefore, demand for polluting energies such as CNG and oil will continue to increase (albeit marginally) over the decade despite a spike in interest and demand for clean energy. **Developing nations would simply displace developed nations in the consumption of legacy energies**. 

**We have not reached peak oil demand; we're just at the bottom of a cycle.** Contrary to popular belief, **demand for oil/gas will not collapse**. In fact, global demand for liquid fuels is expected to **increase by up to 6.3% in 2021**. 

# Part 1 Conclusion

Here, I've laid out my case for liquid fuels and legacy oil companies as part of the COVID-19 reopening trade (which is pretty duh). I'll expand on this in my next post, and explain why BP is a better buy compared to its peers, both in the short term (&lt;1Y) and the long term.

Title: NOVA TO THE MOON
This stock may not be as exciting as yalls fancy SPACS and shit but this is a for sure play and I will tell yall why.

I have been in the residential solar industry for over 3 years in NJ working from a salesman all The way up to VP of sales for one of the largest installers in the country running a team of 30 guys. For three of the 4 companies I have worked for while moving my way up in the solar world we have used sunnova for our financing. 

Sunnova is a financer for solar which allows customers to get solar for $0 out of pocket and see savings right away as sunnova collect sure money from federal tax credits and state solar incentives. The profit margins for these contracts for residential solar when sold direct to consumer is absolutely ridiculous. For instance I now average about $6k per residential solar contract which I sign and sunnova makes much more than that in the long run.

Despite covid leaving their sales teams essentially laid off for half this year sunnova is up 30% year over year in revenue! and has increased the amount of solar installers that they contract through significantly which will be huge once covid settles even more and people are back out selling.

And that is where my dd really comes in. One thing that I understand that many of the investors of this company do not is that this is a company powered largely by direct sales including door to door which has been an industry fucked up hard by this virus and is always slower during these colder months as well.

Sales people in this industry are dying to get back out and make some money again once these vaccines roll out as they should. But even if they dont it will still grow as it has been. 

The other thing that makes this an absolute for sure bet is that the market for residential solar is only growing and EXPONENTIALLY. The reason for this is that every year they open up in more states as states continue to create incentive programs for solar. Right now they service in 20 states by the end of the year I guarantee they will be in 5-10 more. The federal tax credit being extended alone will ensure they expand to new states and territories.

It is simple as the fact that the more states they are in the more people they get their contracts in front of the more they make and QUICKLY.

This is going to be a for sure medium to long term hold. This should go up come February earnings but I dont expect anything crazy since covid has still been affecting sales a bit but once the may earnings come around this thing is going to the MOON Sunnova is a direct competitor with SUNRUN which has already had massive runs. Even though NOVA is up big since IPO it is not just hype this stock is sure to climb. This company will be one of the biggest solar companies in solar for years to come.

I currently hold quite a bit of stock in Sunnova but as of now calls are too overpriced for me I will be waiting on calls till I have a good feeling I can time something short term. 

At the end of the day all you need to know is that this dip is the opportunity of a lifetime. If you would like to double your money just put all your money in sunnova and wait till may you will thank me then

Title: PSTH Possible Target: Chick-Fil-A
  

My bet is that PSTH goes for Chick-Fil-A

*Chick-fil-A sports a market share gain of more than twice as much as runner-up Chipotle Mexican Grill. The chain, which doesnt open on Sundays, leapt over such stalwarts as Taco Bell and Subway to become the third highest-grossing chain in the country, behind McDonalds and Starbucks, according to Restaurant Business Magazine.* *(Aug 2020)*

Chick-Fil-A is one of the best and fastest-growing fast-food chains. Sales have rose form $3.2B '09 to $11.9B '19. I mean have you seen how efficient their drive-through system is during peak hours??? They sit valued at just around a $5B valuation (low end of the SPAC range, which means they have room to pay more if needed). Along with sporting 2,664 US locations (Scapehero), they have some international locations in Canada and the UK. 

This checks off simple predictable free cash flow &amp; assumes at least a decent balance sheet. With those revenues, there should not be much need for other capital markets funding and they sport a large market cap of $5B. There is a lot of competition between the fast-food chains making it tough to enter, also there are not many extrinsic factors other than the occasional pandemic/random cities &amp; places banning your restaurant threatening Chick-Fil-A. It is well run and consistency between franchises confirms that. As for an attractive valuation, I have no clue lol.

Finally, most of Bill's portfolio is food-based already... Chipotle, Starbucks, QSR (which owns Tim Hortons, Burger King, Popeyes). Popeyes can be seen as a possible conflict of interest and I guess sandwiches like (Subway/JerseyMikes) could complement this portfolio well. So with that, Subway definitely is not out of the conversation.

Possible cons:  Religious aspects of Chick-Fil-A could be looked at as extra baggage. Owning QSR, which owns a competitor Popeye's, could pose some issues?

Other possible targets: Subway, Impossible Foods, Meijer, Stripe (wet dream), Gingko Bioworks, Marqeta, others that I do not know.

# TL;DR 85C 1/15/2021

**300C 2023**

Good evening WSB. I've concluded developing my portfolio for the year and have some time to discuss Pinterest as a strong growth investment. After a lot of debate and research, Pinterest is my favorite investment possibly ever. In a way, Pinterest sort of feels as if Amazon had been reborn and built by women's economic interests. It's totally phenomenal and I think this company will reach a 200B valuation sooner rather than later.

# - Pinterest is 400m+ MONTHLY active users, where 70-80% of them are women. That is incredible userbase to have where incentives can quickly follow. THAT'S HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF WOMEN FFS

**- These users are seek high quality content and use the application with the intention to discover new idea to try.** **That is a transnational product space to own.** For example, searching for "Rihanna Fenty lipstick" will soon have you seated in front of a digital camera with product filters. They are only a few months away from applying the same technology to haircuts and other sorts of shopping digital shopping assets. **My god damn mother is 52 and uses pinterest for SEWING IDEAS IN MEXICO MY DUDES.**

[Pinterest DOMINATES the social media shop](https://preview.redd.it/j41w18zj29861.png?width=1255&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27c125b750c1747ba3acc3714b944b2ad6e5e161)

\- **Advertisers will pay top dollar for this advertising space and will continue to punch upwards as a global marketing platform.**

**- Other platforms benefit from Pinterest.** Zoom, Etsy, Adobe, and Target integrations will benefit from these products and sits among an influential realm of companies. **You will see this logo more and more often seated next to Twitter and Facebook.**

&amp;#x200B;

\- It has an incredibly high-quality **search engine for** **ideas**. This search trait is a common search asset of Google because Google's SEO architecture. It's a complex web of decisions that Pinterest fulfills commonly sought content from Google users. A common search trait  "food near me" type searches. Another is "Thanksgiving stuffing".  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\- Google searches for companys that often deliver high quality images, fast delivery of content, and other important internet quality demands. Google's SEO explains why including "Reddit" in a question will provide excellent answers. In the same vein, I believe Google is pushing web standards aggressively through its Chrome dominance and **Fastly** will benefit from such a shift.

Title: ARKG: blasphemy
This is gonna rub some people the wrong way. 

If you are sensitive or disagree with me please do one of the followings: a. Stop reading. b. attack me personally. c. downvote. d. go long on ARKG

ARK is way over blown here and people worship Cathy Wood because she has been a Tesla for years. I'm here to give you some sobering info because stocks don't care who owns them. I'm not here to fanaticize Cathy. I'm here to make money. 

Cathy was on Bloomberg pumping genetic stocks and talking up her book a few weeks ago. Simpleton investors started pouring money in her fund ARKG so much that created a short-squeeze in some of the underlying assets:

Here is the chart for Editas after her pump:

 

https://preview.redd.it/mt0gzzfxf8861.png?width=443&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c586bd9066dcd7bf0315c17e16e9536e93f7bd4b

Looking at Crispr: it has a market cap of 11 B. ARKK owns 1B and ARKG owns 0.5B of it. That's about 14% of the company. Now that wouldn't be an issue but here is the problem. ARK is building it's position in those companies too quickly. Buying a significant portion of the float while pumping the stocks leads to other investor buying in too. This creates a feedback loop of price going up. People seeing that value of ARKG and CRSP is going up and putting more money in and then ARKG is forced to buy at a more inflated price and this positive feedback loop created an unsustainable pump. Following is Crispr chart:

**Here is the rub**: the cycle continues so long as money is coming into ARKG. But the **pump is running out of steam**. See below how fund flows into ARKG is dropping.

So What I'm saying is I think the pump was fun while it lasted. I shorted EDIT, CRSP. Also I opened a bearish position on the entire ARKG:

Title: GME battle of the autistics vs hedge fund shorts. Threshold securities edition.
Being an autistic I did some digging on [threshold securities.](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/threshold-securities) **Any stock being naked shorted will show up on the list and will persist until those shares are covered.** The day this first appeared on the list? [December 8th, which just happens to be the date earnings dropped for Q3.](https://imgur.com/Y6s5r9h) Well they had of covered by [now right? LOL Nope.](https://imgur.com/SBjY6wO)

Well who cares right? Being a stuck in the basement while my wife and her boyfriend rehearse the scene in the casting couch, I looked if this happened in the past. It did, on September 22, 2020 till [October 8, 2020](https://imgur.com/IkiT9xi). October 8th did get some [Microsoft news](https://www.windowscentral.com/gamestop-strikes-multiyear-deal-microsoft-cloud-surface-and-xbox-all-access) which caused the spike but with it naked shorts probably did close out their positions. But what about this time? Well on [Dec 22th we saw a huge 25%](https://imgur.com/T1DykxH) run up, this means they covered out their naked shorting right? [Nope](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities) they didn't. It's still on the list. Even if it wasn't on the threshold securities list, I'd say the short interest had to [of stayed flat or gone higher.](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) Which also means that big 25% run up on December 22th wasn't a short covering but huge buyers coming in and not Ryan Cohen.

So what am I getting to now? From what I've dug up, at some point when they are forced to close out their naked shorts (not talking about their regular 68M short position) and is no longer on the threshold security list, **GME can still easily gap up +30% in a day.**

For everyone saying it'll never squeeze as GME has been shorted for years. You are correct its been manipulated for years but unlike then we got [Ryan motherfucken Cohen](https://whalewisdomalpha.com/rc-ventures-increased-gamestop-stake/) covering our backs.

PS. Fuck all the shills and  . Don't get fooled by their digital sales &gt; physical sales trend. What they don't pay attention to is that gaming as a whole is growing as a whole year over year. If sales goes from 100M to 200M, you can skew graphs to make it look like physical gaming is dying when in fact physical games haven't lost traction at all. Also they are comparing end of console sales to the start of super gaming cycle. Get your GME before this MOASS to the fucken next solar system.

Title: DD on LGVW (Soon to be BFLY) the love child of Bill Gates and Cathie Wood
LGVW is a SPAC that has a definitive merger agreement with Butterfly Network a company that makes portable, easy to use, and affordable ultrasound devices that attaches to your phone. There are some other similar products like it, but butterfly's ultrasound device is the cheapest and also one of the highest rated (just search it up on youtube and you'll see tons of videos from doctors saying how great it is).

At current valuations at $20 per share for LGVW butterfly network is valued at about $3B. Three points for my bull case:

1) The founders and owners envision a future where every man and woman in the world can have this ultrasound device just like a smartphone. If someone thinks there is something wrong with them, they can just do a little scan, send the results to a doctor and the doctor can just message the results back

2) The usual ultrasound devices are very expensive and cost tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars, are clunky, hard to move and are not instant. Many undeveloped countries don't have the luxury to afford such devices, so there's a lot of opportunity for expansion here

3) Subscription service for cloud storage, ML, and on site training services


I first became interested in this company when I saw that ARK was buying the spac week after week and that bill gate's foundation is an early investor. This isn't one of those EV companies with no product or vaporware, they actually manufacture something that can revolutionize the healthcare industry. 

The merger is expected to complete by the first quarter of 2021, and I don't think the upside for this company has been fully realized yet.

Disclosure: I am currently holding warrants and shares of LGVW

Title: GME Gang, don't let Robinhood lend your shares to the shorts and Melvin! DD inside for more tendies
For y'all holding GME in your Robinhood margin accounts, **don't!** Robinhood [earns a lot of its money](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/how-robinhood-makes-money/) from lending securities from margin accounts to shorts, and unlike other brokers, doesn't share this income with you! And if you're unsure if you have a margin account or not, [by default](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/robinhood-accounts/), you have a margin account. Keep options and whatever other not crazily shorted shit in your RH account, but for stuff like GME, why make it easy for Melvin? 

So what can you do to screw over those greedy shorts who have manipulated GME for far too long? Either switch your Robinhood account to a cash account (but then no more instant deposits), or if you still want those instant deposits, move over your GME holdings to another broker like Fidelity or Schwab with a non-margin account. 

Best of all, if you buy from some toilet paper hands on Robinhood that get scared off on days like today, then you're helping fortify the front line! Imagine if WSB can take another 1-2% of the float away from shorts! 

Less supply -&gt; more fees for shorts -&gt; more covering -&gt; 

Let's show Wall Street just how creative and unrelenting us WSB degenerates can be!! DIAMOND HANDS TO TENDIE TOWN  ** **

im using Fidelity desktop/iphone, Stockcharts dot com, WSB, r/investing, news outlets w/associated keywords, and just reading back nforth but not sure when to pull the trigger. Right now ive only $750 ready to go and I go back nforth on MT (i work in metal fab/weld) an wait for ERs on 1/11/2021 or PSTH and hope for that purchase/merger of ??? turns out as good as i guess but, i have yet to look up and see Bill Ackmans history and how good he is at what he does.

So how do you determine enough is enough ? What do you use ?

Title: DD PSA: How to avoid getting fooled by a company like Nikola again
Alright, knuckleheads. I know this isn't school, so I'll try to make this easy to understand and impart some of my limited aCtUaL kNoWleDgE upon this community in return for all you've given me.

NKLA happened, and NKLA will happen again. There's a million ways to slice, dice, and wife profits off a meme stock like that, but my favorite way to create a long forecast on a fast-rising techie company is to **look at the company's IP holdings**.

Companies (especially startups growing out of diapers and getting ready to shit the bed) have great incentive to patent anything and everything they can. Patents prove the company is working on R&amp;D, hired competent people, and has legal chops hovering feverishly. It gives them license to wave their dick around in the market space. Nikola's IP portfolio can be likened to Trevor Milton's bulge: ^(it's) ^(tiny.)

There are three easy "types" of patents.

1. Granted: "real". Legally sound. Valid for 20 years.
2. Pending: not "real", can turn real, valid for like a year.
3. Design: for design. Apple has many. Nikola needs none.

Nikola has like 9 patents (a minuscule amount for a company of its former stature) and almost all of them are design, or "D" patents. D patents are for Jonny Ive and the ghost of Steve Jobs' OCD. If a small company like Nikola or whatever goddamn meme stock you want to suck off this week has majority D patents, take a page out of Forrest's book and run. **You want a company with a history of turning pending patents into granted ones.** Even if it's a "new" company splooging all over the scene, I guarantee they've been producing IP for eons. If they haven't, that's a red flag big enough to cripple Lana Rhoades. If it breaks her, I fucking promise it'll break your margin account too. 

Patents should be

1. of the same volume as comparable companies in your meme stock's size and market space and
2. aligned with what the company says it's doing

Patents are forward-thinking documents. Companies want them to be viable and maybe even cutting edge 5, 10, 15 years down the line. You know what doesn't stay current for that amount of time? The design of a semi. Vehicles get redesigned year-to-year and substantially about every 5. You know what Trevor Fuckton decided to patent? A bunch of useless design patents protecting the contours on his DOA load of gravity-defying shit. And guess what? His company is garbage. Patents are a huge tell. **Good news for you addicts: NIO has a normal-looking patent portfolio.** Are they good quality? I'm not gonna look. But maybe you can.

**TL;DR since I know you want one:** My bidet's control panel is protected by more patents than Nikola has to its name. That's never a good sign. Do your dd. Love you idiots.

Title: WISH is a Sleeping Giant 
Listen up, you fucking retards. I shouldnt even be doing this, Im practically in here giving away free money at this point. Thats the kind of guy I am though, Im one charitable motherfucker. Im the most charitable motherfucker, so listen here and you might just be able to earn the respect of you lost on shitty EV plays.

Everyone I know buys their dildos on wish. Now I this isnt just anecdotal. Theres mountains upon mountains of well-documented evidence which suggests that 75% of women have purchased and used a dildo during the pandemic. Why!?! 

Because women are fucking horny and men are all pathetic little shits that cant satisfy a woman and their urges. 

51.1% of the world population happens to be women. 38.75 is 50% of 75. That means that wish dildos are going into 38.75% of all pussies in the world . Right now. At this moment. Even your mom. Your sister. Your grandmother. You tracking yet? More importantly, theres another study from Sanford that suggest that every 38 seconds someone is masturbating or gets the urge to masturbate.

...Which might give the dildo market  an even higher valuation in tesla. This is an untapped well of potential. 

Imagine 5 years from now? A man in every tesla a and a pink tentacle dildo made of temper glass in every woman. You cant stop it.

Betting against wish is a bet against pussy. Never bet against pussy. Cowards.

Title: $MP - MP Materials DD
Did some DD on MP today and I realized something. 

Based on MPs 8-K, they currently only realize $3.74/kg for their Rare Earth Ore (REO). 
https://i.imgur.com/3yk0nlM.jpg

$3393/907kg is $3.74 per kg

This is the current price of Neodymium:
https://i.imgur.com/ymElv6u.jpg
Its in CNY:

607500 CNY for 1 ton
1 usd is 6.53CNY
1 ton is 907kg

This comes out to $103 USD per kg at todays prices.

This is a revenue multiplier that is going to be HUGE for MP once they have  processing capabilities in 2023.

I realize that there will be loss in processing, but they are also not yet at capacity. Plus the increased demand of neodymium magnets for EVs will further drive up price.

Look at the rise of neodymium price this year (chart above). The demand is so high, China is buying literally all of MPs REO because they cant keep up with the demand. 

This is the estimates EV demand in the coming decade:
https://i.imgur.com/XKqPigq.jpg

Its scary thinking about how much the price of neodymium will rise based on this demand. 

MP is currently profitable, they have the funds to finish the processing plant, plus they have government backing.

This stock is going to be insane in the coming years.

Title: BBY - Your next 10 bagger

Listen fellow retards, the analysts are sleeping on this stock. It's insanely undervalued. 

&amp;#x200B;

From BBY last earnings call - From a profitability standpoint, our better-than-expected sales resulted in significant operating income rate expansion and earnings growth, stated Best Buy CEO Corie Barry. 

BBY is hands down the best managed retailer out there. So why is the stock tanking for the last 2 months? Because analysts are retarded and things have changed since the last reputable analyst call. Goldman downgraded the stock early december since they don't see how it can continue to grow. Since then, we have had $600 in direct payments AND we might get another $2,000. Last stimulus, majority of it went to durable goods aka electronics. The government wants to straight up give you money to buy PS5 AND Xbox with a 65" TV to go along with it. Good thing BBY sells all of these AND they are preferred for electronics over any other retailers. 

But analysts don't want you to know that. Smart money is already accumulating BBY while you yolo PLTR. 

Here's what 4hour on BBY looks like right now: 

https://preview.redd.it/telh37ss4z761.png?width=999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9cbe2f91589dac3a165fd30cd40fdd8be4304ea

What the fuck do those yellow balls mean? In the most simple terms, it can show accumulation/distribution. So what happens when it squeezes like that? Look at what it did in below examples:

TLDR: BBY is about to break on $2000 stimulus news. The accumulation has already begun. Position: 100x (115C-125c - 0.20, Jan 15)

Title: Sony $SNE is fostering to become a meme stock
Do you ever sit on your couch and act retarded because you missed out on the meme stocks that went to the moon without you? Well I'm here to do some diligent DD for you autists to YOLO your life savings into and upgrade the depressing life you live in.

**The company is Sony $SNE**. 

Some important things to know:

* Sony dominates in 3 major markets; Consumer electronics, entertainment, and telecommunications
* Recently, Sony raised its future earnings outlook on [record-breaking earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/28/sonys-second-quarter-profit-jumps-13point9percent-on-strong-gaming-demand.html)
* Current P/E ratio sits at around 14, with a historic high of 127 (peaking in PS2 release and averaging 80+ shortly after subsequent PS releases) industry average and competitors is currently at about 25.
* Sony also has [many predictable sources of revenue including](https://sonyreconsidered.com/sony-q1-2020-earnings-overview-revenue-2-profits-1-f467dafe5609) a "Financial Services" branch that advises anti-yolo boomer's assets.

Assuming you autists even read this far, lets get into what the future metrics for this might mean.

Lets start with the **Consumer Electronics or the cash guzzling brrrrr machine Playstation** segment. Currently if I want to buy a PS5 and throw my money at our King and money god Kenichiro Yoshida (CEO of Sony) I would have to go through 3rd party. When PS5's hit the market they sell faster than you retards can lose money. In fact, on average [PS5 is outselling Xbox 2-1](https://screenrant.com/ps5-outselling-xbox-series-x-reseller-website/) right now, in addition to that, the Brrrr-virus will cause the game console market to near [$55+ Billion next year](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/multi-billion-dollar-console-gaming-market/). Also, without getting into politics, its also important to know that approximately 10-20% of Stimmy checks will go to buying electronics based on polls. This segment is Sony's cash cow and makes up 30% of their revenue. This number is expected to grow significantly as more consoles are expected to hit the sales floor and is likely to [**exceed the PS2 RECORD 157m**](https://screenrant.com/ps5-order-sales-playstation-ps2-holiday-2020-preorder) **total consoles sold. 200 Million consoles = $90 Billion in sales!!**

Next is the **steady telecommunications segment; hey Boomers, this tendie stonks only go up segment is for you!** This is your home entertainment stuff like T.V.'s, speakers, solutions segments and mobile phone. They have a ton of patents on imaging and sensing products that they license out to keep revenues boring and flat here. This has been their worst performing segment during Covid and in a relatively fast response, they built the "sony electronics corporation", [rebranding their Ericsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Mobile) brand with the goal of significantly decreasing operation costs and bandwagon onto the tech YOLO train.

Finally **the entertainment branch where you autists can laugh, cry, and most importantly tickle your tendies endlessly.** Not including the mad dash to get many licensed PS5 games, Sony's entertainment industry (Columbia pictures) is expected to release a new James Bond No Time to Die and Spiderman 3 in the coming year. Given the shutdown for the last year, the sales in entertainment decreased only 6% thanks to retards like Apple TV+ buying up licensing agreements for Sony's movies and shows. With upcoming hits, and a continued partnership with Apple TV+, revenues are going to quickly recover and even better than before.

**Tldr;** With the growth potential of PS5 alone, Sony should easily be trading at double its P/E of 14 to be closer to its competitors putting the PT at $200+. This does not include the massive shifts that they will be implementing across the org to increase net profits.

I own (250) shares and another (15) Jan 2022 $140 C and dumping more come the new year (for tax reasons).

Good luck retards.

Title: PLUG and FB
PLUG is gearing up for another huge move upward.  on the 1hr chart you can see it consolidating before its next move upward, which if you look at its chart it has a good tendency to do.  also FB seems to me like it can continue higher for quite some time.  idk.  bought calls yesterday and im up a little bit.

Title: Bed Bath to the  and Beyond [Updated DD]
**TDLR with positions below**  
**Overview:**

BBBY is a home improvement retail company that operates through the US and Canada.

**Leadership:**

Mark Tritton (ex target CEO) - I'll quote Jim Cramer- "the **NUMBER-ONE CEO** they could get"

**- successfully transitioned target (TGT) into the digital world and saved TGT shareholders** 

\- remodeled **1800 stores and launched 40 brands** at Target

\- a dive into financials will show you how he's revamping BBBY

**Financials**

Let's start by looking at their 4 year financials: **THEY ARE AWFUL**

https://preview.redd.it/0big4wwyc6861.png?width=867&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68ba420cfcbf36865dabe90327862f0a57008d78

\- decreasing revenue, decreasing profit, increasing SG&amp;A, decreasing and negative net income

**But let's see how the financials have been since Mark Tritton came**

https://preview.redd.it/me0h7rvfb6861.png?width=912&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=662b0efd380aa2ee6eeadb3fa571e9949900baf4

A **COMPLETELY** different story from previous years

\- Revenue growth

\- Racking up Cash

\- Paying off debt

\- EBIT rising

**Notable statements from earnings call**

\- **Strongest earnings in** **2 YEARS**

\- The average age of the customer **decreased by 6 years**

\- Digital revenue up **89%**

\- **MORE SHARE BUYBACKS**

\- cutting dead, unprofitable segments

\- focusing on an omnichannel approach

\- **2 million new customers** online  


**Short Interest -** WSB seems to love burning shorters, so let's try this again.

With a **60% short interest,** this stock is going to **skyrocket** if it sees an optimistic earnings report. As insiders are purchasing shares and retail has been booming recently, this stock could **EXPLODE** at earnings. Last ER it went up around 30% reaching a **high of 25$.**

**Notable Transactions**

\- High volume on the 20$ C expiring jan 15th after earnings

\- Insiders have been buying shares @ 20$

**TLDR**:

Short term, **BBBY will run up before earnings** as it has historically

Long term, **BBBY is posed for a turnaround** similar to that of Target's with excellent leadership and a great vision

**POSITIONS: 1000 Shares, 40 Jan 15 21 C** 

**I've been accumulating shares and will continue to do so below 19. If you do options, make sure to get them dated after their ER on January 8th.**

Title: BBBY to the stratosphere.
Maybe not to the moon but to the stratosphere. BBBY has been doing pretty good lately. Beat expectations last quarter and had a significant increase followed by a decline to current levels, will almost definitely have good earnings come early January. There currently going through a couple of large share repurchase programs, increased cashflow and lots of short interest. Short squeeeeze.

Currently sitting at around $18.5, you can expect $24+ after earnings. 
I'm currently holding a significant amount of shares and $20.50 Jan 15 2021 calls.

Good luck shitheads.

During the Great Recession, at its peak, [120K homes foreclosed in September 2010](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreclosure-crisis.asp). Let's assume that 2.4M of those loans go into foreclosure, and that none of the continued lack of rent payment creates additional knock on effects (conservative given at least 30M Americans aren't paying rent right now). This means that we have 2 years of banks absorbing those losses to get through. While they recently passed the [Fed's stress test](https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/dfa-stress-tests.htm), all this means they aren't going to go bankrupt. Bank margins are still going to be heavily affected.

In 2019, [5.3M homes were sold](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/quick-real-estate-statistics). What do you think is going to happen to home values in 2021 when 50% additional supply is going to be injected into the market? REITs are going to shit the bed as well as your home value. This is going to cause a huge number of strategic foreclosures as additional loans go under water. The [federal government will forgive the tax as long as its your primary residence](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/i982--2020.pdf). There will be no point in keeping your underwater home if you don't have wealth elsewhere.

How is Smart Money going to deal with the above? [They're loading up on bonds](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/current/default.htm). Once enough of you have bought in ([it actually looks like we may have passed this point already](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/current/default.htm)), they're going to rip off the band aid with a massive coordinated selloff of equities. Profits taken on equities combined with bonds increasing in price will be landing pad they need.

Title: Rocketship on the Launchpad and ready to take off, last-minute fire sale on tickets to the moon.
&amp;#x200B;

[BUY the DIP!](https://preview.redd.it/3mee0ng8q5861.jpg?width=790&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de8180a0b591d327b23c1ebaedc6a652c2a07ae8)

Alright fellow Autist, I love all your post on rocketships to the moon and wanted to just share that I believe this one is headed there tomorrow morning when it starts trading under the new symbol RMO. If you don't know about Romeo Power look it up, this isn't vaporware, this is a real company.  Yes, it is overvalued given their current sales numbers, but EV vehicles need batteries, plain and simple.  This stock hit 39 yesterday morning and has since been dropping to allow for more passengers onboard its ship, don't miss the sale.

Title: Bridgetown Holdings
I don't have the time for a full DD on this one, but I think this will be a good play if all things align. ticker BTW.N (minus the dot of course)

This is a Thiel backed SPAC that is currently targeting Tokopedia. Now the risk here is that the deal never materializes since it hasn't been officially announced in any way and there is talk of an IPO, but i'm willing to take a punt. 

I am posting this on a pullback day as recent commentary is that DDs are being posted at ATH or after it has run up 100-300%. Yes this is up about 50% in the past week or so, but I do think we could see $20 in the next 2 weeks if the rumours persist. If the Tokopedia deal ever happens, we could be looking at $30-$40 easy pre-merger.

Tokopedia is trying to be the Amazon/Sea Ltd of Indonesia and border countries, if you haven't seen world populations recently Indonesia is the 4th largest country. These are countries that Amazon will never fully penetrate, they don't see it worth their time and people don't trust them. Direct competition is SEA's shopee.

SoftBank, Google, and Alibaba have all invested big $$$ at some point in the past 3 years.

Title: Why Coca Cola ($KO) Is Your Next Ticket To Tendie Town
 

Alright my fellow autists. I know that plenty of you are tired of the pump and dumps and want to see some tendies after the new year. Im gonna hit you with a boomer stock with a spicy mix:  
$KO Coca Cola

We all know Coke has been reliable with its returns for decades though why should you dump the remaining amount of your end-of-year Wendys bonus on a Buffett stock and how do we rack in reliable tendies? Heres the deal: Coca Cola was fucking spit-roasted by COVID. Were still in a 10% slump since March Madness and its slowly crawling its way back. Heres the kicker: Coffee. KO has done a great job pivoting declining soft drink sales to bottled water (flavored and unflavored) and juices which keeps boomers sipping on Santas Coke-filled teets . 

Whats on the horizon is canned/bottled coffee and shit is going to boom.

https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/ready-to-drink-rtd-coffee-market-100285

It is the largest growing sector of non-alcoholic beverages with people seeking a cheaper alternative to the shitty local canned cold-brew and expensive Starbucks options. Cold brew took off as a healthier alternative to dairy/sugar bombed beverages and it saw a huge push (even Coors is making one). 

Coke is releasing its coffee-infused zero calorie soda in January and its already seen success with coffee reviewers and the company adjusted the recipes to better match what people wanted (more flavoring, less coke, more coffee). With the coffee market essentially going to the lowest bidder over the last five years, you can expect a company as large as Coke to have massive buying power with this coffee-infused soda as an introduction to something bigger. Also, with their experience in zero-calorie sweeteners, people will swarm an easy grab-and-go alternative to their Starbucks 600 calorie latte if tastes as good with zero calories as we try to get rid of these COVID waistbands. Whats better? KO thrives on bar culture; it makes enormous sales from cocktails and peoples tastebuds have moved dramatically to cocktails during COVID and theyre gonna be itching for something for more KO-filled drinks the second they can get back to clubs and bars.  
Whats better? Options are incredibly cheap. Im all in with $KO 3/19/21 55c and expecting to be deep in the money come March due to natural rebalancing post-COVID, a resurgence in bar consumption, and add on any coffee for icing on the cake. The fact these options are so cheap astounds me.  Ive made 10% while writing you this cheat sheet (insert rocketships here)

Title: Non meme plays since yall keep losing so much on meme plays
The most boomer of plays is the utility stock and its a missed opportunity here. These stocks generally underperform the market due to their low risk, but their dividends are nice so people buy them. But while I would not hold the underlying shares, the calls in this do so well if you can time the play. And I think its just about time where utilities are primed to go off...like 10%.

Why the fuck would you want to buy something that goes up 10% when you all keep chasing 100% with GME or LAZR or some shit?

The call premiums are incredibly cheap on utilities, but the deltas and gammas are massive relative to the underlying premiums. That means that if the utilities rise even 5-10%, the underlying calls go up like 100% or more! 

I think utilities are primed especially now since portfolios are being reallocated right now and into the beginning of the year. People use utilities as a safe investment since bonds suck and they can at least get some dividends from these companies. So there may be some asset reallocation into utilities in the coming days. Utilities also tend to go up like 5-10% within a short time and then consolidate for a long time and then gap up again (usually gaining like 10-15% a year). Technical voodoo shows that RSI is oversold for most utilities and MACD is alsoshowing a reversal in the trend. Short term, calls out a couple months is where I'm at (Feb/March calls). 

Longer term, utilities are an interesting play with people buying more EVs, more things that need electricity, and interest rates staying low. What do interest rates have to do with anything? Well low interest rates mean utilities can borrow money cheaply for capital expenditures. And every utility company is heavily investing in solar and wind farms and other clean energy. Plus, the recent ITC extension by Congress in the stimulus means these utilities are going to ramp up their investments in clean energy even more. These investments mean cheaper energy generation and so less overhead costs etc and potentially more profit in the long run. For these reasons, I'm in NEE, AEP, AES, XEL, and SRE periodically for the long term (that is buy on big dips and buy during consolidation a couple months out for the GAINS!).

TL;DR - Utilities bitch!

Title: BBBY Short Squeeze Thesis
Outstanding shares of BBBY are about 125 million. Of this about 18 million shares they are buying back under accelerated share repurchase program.
From the remaining 105 million shares about 72 million shares are sold short, that's almost 70% of the total float. It will take 10 full trading days to cover it. It is the 4th highest among all shorted companies.
And the final nail on the head, company is reporting earnings on 7th Jan.
My retard brain decided to buy boat load of Jan 15 calls. They are cheap and highly liquid.

Do whatever you like to do with this info.

Title: MDXG Re-listing and DD
Boys and girls, MDXG is BACK. Not only re-listed in the NASDAQ, but also the totally not gay/autistic overlords of our subreddit have unbanned my favorite biomedical stock MDXG. Some of you might be familiar with MiMedx, a company that uses patented advanced wound care technology through placental tissue allografts. A couple years back, former CEO Parker Petit (fellow autist), got a little greedy and pushed a channel stuffing scheme to pump their revenue numbers through the roof. But after kicking him to the curb and realigning their financial estimates, now is a great opportunity.

Now, what makes this company so special?

 1. Recent re-listing to the NASDAQ

 2. Recent un-banning from wallstreetbets

 3. Stock price has not had any reactionary trends to recent news (as of 12/16)

 4. New product AmnioFix is in Phase 2B and 3 of clinical trials

The current clinical trial in phase 2B for AmnioFix has been praised as the cure for cancer of the knee osteoarthritis pandemic that is sweeping our nation. This process could eliminate the need for anti-inflammatories and postpone the need for knee replacements. The same product is in phase 3 for plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendonitis. I just feel bad for the folks who enrolled in this trial and end up with placebo saline solution in their knee.

One of the biggest shareholders, Prescience Point, [has recently raised their price target to $31.](https://www.presciencepoint.com/research/research-archives/mimedx-group-inc-mdxg-update/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=a8d2fe435bb3a085e5af7129261ed4e3852c9401-1609257807-0-AQPnLjJGfDt9UvZeaSMWzMe3Od76k1l2FCzajL1UWrH75vDDAmnM3VdnWvPV4u10juKg55v-P34PvxMZvw-41U3o_CQwhnxuJQaOped1ECYDnaYPTXJLkGI45whkF1XDyCqSQvsaMcPf5UwuP0sVMCzVu-LMm0X6wI6UfL9v__cSqcmxsyhkP4g54ClD-sHfae8KRw1NZ2zxU31TvtoEaHkYM37Qid14gKe6Y1YTK1-T5NIUseWHgamFxDni2M0PzlthyPMyn7hvgTX1BcmQK_BDXpkwZ11CIX9V0Krzq2PsV0IRUdb-GncY9EyFvLmukqbDBMK0tBExJuKTiNNYNW7eXaDhQBgp3kA5h-nBh_QJW_9KBUhN9QMv_9FRSHYhcA) When the company PP gives you their DD, you know MiMedx will have you going from 0 to midnight. MDXG is a great stock and a great company with revolutionary products that has flown under the radar for too long. And if you dont buy any of this, dont come crying to me when you didnt get delicious amniotic MDXG tendies.

Title: I believe I found the next TSLA. AES, a battery storage utilities company. 10bln revenue, 8000 employees.
I know [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) is retard, but check this dudes post to justify my title: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/5u09c2/aes\_corp\_renewable\_energy\_storage/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/5u09c2/aes_corp_renewable_energy_storage/)

SIX (three) years ago, this guy had tsla, said it was not just a car company. But see, how he says AES does the same thing and isnt getting as much hype?

I'm not saying AES will go to $1000, but I think it deserves a $23 price target, the one morgan issued BEFORE earnings. If they issue a new, higher one, AES has a chance of moving even further.

&amp;#x200B;

[Heres a random picture for the retards who dont want to read, dont know how to read, are retarded.](https://preview.redd.it/yhg07kun35861.png?width=303&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eafed8ebdb24dc96ddf2fc454f8d29e10182ea64)

Furthermore, AES has had massive call buying, if you check CVS, FISV, they had the same and ended up breaking out to the upside. Now, I'm no technical analyst, but AES is EXACTLY at its pre-covid highs, and just check the options chain for yourself on yahoo, or barchart. The volume and open interest is OUTSTANDING.

There is a serious chance for this stock to break out, wallstreet is waiting for a break to $23 based on the options. I have $1800 on the company!!! I can post screenshots if u really want. this is not a pump and dumb, tis is LEGIT DD!

**TLDR**: **read the stocks link post i gave, do you**r own DD, check analyst price targets in thinkorswim and compare how morgan price targets have risen and actually changed and accurately predicted price.

current price target from morgan is $23, calls that are crazy is like 22k in nov 20 (WEEKLY NOW!! WOW) $22 and 22k in dec 18 $22. So this option buyer predicts $22 AT LEAST?

hmmmm?? you do the math boys. remember FISV and CVS, CVS had hard bottom support for so long between $55-60 and then came back to $70 after earnings. FISV had been in $95-$102 channel for MONTHS, easily swing trading calls at each bottom, now after its earnings, biden win and vaccine news it broke on monday out of the range super super. all of these stocks had this same options activity, massive call buying, no puts rly, juts calls crazy all rolling out every month too.

Title: $PLTR - Palantir Technologies -The Danish Police are using PLTR software
Fun facts and info;

 Palantir Technologies - 

* Started by a handful of technologists from PayPal and Stanford University in 2004. - Since then, they have raised many billions from investors in more than a dozen issues. 
* At the previous capital increase in 2015, they were valued at over $ 20 billion. - This makes them one of the world's largest privately owned IT companies. - until its IPO this year 2020.
* They specialize in big data analysis systems for use in intelligence, defense and police, as well as for the banking and finance industry. 
* The name Palantir itself comes from the world of fiction. It's the magical, unbreakable crystal ball of the wizard Saruman known from J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.  

Police Department of Denmark;

  
"Superweapons" Without comparison otherwise, the Danish police have recently purchased an analysis solution from Palantir for a three-digit million amount.  The Danes will use big data in the hunt for criminals. A police director tells the newspaper Berlingske that the tool they have acquired is a "super weapon", which in the long run will also be able to predict crime.  The CIA was an early investor in the company, whose customer base testifies to close ties to US defense and intelligence, but also to police and the financial industry.

Title: $ZUO rocket shipfueling up (29% done.. 71% to go)
Subscription commerce nerd checking in with an updated $ZUO DD, following their last earnings beat from 1 month ago.

My previous DD from Dec 4 **($ZUO up 29% since):** [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6k0gc/zuo\_to\_the\_moon\_pltr\_potential/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6k0gc/zuo_to_the_moon_pltr_potential/)

https://preview.redd.it/noa1seowu4861.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc290e5d285e23b54639b7b88c23bcc9210933a7

I'm still calling a 2x gain from Dec 4 levels by no later than the end of Q1 (we're already 25% up), here's why:

* $ZUO closed a deal with Siemens (one of the biggest manufacturers in the world with billions in annual revenue): [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201221005181/en/Zuora-Helps-Siemens-Transition-to-Subscriptions-for-Cloud-Based-Medical-Products](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201221005181/en/Zuora-Helps-Siemens-Transition-to-Subscriptions-for-Cloud-Based-Medical-Products)
* Deal size undisclosed, although CEO mentioned during the previous earnings call that ZUO are working on their "biggest manufacturing deal ever". He didn't refer to Siemens directly, but it's likely to be the one recently disclosed. If not, even better - in that case they have another undisclosed new large enterprise customer waiting to be announced.
* Why is this important: Zuora charges their customers two different fees: There's a fixed annual fee that customers pay for their platfrom. This fee is relatively low. On top of that, **and this is the most crucial part, customers pay a % transaction fee** for each service or product which they sell through the Zuora platform. Siemens has billions of dollars in revenue lining up to be transacted through Zuora, as Siemens transition their business to recurring subscriptions. 
* The vast majority of Zuora's customers are similar to Siemens: Large enterprises who are slowly (5-10 year process) transitioning from transactional sales to recurring subscriptions. During that ramp up phase, Zuora mostly just recognizes revenue from their fixed platform fees, as the customers are still not onboarding the majority of their revenues to the subscription-platform, while testing it out in "pilot mode". In the meantime there's a huge rocket ship being fueled up in the dark and waiting to be catapulted to Mars, once Zuora's customer go all-in and move over billions of dollars to subscription based business models.
* I think 2021 is going to be the year where we start seeing a hockey stick in revenue growth, as the global digital transformation of large enterprises is being further propelled by the pandemic. At the same time these same large enterprises (ZUO customers) who were reluctant to invest in digital transformation in 2020 are now becoming more comfortable with the global situation and are unfreezing budgets for digital / future-proof business models.
* $ZUO is very cheap compared to the rest of the NASDAQ and none of my research and upside is priced into the stock currently. This is a millionaire maker in the making.
* Next earnings Call (late Feb / early March 2021 time frame) is going to be a huge catalyst and I expect them to crush expectations again, based on the momentum build up towards the end of 2020 and expectations being fairly modest. 

**TLDR;**

* ZUO to retest previous post-IPO highs from 2018 by the end of Q1 2021 (2x potential).
* ZUO TO THE MOON 
* Some more rockets: 

**WHAT TO BUY:**

*  and boomers: 2022 LEAPS / Shares (That's my strategy, holding a few hundred shares @ 10$ average) 
* autists: 3/31/2021 20C

Title: Blue Prism DD. 100%+ upside potential in the near term based on the upcoming UI Path IPO
Blue Prism is a RPA (robotic process automation) company based in the UK. If that sounds cool, its because it is. Essentially its SAAS tools to automate processes for corporations, and the business model is based off of recurring revenue. The TAM for this kind of software will only increase in coming years. I expect to see this company in Cathie's ARKQ portfolio someday. Blue Prism is a 2B company, founded in 2001, trading on the London Stock Exchange. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why the play?**

Blue Prism's main competitor UI Path is on track to have a 1H 2020 IPO, with an expected valuation of more than 20B. UI path has around 500M in recurring revenue, putting the company's valuation at least at 40x sales. Blue Prism on the other hand is only trading at 10x sales. I expect that as the IPO nears, Blue Prism's valuation will start to converge with UI Path as the businesses are very similar. 

Source: [UI Path going to IPO 1H 2020 with valuation of more than 20B with recurring revenues of 500M](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-17/uipath-is-said-to-be-close-to-filing-confidentially-for-ipo?fbclid=IwAR0hvpY5YsW0q2z7Ucz0QgeZ8HMWoFKRo2BPVK5VBC5irP5LpsU1bQCtQtM)

&amp;#x200B;

While Blue Prism is not inherently cheap trading at 10x sales, the company has been growing at a blistering pace, with the most recent 1H financials showing revenues growing by an astounding 70% despite some customer losses due to COVID. Blue Prism is likely undervalued at the moment simply because it only trades on the London Stock Exchange. Another potential upside is that the company will likely be uplisted to the Nasdaq sometime in the near future. 

Source: [Blue Prism latest financial report showing 70% revenue growth despite COVID disruptions](https://investors.blueprism.com/sites/blueprism-ir/files/blue-prism-group-plc-30042020-rns-final.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1S61l8GNr7oJLGsjgKC4nrDZSHluGh1s65kjDm3kzoF1zPQefL49b8pqM)

&amp;#x200B;

UI Path likely has similar growth rates, though is a bit larger player than Blue Prism. Saying that, the customer reviews and offerings for the two products are very similar.

&amp;#x200B;

**Risks**

The main risk is that the IPO market is not as strong in the 1H and UI path does not command a high valuation as expected. This is also a small cap company so the share price can be volatile. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL/DR:** Blue Prism is trading at 10x sales while its main competitor UI Path is expected to IPO within the next 6 months at 40x sales at least. The services offered by both are similar, as are the growth rates and customer reviews.  I expect that Blue Prism could double, and perhaps triple as it converges to command a similar valuation to UI path.

Title: YUM DD: KFC launches game console with built-in chicken warmer
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2xa7vabDkE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2xa7vabDkE)

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Fast food chain KFC is launching a gaming console that warms up chicken.**

"The chicken chamber will keep its contents hot, ready for consumption during intense gaming sessions," KFC said.

The company said the console was designed by a global hardware maker and could play top-level games like other gaming machines.

Many people thought the gaming console was a spoof marketing campaign when it was revealed in June.

  

KFC said its new console had a custom-built cooling system that uses heat produced by its components to warm the chicken chamber.

"This machine is capable of running games at top-level specs, all on top of keeping your meal warm for you to enjoy during your gaming experience... what's not to like?" KFC spokesman Mark Cheevers told the BBC.

"If Sony or Microsoft want any tips on how to engineer a chicken chamber for their efforts next time, they'd be welcome to get in touch."

Title: Are There any $DM Competitors? ..... (I Promise, I am not a )
Before you just dismiss me as a ****, please listen to what I have to say. If you disagree, please engage in the comments with facts to back up your claims.

**1 Part Economy**

The cost to produce a 3d printed metal part is its printer cost spread over the parts produced by a single machine, material cost, and labor cost. 3D printing is largely automated, so labor is minimal. Material cost will not change between 3D printing and metal injection molding because they are made from similar metals. So, the one cost that ends up ruining the part economy for many printers is the printer cost itself. So, the faster a printer goes, the cheaper the parts are.

**2 Speed**

So, since fast printers make cheap parts, this is how profitable part economies are achieved, and this is the number 1 metric when comparing printers.

$DM's Shop system prints at 800 cc / hr along with their P-1. This seems very fast when you compare to laser systems printing at about 150 cc / hr., this is nothing compared to the low end X1 25Pro printing at 3,600 cc / hr., and especially the high end X1 160Pro at 10,000 cc / hr.

Now, those of you who have done your research will say: "Hey, the Production system prints at 12,000 cc / hr." And, you are right, this is what $DM claims. But, they haven't brought it to market yet. They have been promising this printer since 2017, but continue to push the project out. Currently, it is slated to begin shipping 2nd half of 2021. At the best case, $DM's Production system will be on par compared to the 160Pro. However, in the worst case scenarios, the Production system is pushed out another year... or it does not actually print as fast as it claims.

**3 Market Cap**

Okay, this one is easy. We just compared the printers. Now, let's look at the market caps... $DM is at $4B+ while its competitor is at $200M. We stated that at the best case scenario for $DM, it's printers will be on par with its competitor once production begins. If this were the case, their competitor is an easy buy because they are undervalued by 20 x.

**4 Experience**

$DM began when Ric Fulop left as a board member at Markforged and decided to start his own metal 3D printing company instead in 2015. However, their competitor has been making metal 3D printers since 1998 and the 160Pro is their 10th generation. The built up IP and experience cannot easily be overcome.

**5 Conclusion**

If you haven't guessed it yet, yes, $DM's competitor is ExOne. It is priced competitively and offers potential for 20 x gains. This will skip da  and  straight to Mars!

Title: PLTR is a steal right now (DD)
Hey guys, just thought I'd throw this out into the universe for autists to grab. 

PLTR is going to spike tomorrow. (98.5% chance of it finishing green tomorrow)

Based on standard deviation and probability. It's currently sitting on the 2nd standard deviation line I have placed. You can see its just about on the very bottom of it. This to me shows a spike is happening tomorrow back to the median price of 28$. (or close to it) 

[https://i.imgur.com/MPDFCsc.png](https://i.imgur.com/MPDFCsc.png)

So If you want some free tendies tomorrow (plus this stocks a great hold you retard), now is a great time to buy. Hell, unless its up a BUNCH in premarkets, you should look at setting a market buy at the current price of 25.63 for tomorrow and hopefully you get in before the spike back to median line.

It's an easy day trade to make. Quick 4-9% gains. Free tendie-monies. 

&amp;#x200B;

***Think im wrong? Ill bet a redditor 25$ on this call tomorrow. If somebody wants to bet "it closes at a loss again." (Must be a legit account, only making this bet with 1 person.)***

Title: Explaining the Palantir Mithril LP Merger
There is a link circulating which folks are taking to mean that Palantir has been acquired by Thiel's venture capital firm, Mithril LP.

Link here: [https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/premerger-notification-program/early-termination-notices/20210675](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/premerger-notification-program/early-termination-notices/20210675)

This is a bit misleading. What this SEC notice is not showing the completion of a merger, but actually is showing approval for an early termination of the Harte-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Waiting Period of the pre-merger process.

The HSR period is a 30 day period prior to a merger where parties to a merger make submissions to the FTC and DoJ. This is a component of several standard procedures required by the HSR act, which is basically just a series of antitrust regulations that I'm too retarded to understand.

Link:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart%E2%80%93Scott%E2%80%93Rodino\_Antitrust\_Improvements\_Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart%E2%80%93Scott%E2%80%93Rodino_Antitrust_Improvements_Act)

So, PLTR has not been acquired by Mithril YET, but we do know that it will be, and the SEC has basically said that in this case the 30 day waiting period isn't necessary. Perhaps Thiel and PLTR did all of the document filing really fast or some shit I don't know.

What does this mean for shareholders? Not sure. . If it's the case that Mithril buys up a large tranche of the float that would certainly be bullish and would definitely squeeze the shorts, but Mithril has only maybe 1B USD AUM ([https://aum13f.com/fund/mithril-lp](https://aum13f.com/fund/mithril-lp)). Is this enough to buy a controlling stake? Somebody who is less retarded than me can do the math.

This is what i got for ya, take it or leave it.

Title: XPEV DD 
Ting will bounce

I notice people perfer this sort of dd so basically this looks like a good dip buy, with some support in it. Stop loss at like 33.5 dollars. Will go up but not to the moon, but you can still make money off it, don't have a position on it currently but looks like a good one for market open tmmrw along with like OSTK. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR buy dip, ling make stock go back up.

Title: New info, NVAX preliminary results soon - 1/15c, 1/22c
\#NVAX Vaccine Background

I think everyone here has read the mad scientist's DD on NVAX and how it's the superior covid-19 vaccine. His DD is the closest thing to  insider trading.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k08ya1/dd\_from\_an\_actual\_scientist\_nvax\_might\_not\_be/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k08ya1/dd_from_an_actual_scientist_nvax_might_not_be/)

However, his calculations as to when Novavax would hit 50/66 cases in their UK phase 3 trial and release their preliminary results was a bit off. He predicted that the trial would hit 50 cases sometime in December 12th and December 20th. To his credit he said he isn't a statistician and his area of expertise is more on the actual substance of the vaccine. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaulkc/final\_update\_and\_predictions\_for\_nvax\_time\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaulkc/final_update_and_predictions_for_nvax_time_is/)

&amp;#x200B;

\#New info

So when will Novavax hit 66 cases in the UK Phase 3 Trial and release preliminary results which will send this stock to the moon? Recently, the Novavax trial hit the threshold to unblind their participants. Unblinding means that they tell participants whether they had the real vaccine or the placebo. Basically, they hit enough cases which means they are either nearing or have completed collecting all their data and are currently processing it (you don't unblind before most/all your data is collected as telling participants whether they have placebo or real vaccine may affect results).

[https://twitter.com/jack\_haywood92/status/1342126131777064961?s=20](https://twitter.com/jack_haywood92/status/1342126131777064961?s=20)

**( IF YOU HAVE A HARD TIME READING, LITERALLY JUST READ THIS PART. IMPORTANT PART BELOW: )**

Not to mention this guy and a lot of other people on Twitter who were unblinded by Novavax were literally told that they should expect preliminary data in 2-3 weeks. Given that most of these posts were made around December 23-24th right before Christmas, 2-3 weeks from then is either the week of Jan 3-9 or Jan 10-16. You have literally been told when to drop your life savings on FDs and when you should expect this stock to moon down to  a 2-week window.

&amp;#x200B;

\#What to do

So if you've been discouraged and been holding NVAX calls that have been getting raped by theta decay, keep bag holding or at least sell synthetic covered calls 1 week out to offset some of that theta decay. If you're holding calls that expire before 1/15, you might want to close your position and roll back your calls to either 1/15 or 1/22.

This stock is going to the moon as soon as the UK Phase 3 Data releases. We saw this stock jump 20% in a day on indirect positive news of competitors such as SinoVac having a failed vaccine. With positive preliminary data, NVAX will jump even more and I can see this having 40%+ upside off of just the preliminary data.

positions: half 1/15c $130 strike and half shares

Title: $GTBIF, the marijuana stock your wifes boyfriend owns
Now, before we begin, it is worth mentioning that your wifes boyfriends dad aka Darth Sidious, aka Mitch Mcconnell will block marijuana from being legalized for as long as he is alive. Not to worry, with an incoming democratic president, the executive branch will let marijuana legalization slowly flourish, even without full federal legalization. Also, this is my first DD so feel free to call me a retard, autist, or whatever other word you want.




**Introduction:**
$GTBIF, Green Thumb Industries, is a US-based marijuana company founded in 2014 and currently operates in 11 states. [Many of its sales](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-cannabis-stocks-that-should-be-profitable-in-2021-2020-12-12) come from high-margin derivatives such as edibles, vapes, etc. that cant be made at home. As part of its profile, it owns the luxury cannabis brand Beboe, which has been called the [Hermes of Cannabis](https://www.entrepreneur.com/company/green-thumb-industries). Remember: If you cant afford a Berken for your wife, maybe you can afford this.




**Why GTBIF:**
What do we love here at WSB: Growth and Cash Flow
GTBIF has had 31.1% year over year [revenue growth](https://investors.gtigrows.com/investors/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Green-Thumb-Industries-Reports-Revenue-of-157.1-Million-and-Positive-Net-Income-of-9.6-Million-or-0.04-Per-Share-for-Third-Quarter-2020/default.aspx) and generated 157$ million in revenue this year. With New Jersey, [a 1bn+ market](a 1bn+ market), set to become a full recreational state in 2021 (where GTBIF already has existing medical dispensaries), and NY to follow soon after, this growth should continue and potentially even expand.
 

Now for cash flow, GTBIF recently reached positive earnings per share (0.04$), which is great to have for such a fast growing company in a flourishing market. It has succeeded where many other marijuana companies have failed: creating money and managing debt to bring value to shareholders. Their cash flow should only continue to grow in the near future.




**Dangers:**
The biggest danger that I foresee is possible competition from companies such as Curaleaf, Cresco labs, TerrAscend, Accreage Holdings, Canopy Growth, etc. 
In regards to its primary competitor Curaleaf, Green thumb has a stronger balance sheet. They both have similar cash on hand, but curaleaf has 580$ million in debt compared to green thumbs 204$ million. Moreover, curaleaf has a higher market cap at 8.27 billion vs. green thumbs 5.378 billion. I believe GTBIF is a better option. 
Most of those other companies are unprofitable and do not have a clear path to profitability. Over the long term, many can and probably will succeed, but I believe GTBIF has a head start and is in the best position.





**The play:**
Since this is an OTC stock with lower volume, shares should be the only play. Also, most of you retards only have Robinhood so if you want to participate in the tendies get Etrade, Fidelity, or Vanguard in order to trade this stock.


Positions: 35 shares and looking to increase

Title: Theres a Sale on BJs!
BJs Wholesale has been trending lower ever since JPM downgraded its PT from $54 to $41 a couple weeks ago. Most analysts are expecting membership fee income and EBITDA to decline this quarter which is ridiculous. Quick side note yes I know Costco is better and thats why it trades at multiple more than 2x BJs. 

Okay moving on. 

For starters here are the latest estimates + previous quarters &amp; comps to give you an idea what kind of size and growth you are getting with BJs:

Revenue:
Q4 20 Estimate: $3.9bn
Q3 20: $3.7bn
Q4 19: $3.5bn

Gross Profit:
Q4 20 Estimate: $674mm
Q3 20: $743mm
Q4 19: $622mm

EBITDA:
Q4 20 Estimate: $189-206mm
Q3 20: $233mm
Q4 19: $221mm

EV/EBITDA:
Q4 20 Estimate: 7.8-8.2x
Q3 20: 9.6x
Q4 19: 12.8x


Now onto where I think analysts are completely off - Membership fees &amp; retention aka recurring revenue, something that gets Wall Street hard as a rock. 

Most are expecting membership growth to decline quite a bit in 2021. For context, BJs has added 700k members this year to 6.2mm, one of their largest increases in recent memory due to Covid &amp; people staying home. 

These Analysts are expecting 50% renewals for first year members vs. historically being in the 58-60% range. This is factored in with the typical 87% overall renewal rate which comes out to ~5.8mm members to end FY2021. This is where the f*** up is. 

Memberships are not going to decline 400k next year. Its just not happening, I can almost guarantee it. There are many tailwinds in 2021 that indicate continued membership growth:

1. BJs is planning to open 6 new clubs over the next 12 months which translates to roughly 150k new members at a conservative rate of 25k per store.
2. Covid. At this rate we are looking at June/July here in the northeast for a complete re-opening. Means more eating at home and more BJs.
3. We are creatures of habit. The 700k new members who are doing their grocery shopping and cooking at home arent going to just stop suddenly. If BJs can execute with good customer service people will continue coming back. This one may be a bit out there but bare with me.

TLDR: Analysts estimating $740mm EBITDA in 2021 is complete joke - buy BJs.

Title: Alibaba, Dengism, and the Chinese push for foreign investment
Strap in for a wall of text boys, it's worth it I promise. 

China's Crown Jewel, Alibaba, is trading lower in US markets on uncertainty surrounding a series of problems the company has been facing in the US media and public eye. The following are the 'catalysts' to this price action, by order of popularity in the US News media:

1. The delay of Ant Group's IPO , owner of Alipay and affiliate company of Alibaba, headed by Jack Ma
2. Antitrust investigation into Alibaba for antitrust practices, namely 'forced exclusivity' agreements with vendors
3. Rumors of bad blood betweeen Xi Jinping and Jack Ma
4. Fears of heightening hostility between US and China through trade and posturing, risk of a 'Cold War II'

All of these are immaterial, however, in the face of a much larger 'catalyst' that has been historically holding down prices for Chinese firms: red-scare propagandizing of planned economies within the US public, lack of information available to foreign investors, and a fundamental misunderstanding of the political environment and philosophies of Chinese government.

The fundamental reason for my thesis is my belief that these secondary catalysts will be removed as China opens further to foreign investment, in line with the philosophical framework that underlies their society, namely Socialism with Chinese characterstics and Deng Xiaoping Theory. Under these philosophies, China, a socialist state whose stated goal is the development of communism--a form of stateless, classless society--must harness markets where necessary within society's productive forces to maintain their position as a global power while the state apparatus continues the 'transitional phase' between socialism and communism, which is basically a very slow retraction or 'phasing-out' of the state once stability has been attained under public ownership. The people must resist capitalist aggression against China in order to be successful, since in their view China has a target on its back in the capitalist world community, and must be destroyed to maintain the validity of existing contradictory power structures within capitalist nations. In order to accomplish this, China has opened itself to foreign investment from capitalist nations, and seems eager to stabilize their role in the international community and 'spread the good word'. Whether you agree with the dominant political ideology in China, it's highly likely that it will be a key predictor of their actions in the coming months, and it is the misunderstanding oft his ideology by foreign investors that is driving their overreaction to recent news about Alibaba, and a much larger problem of high volatility and negative sentiment surrounding Chinese firms.

Under the philosophy of Dengism, if we re-examine the four catalysts driving down prices in international markets, they prove to be immaterial. Ant Group's IPO delay after Ma's struggle against regulators is part of a larger push to attract controlled foreign investment in the Chinese finance industry. Alibaba itself is not Jack Ma's property, but now part of a larger structure that must be maintained, at the risk of the collapse of the entire socialist project. If Jack Ma displays insubordination or lack of adherence to this goal, then he must be made to understand the error in his ways, or risk condemnation by the state which he is working against. Antitrust investigations into Alibaba are a push to encourage competition in the market, again with the purpose of attracting foreign investment in the country as a whole. Alibaba and Ant Group both welcome regulation, as it is part of a larger social project towards and evolution of society, and to go against this imperative would go against the very ideology their nation was founded on. Any 'bad blood' between Jack Ma and Xi Jinping is no greater than between Xi and any other chinese billionaire, and entirely depends of Ma's willingness to rejoin the path of Dengist thought, which he eventually will under penalty of death. Nonetheless, Alibaba will press on without him.

In the long run, a rising tide will lift all boats. Both Alibaba and its domestic competitors $PDD, $JD, and others will continue to grow as the sector expands, and as foreign investors gain a better understanding of China. $BABA is uniquely positioned to these other firms, as it has the strongest fundamentals and largest marketshare, with its fingers in about as many pies as a company can. Anti-trust and anti-big business are not synonymous, and Alibaba has done its part to prepare itself for the day when it would inevitably be brought into the fold by diversifying its revenue sources, and cementing itself as THE most important player in China's ascension to world superpower without falling out of favor with China's dominant political denomination.


BABA is literally too big to fail, **if you think it will respect the price floor at $200 and won't be wiped off the face of the earth (which it wont), then most LEAPs are almost all upside** [my position](https://ibb.co/zXdrBzZ)

Title: VSPR - New $BECKY SPAC
This is starting to run up on big volume, no DD or anything on WSB yet (maybe it's not big enough and my post will be removed?).

VSPR is a SPAC merging with aqua-dermabrasion company Hydrafacial.

TLDR for retards it's machine that deep cleans skin.

They sell machines and consumables to spas and clinics. Machine is like $25k and consumables aren't cheap either. Service is generally about $200 a pop and chicks generally end up with multiple / ongoing treatments. Shit is huge here in Asia.

Company generally profitable, despite lockdowns and the like still had a good 2020

CEO of Allergant/Botox - Brent Saunders, will be leading the company post-merger. He is big among the institutional investors and apparently friends with Cramer so our favourite autist will likely give this a good pump closer to merger.

I'm buying because $BECKY.

Title: Is ARK a reference to something biblical?
Aunt Cathie's website says ARK stands for "Active Research Knowledge" But I think it's a reference to Noah's Ark. As in we all better get on and ride it like it was our wifes strapon because the world is about to be flooded. Bro's this is some serious DD right here, it just literally came to me. I don't know about you guys but I'm jumping on the ARK.

Title: Why Palantir is a Solid Long (Software Engineer Perspective)
My friend is a software engineer at Google, and he believes Palantir is a solid long based off of the ability of their engineers. The hiring process at Palantir for software engineers is more competitive than Google, Facebook, etc. (or at least as competitive). He said he was rejected by Palantir but hired by Google.

I think among the tech companies, the ones with the highest engineering bar are the smaller companies (often startups), like Netflix, Facebook, Airbnb, Palantir. Google ranks somewhere in the middle difficulty. Then the "easiest" to get in are Amazon and Microsoft. Don't get me wrong though, all tech companies are hard to get in. However, I know that there are a lot of "coasters"/"slackers" in large companies who do the bare minimum etc. Large tech companies try their best to set high bar for entry, but because of the large number of engineers they need, they inevitably lower standards in the long run.

This is especially true of engineers in government... which is the ultimate "monolith" and magnet of mediocrity.

Palantir's competition is other government contractors, and the work done by other government contractors has historically been extremely mediocre. Do you remember the Obama care website that the government paid an absurd $2 billion to make? How about during covid, the state of New York couldn't manage their unemployment website (due to high traffic) by themselves. They needed help from Google to help run the unemployment website from their platform.

From my point of view, there is no way Palantir can lose if they are hiring the best engineers, and if their competition is government contractors.

Title: Market will tank...hear me out!
I know, I know. Its the exact opposite of what everyone is saying. But this beautiful savant has me convinced.

Start at 9:00: [https://youtu.be/OHv8u07nrJI](https://youtu.be/OHv8u07nrJI)

For those of you whod rather skim.

1. The Fed is purchassing assets from the banks and they are stuck with liabilities. This forces them to tighten up lending standards (like JP Morgan-Chase announced recently) resulting in less credit and spending in the economy.
2. Less spending, plus the the recession and low oil prices, causes the consumer price index (main inflation measurement) to fall. CPI also correlates with the money multiplier (the amount of times a dollar is spent before it dies by being paid against the principle of a loan.) Dollars dying means deflation.
3. Deflation makes bonds super attractive and makes stonk prices go down because of the relatively stronger dollar.

I think I summarized him right. Is there anything wrong with this logic besides printer go brrrrr?

Title: Non existent (for now) nuclear energy play
Hello fellow autists. This is the first DD I've posted here so please tell where I went full tard mode and fucked something up. If this breaks any rules I'm sorry and ill delete this post. 

NuScale Power has developed smaller, safer, cheaper, and more affordable nuclear reactors. In December of 2016 the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved NuScales design of small module reactors (SMR's). NuScale was founded with the purpose of being able to construct next generation nuclear reactors in factories. 
The major concern for nuclear power is safety. The 3 Mile Island incident, Chernobyl, and Fukushima all are severe push factors for communities to not invest billions in nuclear reactors. The last nuclear reactors was built in 2016, before that 1996. In 2019 there were 17 shutdown nuclear reactors in various stages of the expensive decommissioning process (this process can cost anywhere from 300 million to 5.6 billion). 
NuScale has come to resuscitate the need for nuclear reactors in a new fashion. Development and research of commercial reactors has largely stopped. Traditional reactors, which cost 7 to 9 billion to produce, make 1 gigawatt of energy (enough to power roughly 1 million homes). However, NuScale has taken a new approach. Their SMR's take up 1% of the space of traditional reactors but only produce 60 million megawatts. However, for 3 billion NuScale can construct 12 SMR's side by side. 
While in the commercial sector advancements for nuclear reactors has largely stopped, this is not true for the military. Since the 1960's the US Navy has sailed 1.7 million miles by nuclear powered ships without a single incident. France gets 75% of its power from nuclear reactors. NuScale represents the American response to commercial nuclear reactor advancements. 
NuScale has improved the safety of their SMR's by removing pumps, valves, and various moving parts and at the same time adding more safety mechanisms to prevent a meltdown (even if one of us retards was in control). Furthermore, they plan to construct their SMR's in factories and ship them to where they need to be reducing the cost. 
NuScale has spent 800 million, much of which comes from its main investor Fluor Corporation (FLR: NYSE). However, it also received 288 million from the Department of Energy to develop its designs. It also has its first customer in Idaho that wants NuScale to start construction on a reactor in 2023. 
There are similar companies that are doing the same thing in Russia and China. America presses on to be the world leader compared to Russia and China, so this competition could lead to more investments into NuScale, especially from a pro near energy president such as Biden. 
For no NuScale is private, but as Biden gets to set his climate change policies NuScale might look to go public to increase funding to expand. For now BHP is an investment that will flourish from not only nuclear energy expansion but also its various other mineral mining ventures. 
This is probably too early to post as there is no talk of NuScale going public, but they are a company that I would keep an eye on over the years and invest in when they go public. 

Positions: 
55 BHP shares

But for more fun: 100 PLTR shares and 30 GME shares

Title: Here's a sleeper DD for consideration. Nano One Materials (OTC)
Company: Nano One Materials (NNOMF), OTC

Location: British Columbia, Canada

What they do: Development of novel cathode procedures using a one-pot process to make coated nanocrystal for LFP, Solid State, and Li-ion cells.

What does this mean: Cost reduction in the cathode material production with better properties to withstand the formation of lithium dendrites known to degrade the performance of Li-ion cells.

Funding: Partially funded by the Canadian Government. Future revenue will come from licensing and royalties of current research. Currently losing money for R&amp;D. 

Risks: Can't gain patents because other companies challenge their research. Scalability issue for mass production., etc...

Why you should care? Batteries is the lifeblood of future EV companies who compete with Tesla to which Tesla is ahead in their R&amp;D. 

This is OTC. Can't play the options market with this one. I tossed money into this company like 3 years ago in the past because I knew battery tech is crucial to BEV in the future. I sold all my position in January 2020 because I needed to take that funding and shove it into whatever Wallstreet Bets was hawking. Currently, this company just reached its 52-week high and that always means a correction. This is a sleeper because it flies under the radar of the traditional US indices and it's OTC. 

Link to all their filings.  [https://www.sedar.com/DisplayCompanyDocuments.do?lang=EN&amp;issuerNo=00006073](https://www.sedar.com/DisplayCompanyDocuments.do?lang=EN&amp;issuerNo=00006073)

Title: GME, hypnotism, and general ideals of manifestation. The squeeze HAS to happen, and here is why...
Here is the thing. Stonks don't just "go up". They do technically go up, but this is not because of any qualities inherent to stock or shares. It is because of the collective psychological rally surrounding the stock market, the collective consciousness making a decision and people deciding that they are going to ride with it. It is no secret that emotions control the battlefield when everyone starts trading in those early hours of the morning. But what you may not be entirely aware of is that the stocks that succeed for you are succeeding because they HAVE to succeed. It is all just manifestation, and when a large enough proportion of the collective consciousness decides something is going to be a certain way, it's just going to be that way and you cannot fight it.

You can see this general principle of manifestation in action (and used for bad) when someone tries to pump and dump a stock. They get everyone to believe, and thus it becomes real. You also see it used for good when someone YOLOs their entire portfolio here. What they are doing is not actually risky. What they are doing is making a positive outcome necessary. Think of it as cornering your fate. When your fate has no other option, you are now in control of the path, no matter the odds.

I liken manifestation and magick thinking to something like hypnosis. Hypnosis works for people, but it doesn't work for everyone. The people hypnosis does NOT work for are the people who don't believe in it. The ironic side of manifestation is that everyone who thinks it's bullshit never reaps the benefits and gets themselves stuck in a negative feedback loop where nothing works out because they never think it will and so they never decide within themselves that things ARE going to work out simply because they ARE. If you decide that something is going to work, then it WILL. I can hear you know. You're saying "Well I wanted the stock to go up but it didn't and I lost money blah blah blah" and to that I would reply, if that stock HAD to go up for you, then you would have MADE it go up, so it didn't. When something HAS to happen, it's made to happen. When that stock failed for you, were you posting about it to build sentiment, were you creating a risk for yourself that made it a necessity for you, were you doing EVERYTHING you could to make it happen? Fortune favours the bold.

Lets bring this back around to GME. It is no secret that financial institutions have put themselves in a less-than-ideal situation with GameStop. Now I am going to admit, I don't totally understand how any of this works, but I do know one thing. It is only going to work if we, as a whole, will it into existence. Every DD posted, every piece of positive sentiment regarding the squeeze that is posted, all of this contributes to people buying more shares, increasing the personal stake of everyone involved. By sheer will of force GME IS going to squeeze, but the squeeze only exists if you believe in it and do what someone who believes in it would do (buy shares).

So here is my suggestion...

Understand that this squeeze IS happening, and that you are part of what is going to make it happen. Create a universe where it HAS to squeeze. Give yourself no other option. Hype people up to buy shares, do your own DD, press the limits of the risk-thresholds you've established psychologically. Put yourself in a position where the squeeze HAS to happen, and it will lead others to do the same. There will simply be too much universal energy commanding the squeeze for it NOT to happen.

See you on the battlefield.

Title: Basic DD on $SNAP based on stories and individual snaps over the past year
Im posting this as DD because it isnt complete conjecture. 

Ive noticed that over the past six months, my friends and I have posted and/or have received significantly less stories and snaps compared to the last year. 

I realize that ad sales are up as of last earnings, but what I would like to know is if you guys are experiencing the same thing? It doesnt appear to be isolated to me. 

If this is indeed true then Id imagine ads would dwindle eventually, bringing about a good opportunity for a short position (or medium/long term puts if you have the balls).

Title: 2021 will be a great year for Ford
New CEO is the best CEO they have had in a long time.  He is the first in a while that has spent his entire life in the car industry and not just some rando.  The last guy made like furniture or something.

Mach E will be coming in 2021.  More details about all electric F150.  They're coming out with their electric fleet Vans, and due to their massive sales volume, once they start to roll out subscription based self driving software, they already have the consumer base, and it will be an absolute massive additional revenue stream. They already have the connections and so forth to make the sales.  

They have massive sales increases in China and growing profits.  Sitting on a  here.  Small enough market cap to pump this ez.

Title: Help me turn 20k into 400k
So I stared 2020 about 180k in the hole and managed to lose another 127k this year to put myself 307k in the hole. I've got about 20k left... figure I should give it one more shot. What's the worst that could happen, I lose another 20k? Yeah who cares.

Since I'm really bad at trading, I need your help to 20x this 20k and if that happens I promise I'll just throw it all away on another year of autistic behavior.

Since I'm a homosexual the best idea I have is to put all 20k on JUN 2020 SDS calls and just set a sell order for 20x what I pay for them. I might leave a few hundred in reserve to average down at some point.

Unless there's a better idea I think this is a good week to enter the SDS long, right? Can this go mammary glands up? It can't, right?

Title: B*tcoin Mining and $NVDA/$AMD DD 
Hello all,

I do not know if you guys have been noticing that a lot of graphics cards for sale are sold out. This is due to the recent pump of B*tcoin, soaring past the $20k USD ATH price point. As b*tcoin pumps, there is a greater demand for graphics cards thus causing a shortage of graphics cards. As demand for graphics cards rise and supply of graphics cards plummets, prices rise (thus causing share price to rise as well). 

Now, if we look at historical data of NVDA, AMD, and B*tcoin--we can see this exact situation occur back in 2018 when b*tcoin reached an ATH of 19k USD--NVDA and AMD followed suit and continued to pump. However, shortly after B*tcoin tanked--NVDA and AMD also followed and proceeded to tank.

This is why to , buy puts on AMD and NVDA dated for Q4 2021.

Thank me later :)

Title: Steel Update #4 - consolidation = consolidation $ 4 stocks that will benefit
Lots of nervous people out there today with shares/options of $VALE, $CLF, $X, $NUE, $STLD and $MT.

Today was a down day for many steel stocks, while the greater market was up.

Many of these stocks have been parabolic and were due for a "cooling of period" and some consolidation.

Also, if you look, many of the stocks I mentioned were trading at well below the 10-day Average Volume.

**Low volume** pullbacks occur when the price **moves** towards support levels on **lower** than average **volume**. **Low volume** pullbacks are often a sign of weak longs taking profit, but suggest that the long-term uptrend remains intact. High **volume** pullbacks suggest that there **could** be a near-term reversal.

This is the true definition of "paper hands".

Weak longs, taking profit.

I was very confident when I first posted and still am on many steel stocks.

Supply remains an issue.

Demand out paces supply and in many cases - order books are pushing 4-5 months out, without prices having been established.

Raw material costs have surged over the past 6 weeks, but iron ore has retreated a little due to China now moving from iron ore to shredded scrap for the main ingredient in their steel making.

[https://agmetalminer.com/2020/12/23/chinese-steel-scrap-imports-could-be-market-mover-in-2021/](https://agmetalminer.com/2020/12/23/chinese-steel-scrap-imports-could-be-market-mover-in-2021/)

[https://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3968389/Search-results/SOUTH-ASIA-STEEL-SCRAP-Import-prices-jump-following-international-price-trend.html](https://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3968389/Search-results/SOUTH-ASIA-STEEL-SCRAP-Import-prices-jump-following-international-price-trend.html)

The other two large scrap users are the United States and Turkey.

In the US, scrap has increased by $135/ton over the past month - the largest one month increase **IN HISTORY.**

"China essentially sets the global prices for seaborne iron ore. The country could potentially have a similar impact on the Asian steel scrap market.

By comparison, the U.S., the worlds largest single exporter of steel scrap, exported only 18 million tons in 2019 after four years of gradually rising volumes, much of which went to Turkey. Coincidentally, Turkey imported a similar 18.857 million tons in 2019, to the likely upper limit of potential Chinese imports next year.

Would that be enough to move the market and raise global steel scrap prices?

**Yes, almost certainly.**

With China now entering the market for shredded scrap - it is forecasted that prices could jump anywhere from $50-$100/ton in early January.

**OK, so what does this mean for steel stocks and when are they going to reflect what's going on in the market?**

I believe this will begin happening in early January when US manufacturers start reporting earnings and **GIVE STRONG GUIDANCE for 2021.**

$CMC - reports 1/11

$STLD - reports 1/20

$NUE - reports 1/26

$X - reports 1/28

$CLF - reports 2/18

Then we have:

$MT - reports 2/11

$VALE - reports 2/18

Why do I believe there will be surprise revenues, EPS and strong guidance?

Because of a few different factors:

1. The previous quarters reported were some of the worst, with many of these steel companies being impacted by COVID - just like we have seen in this past earnings season for many non-steel companies - the bar was set very low - with the exception of $NUE and $CMC - their EPS came in above expectations - a sign of good things to come.
2. Many mills were shut down or capacity was cut back - it takes time for all of this to come back on-line, this is one of the many reasons that demand is outpacing supply, utilization rates are growing daily.
3. However, once mills get caught back up, which I believe based on today's order books, won't be until late summer, early fall - **the demand will remain HIGH due to low borrowing rates, infrastructure packages for countries around the world, the US housing market continuing to change and the renaissance of suburban/rural America - which will need commercial infrastructure to support the growing populations, re: schools, hospitals, roads, bridges, government buildings - police, fire, courts, etc.**
4. Other countries are staring to become isolationist in their own domestic steel supply and due to skyrocketing costs, India and now Russia are both looking to ban the export of many products made in their own countries.

**Which brings me to this:**

According to Trading Economics website, **global steel prices have increased 15.39 per cent year-on-year, while iron ore prices are up 76 percent during the same period**.

**In Chinas Dalian Exchange, iron ore prices have gained 50 percent this year compared to hot-rolled steels 20 percent rise**.

The recent increase in steel prices is finally now starting to catch up with the increases in iron ore.

**They are now being passed on pretty much dollar for dollar AND THEN SOME.**

Manufacturers that are vertically integrated like $VALE, $CLF, $CMC and $MT - **will most definitely benefit the most.**

I am now adding **$CMC as an undervalued play on the back of rising steel prices.**

Many don't know $CMC bought all of Gerdau's rebar mills in the United States in 2018.

"Vertically Integrated Business Model: CMC's vertically integrated business model and focus on pull-through volumes **benefits consistent capacity utilization and positions the company as a low cost producer. Approximately 50%-60% of scrap from CMC's recycling operations gets sold to CMC's mill operations**.

**Additionally, nearly 100% of steel supply for its fabrication operations was sourced internally in fiscal 2020**. CMC's recycling facilities are often located in close proximity to mills, resulting in reduced transportation costs. Mills also have a steady and captive source of demand through internal shipments to fabrication facilities leading to consistent utilization rates across these segments.

Fitch believes the company's vertically integrated model also provides some margin resiliency through the cycle. Mills and fabrication operations tend to have lower margins in periods of rapidly increasing scrap prices, whereas recycling operations tend to perform well under the same conditions. The inverse correlation and timing difference of peak profitability during volatile scrap and rebar price environments across different segments helps provide some insulation against price volatility"

**Remember -** $CMC will be the first to report on 1/11.

Their last quarter was a surprise on earnings, with revenues being down due to COVID.

I believe this next one will be a grand slam on revenue (due to higher steel prices and increased volumes) and EPS will be another surprise on the back of being able to benefit on the vertical integration of scrap and taking advantage of a rising market.

Their guidance will most likely be very solid, citing strong order books and demand.

This is also why I like $MT, $VALE and $CLF - vertically integrated suppliers will benefit the most in rising markets - top line and bottom line.

I believe steel stocks will trade in sympathy with what happens on the 11th with CMC and then we have a rising tide reporting for the entire next month until $VALE reports on 2/18.

Again, I like $MT the best due to them being the largest manufacturer in the world, but the vertical integration of $CLF (who $MT has common stock in) $VALE and $CMC are all poised to take a ride on the material rocket that will be 2021.

Lastly, Schnitzer Steel will benefit from the skyrocketing scrap market. Low volume stock, but has the potential to double in short order.

Sorry for the delay in getting this out today - I actually have many jobs/hats I wear and this had to wait.

We are in a consolidation period - have some patience.

If you feel that you want to take profit and put it into something else that is more volatile with larger swings - do it.

I'm confident we see breakouts to 2018 levels on steel stock prices, with potential for a 2008 like spike.

Good Luck!

Title: GameStop DD and potential profits.
So I know some of you are feeling cucked and have been expecting a short squeeze every single day for the last X amount of days...

But here is my DD, and how you can play in a role and profit with or without touching the stock. 

Youre confused so let me speak your language



GameStop offers PowerUp rewards membership.

There is a free tier, and $15 yearly membership tier. 
Buy the $15 membership right now...youve lost more money than that in less than 15 seconds today...youve spent more money on that for lube and protection around your nearest Wendys. 


#If every one of you with positions in GME actually did this, their profit numbers would look ridiculous at the next ER. If you spread this info to other people, many of whom are not aware, they may utilize it and ER would look even better. 

So what does this $15 get you?

A $5 coupon every month that you can use on any item, including gift cards, and online gamin stores. Any of them...all of them

After 3 months you break even, after the 4th month you have a higher percentage gain than your RH account. 

So you spend $15 for membership, and get $60 in the course of 12 months. 

Your net profit is $45. If every month you pick up a $10 gaming card (PSN/XLive/ N eShop), you only end up paying $5 each month. 

At the end of 12 months, you spent an actual $75, but ended up getting $120 worth of stuff. 

Use it for yourself, or if youre not a gamer, save them up and gift it to someone. Or give it to your wifes boyfriend so he can use it while his dick is during the refractory period.

TL;DR:

Buy the $15 membership, it can and will help your GME positions...

Title: Missed the DKNG rocketship? Here's your second chance 
DKNG and SKLZ are two recent IPOs that happened through SPACs, both in the online gaming/betting/gambling industry. this industry is fucking hot right now, and the growth of both stocks reflects that

there's a brand new online sports betting/gambling SPAC and its name is ACAC, pronounced ayyy CACK. its targeting the online gaming/betting/gambling industry, and its board is stacked with the right people to do so:

- [Edward King](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-king-8b660963/)(Head of Global Gaming Investment Banking at Morgan Stanley for the past 20 years)
- [Jim Murren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimmurren/)(Former CEO of MGM International for 12 years).
- [Chris Grove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/csgrove/)(expert on online betting/gambling, been in the gaming/betting/gambling industry for 20+ years). 
- [Dan Fetters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-fetters-18835b25/)(Managing Director at Morgan Stanley for the past 20 years) 

it just recently became traded, and imo at or near the 10$ NAV price point it's a solid pickup with very little risk and a lot of upside 

Title: $BABA and the political and financials uncertainties facing it.
I've not written a "DD" on Reddit as [r/wsb](https://www.reddit.com/r/wsb/) puts it, but I've done a few for myself during 2020. After seeing countless $BABA posts, I decided to do my own research on whether to buy or to ignore the current market. Fullest disclosure, I am currently long on $BABA and have my first position in at $256 totaling $10k, then at $228 totaling $7k. If the stock does continue to drop, I will be adding at intervals of 10% declines. I am fully aware of the uncertainties facing the Chinese market and Chinese stocks and think they are being more than fairly rewarded by the market given the discounts such stocks have seen in the last week or so.

\---

During the last few weeks, things have happened all across the globe which has mostly forced a beating on the markets. Things like a new strain of COVID being found in many parts of Europe, Brexit talks running into hurdles, and lack of progress on the COVID relief bill. But one news, in particular, struck one of the largest companies in the world and caused a near 15% decline in a single day. [China's anti-monopolistic probe of Ali Baba ($BABA)](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#), the largest tech company in the country, forced the company's stock to dive by a remarkable 17% at one point in the day... [only to end down 13% at the close](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#). The volume required to drop the stock of a $600+ billion company is no easy feat and yet the market achieved it, on a half-day nonetheless.

The question is, was the drop warranted, or has the market overreacted here? I'll outline this by pointing to some qualitative and quantitative facts.

**Qualitative**

1. China's lacks credibility and often isn't extended the benefit of the doubt
2. Chinese companies have a bad track record when it comes to financial audit and due diligence

**Quantitative**

1. $BABA's financial health
2. $BABA as a key holding in renowned ETFs and in institutional portfolios

**Qualitative 1: Chinese political affairs**

Ideologically, the western world abhors the communist system that is the core of the Chinese political field, in which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is the central figure. CCP Run by XI Ping, who believes the entirety of the Chinese economic system must obey the commands of the CCP is one that is often met with criticism from the West (and perhaps rightfully so). But this criticism (which is biased) makes the outsider look at CCP as a self-destructive power that knows no limitation of self. In truth, [since the '70s the Chinese economy has grown more than every other country on the planet, and the economy has the lowest "doubling time" of any other country](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#). If the central ruling party was indeed a self-destructive one, then how could such tremendous growth be maintained over five decades.

So, the CCP may be ideologically unsound, but economically, and politically the CCP cares for nothing more than China to become a supreme power. To continue achieving this vision CCP implements controls throughout the country in banks, corporations, and all key institutions. [It did this very same thing back in 2018 with Tencent, as the party feared that western and foreign games were becoming a root of violent behaviour in Chinese children](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#). The party then did its thing and eventually came to the conclusion to lift the ban and begin approving imported games once more. It didn't care about Tencent as much as it did about its own population and the potential consequences of its own assumptions and concerns.

Today, [CCP is once more amidst a similar issue facing the Chinese public but in the form of Ant Group (a third of which is owned by Alibaba Holdings) behaving like a tech firm but operating as a bank](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#). Its behaviour is considered tojeopardize the economic stability of the nation and its people and such practices could potentially endanger and expose the Chinese economic system to credit and default risk... especially if they were to continue outside the realm of financial regulations necessary for banks (and similar financial organizations) to remain liquid and appropriately capitalized.

This action by CCP however has been muddled with speculation as [Jack Ma's own comments on the country's regulatory environment were one that felt like a jab at the country's authoritarian government](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#). In return, the western public is considering CCP's actions to be disguised as investigations and probes when they are really about nothing but showing Jack Ma who's the boss in the town. The public can be right, but once again, it takes the road of assuming the CCP is an ego-driven, self-destructive entity that cares more about self than the very thing it governs. I don't think the government cares about Jack as much as the media and the public think it does. Jack didn't get where he is without being on the government's good side, and on top of that, Jack didn't get there not knowing the rules of the game. He knows damn well who is in charge, but simply failed to think before he spoke this time around and for that CCP will surely set him straight.

The point of it all is, while CCP may teach Jack a lesson, it is by no means going to come down on Alibaba as harshly as the market thinks it will... because Alibaba is a crucial part of the economy and helps hundreds of thousands of businesses sell their goods online, and a good part of it is bought by the western world. More, $BABA isn't the only target of this antitrust probe... in fact, every Chinese tech giant is a target because they are too powerful to let roam and make their own rules. They need to be reigned in, and the CCP has finally had it.  
But these political biases are distracting investors from some key points and they are;

1. Jack Ma has not been the CEO of $BABA for a while. If the CEO of $BABA had made such remarks surely that would be cause for the level of concern the market has labeled it to be.
2. Ant Group is only 1/3rd owned by $BABA, yet $BABA has lost nearly all of Ant's value in its own market cap.
3. Penalizing $BABA continues affecting China's global image negatively as such penalties come with political risk for foreign investors.
4. Severe penalties on $BABA also negatively affect the 100,000 people it employs and million more who consider the platform to be their livelihood.

Lastly, I do think this probe is very important as there were [definitive anti-competitive plays made by $BABA in order to retain its stranglehold on the market](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#). But we must also realize that while [anti-trust laws have been around for more than a century in the U.S (established in 1890)](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#), [China's are all but a decade old (put into place in August 2008).](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#)This means because these laws are relatively new, foreign investors consider their future to be much more uncertain as they can still be amended, and relatively quickly too. The outcome may make it harder for Chinese tech giants to have a gun against small businesses ' heads or even against the heads of new startups and companies... But let's be honest, politicians and businessmen are the same globally.

**Qualitative 2: Chinese companies have a bad track record**

[The Luckin Coffee accounting scandal](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#)was the drop that spilled the coffee cup over. It now stains every white and blue-collar shirt in American institutions. As a response, the American government headed by Donald Trump [felt the need to pass a law demanding Chinese companies to be financially audited by appropriate boards if they wish to remain listed on American exchanges](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#).

This has lit the already $BABA-related speculation on fire and the market thinks the risk now associated with $BABA outweighs the potential reward. While this does affect Chinese companies, $BABA is among the largest public tech companies globally but that holds no merit in the western world because it is not western, and even worse, it is Chinese.

When Europe and the world launch Anti-trust probes against American tech giants, their stocks barely move down. The point to really consider carefully is when even an outside body launches a probe against an American company, their stock sees no significant downfall. How is it that investors of American tech companies don't feel fazed by external bodies launching investigative efforts into the very things they are invested in? But when a country like China launches its own investigation into one of its own giants, the world begins fearing the absolute worst. The benefit of the doubt is not extended, and once more the assumption that CCP will take full advantage of its authoritarian and behave recklessly becomes the default.

Then there is the delisting law on the same front and by taking swift action and accelerating price drops in $BABA's stock, it seems as if the market has already decided that $BABA will fail to comply with regulations.[It must be noted that this is a company that is currently held in 166 hedge funds and is 4th among 30 stocks that typically make it to a hedgefund's portfolio.](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#)So, this assumption that $BABA will fail to comply is one that not only undermines $BABA but also every institution that holds it in their portfolios because they failed to do their due diligence. As of the time of writing, o[ne of these institutions is Ark Invests which holds nearly $50 million in $BABA, making it their 12th largest holding... and more, it is 1 of 7 Chinese ADRs in the fund's ARKF ETF.](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#)Perhaps this speaks more to the general faith that Ark has in the ADRs they hold than $BABA in general... but still, the market couldn't care less it seems.

Continuing on this issue around Chinese companies and the required auditing oversight... Perhaps it will be news to people to hear that this issue has surfaced time and time again. [Here it was brought up as a concern by Senator Marco Rubio in 2019](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#)and while the bill was being supported in house and senate, [Alibaba indicated that they would be able to comply with all financial requirements set forward by the bill](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#)as it typically deals with PwC's Hong Kong arm of financial and audit-related services. This comment by $BABA, too, has zero market value, and investors are still not convinced enough to purchase instead of sell.

In a word, the situation revolving around $BABA is nothing short of a shitstorm, and in it, regardless of what $BABA does its stock price takes a hit. [Even after announcing a near doubling of its repurchase program, the market decided to completely ignore the news and keep the stock price steady.](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#)The general sentiment around the web seems that this repurchase is not significant enough. A company buying back nearly 2% of its shares is not significant enough but $BABA insiders don't think so as they've now scooped up $10billion worth of shares at some 35% discount.

**Quantitative 1: $BABA's financial health**

When news of Ant's IPO first began coming out and thus the news of associated potential regulation, $BABA went from $319 to $285 within a week, a near 9% drop. The following week the stock went from $285 to $265, another 7% drop... and after trading sideways for two or so weeks, in the last week of December, $BABA went from $265 to $222, adding a near 15% to the mounting drop. [Overall, $BABA now sits 30% below its ATH providing a potential opportunity of 44% upside.](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#)

To fully take advantage of this, it becomes crucial to assess whether $BABA can financially bear the pain that is being caused by the political uncertainty surrounding it. While political risks are almost always temporary, companies with a hundred billion dollar caps can be severely impacted in the short term by such events (i.e. regulation, trade-war-related tensions, etc.). However, as long as the company is financially stable to weather the storm then the short-term price action becomes irrelevant to an extent... Of course, that is not to say one should get in early because waiting may very well lead to better buying opportunities. Such was the case for those who waited for the stock to drop in the last week of December. The question is, should potential investors continue waiting?

Well, let's begin with the year 2020 and the growth potential in operations and earnings.

2020 has been the year of eCommerce and online presence. Few companies outside the internet realm have benefitted from the COVID pandemic, which has essentially moved almost everything to the web. In November it was reported that [$BABA "broke records again, raking in 498.2 billion yuan (roughly $75 billion)." during the singles-day event in China](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#). This was an increase of 26% compared to the same time last year. Not only that, but analysts expect $BABA's revenues to increase more than 25% for the coming four quarters. This can be seen in the image below and [the link here on barchart](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#).

It's clear that $BABA is poised to continue growing its operations as long as it can weather the political shitstorm in China. That is to say from purely the growth perspective it is a safe bet. There are a few other points that make $BABA an even better hold over multi-year periods. For example;

1. [China is set to become the world's largest economy within the next decade.](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#)
2. [Single's day in China brings in more revenues than Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined.](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#)
3. $BABA is entering new markets, including that of cloud and EV. While these efforts may not become their bread and butter, they may have a significant impact on the bottom line. Some details include, $BABA[expecting to invest $28billion into its cloud infrastructure over the next three years](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#) and [has entered into a minority shareholder agreement with State-owned automaker SAIC Motor, a major player in the Chinese automotive market](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#).
4. $BABA is expanding its footprint globally.

* [Source 1: Expanding commercial platform to small businesses in the U.S.](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#)
* [Source 2: BABA seeking to expand cloud footprint in Saudi Arabia after establishing a partnership with a Saudi telecom.](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#)

1. $BABA has seen its revenue go from $24billion in 2016 to $73billion in 2019, a near 204% increase. Whereas $AMZN has seen its revenues go from $136billion to $280billion, a near 105% increase.
2. In 2019, $BABA had a net income of $22billion whereas $AMZN had a net income of $12 billion.

Then there is $BABA's current financial health as reported on their balance sheet.  
The following is a comparison between [$BABA's financials ](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#)and [$AMZN's financials](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#) as of 2019;

1. $BABA had $185billion in total assets while only having $61billion in total liabilities, resulting in a D/E ratio of 0.49. In comparison, $AMZN had $225billion in assets while having $163billion in total liabilities, resulting in a D/E ratio of 2.62.
2. $BABA had $65billion in current assets and $34 billion in current liabilities, resulting in a current ratio of 1.9. $AMZN on the other hand has $96billion in current assets and $88billion in current liabilities, resulting in a current ratio of 1.1.
3. $BABA had $53billion cash on hand while $AMZN had $55billion.
4. $BABA had $19billion in free cash flow while $AMZN had $22billion.

$BABA beats $AMZN on all fronts except for Cash on Hand and Free Cash Flow... Even then, $BABA is run much more efficiently than $AMZN because the difference between those two metrics is less than $2billion and 3billion respectively.

So, labeling $BABA as "financially stable" is an understatement. In reality, $BABA is more than capable of handling hurdles thrown their way given how lean their balance sheet and operations are. But all this is going to be lost on those who think that $BABA's financial reporting may not be reliable like every Chinese company.

In summary, $BABA is making each dollar go further than $AMZN despite being valued at one-third. But this is in no way a point for or against $BABA, it is simply a difference in the way investors analyze and value the two companies. The benefit of the doubt that we've been talking about in this entire article is not just withheld when it comes to political factors but also when it comes to financial matters as seen above. Truth is $BABA just doesn't enjoy the same P/E ratio as $AMZN does despite having much more room to grow as a company.

And regardless of Ant's IPO being halted these numbers are more than likely to remain on their current trajectory. It all makes me wonder if the drop in $BABA's price is based on nothing more than political speculation... because it sure as hell can't be based on their financial performance. Moreso, if Ant's IPO receives the go-ahead, [albeit with a major restructuring of their businesses](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#), $BABA has only to gain from such an event. If it doesn't go through, nothing happens... or at least, nothing should happen as [Ant is a standalone entity outside of Alibaba Holdings](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#). If it wasn't, it should've already been accounted for in their current financial reporting.

**Quantitative 2: $BABA as a keyholding by institutional investors**

As previously mentioned, [$BABA is currently held in 166 hedge funds and is 4th among 30 stocks that typically make it to a hedgefund's portfolio.](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#)Here is a breakdown of who holds how much [(source)](https://www.blogger.com/u/3/blog/post/edit/414747608216188857/2804566460768051158#);

* 43.86% of shares held by institutions
* 2,780 institutions currently holding $BABA
* Top Institutional Holders &gt; $10b  

   * Blackrock = $26b
   * Vanguard Group = $18b
   * Price Associates = $18b
   * FMR, LLC = 11b
   * State Street Corporation = $11b
* Not only this but Ark Invests, an institution that I personally keep up with, increased their ARKF ETF position by 16,654 shares on December 21. This trade cost approximately $4.5million and increased their ARKW ETF position by 50,108 shares, costing approximately $13million.
* Ark has not yet sold $BABA and has more than $50million worth $BABA in its ETF

**Summary**

Make of this what you will, but personally, Ant's IPO can only have a positive impact on $BABA's future trajectory despite the restructuring it may have to do. The truth is $BABA (along with every other Chinese company) just doesn't get the same benefit of the doubt as a European or American company, and perhaps rightfully so. A few bad apples do ruin the image of an entire field. But once the bad apples are dealt with, and they will be dealt with, the good ones have nothing but to benefit. The delisting law can be seen as a negative as it brings up a lot of political uncertainty, but another way to think of it is to imagine the credibility that comes with remaining as a listing past 2023, and fully complying with the newly passed American law.

Similarly, the political uncertainty in China establishing/amending anti-trust laws is, too, temporary and as much as we'd like to think that CCP is targeting Jack for his bad-mouthing, the truth is CCP wants full and complete control of tech giants and wants to reign in their powers. If it was just about Jack, then the rest of the tech firms wouldn't be diving, albeit less than $BABA.

Title: PROOF GME IS MOONING TOMORROW AND BEYOND
All I can fucking say is Ive been watching to volume/resistance data all fucking day for GME and there was HEAVY resistance at the $21.20+ mark all through $23....Im talking close to a million dollars in sell orders almost every cent of the way up.

Now an hour or so before close it completely dissipated to about 1/5th of that and of course now that its after hours its even lower. 

Im pretty fucking sure the  squad is behind this tomfoolery but honestly Im really fucking pumped for tomorrow and Wednesday. 

Im thinking we see steady increases and as it creeps higher and higher Melvin Crapital is gonna be forced to cover and MOON THIS SHIT 

To all you paper handed f4ggots - enjoy your Wendys jobs u fucking degenerate cucks. Me and all the other diamond handed gods will be fucking your wifes boyfriends in our lambos in no time 

Honestly all you idiots have to do is load up on shares and wait for the squeeze to happen. SHARES. Stop only buying calls u fucking retards thats how Melvin and his wifes boyfriend wins. We. Need. SHARES.

DIAMOND HAND THAT SHIT



Positions: 5000 shares
1000 calls (not tellin dates/strikes)

CURRENTLY DEEP RED but Im a diamond-handed mother fucker so I aint scared.

Title: BBBY earnings and technical play
My last technical play [FCEL](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kghrjf/fcel_bull_flag_breakout/) worked out  so well (reached my 50% gain price target within a week), so I wanted to share a new play with hopes of recreating that magic. This one's a little different in that I'm entering sooner than I normally would, so I would starting small and averaging in.

BBBY is exhibiting a wedge pattern and is on the verge of breaking out. Normally, I would wait for a confirmed  breakout with volume before getting in, but BBBY reports earnings on 1/7/21, so it might be too late to get in with a good price due to earnings IV pump. For reference, BBBY beat its last earning projection, and I would expect it to do well this quarter too. It's found good support at the low $18's, so unless it drops way below that, it's a low risk play to get in now imho. As an added bonus, like our darling GME, BBBY has a decent short interest too, so an earnings smash has the possibility for a good old squeeze.

I would look for post 1/7 calls with relatively low IV. 2/19 is probably the earliest I would go for now, with March a safer choice. Price target is difficult since it hasn't broken out yet, but I would put a conservative $26 target, and over $30 on an earnings blowout.

Title: PLTR now is the time to get in 
PLTR has been trading between 25 and 30 for some time now and probably will continue to do so for the next week or two before it breaks out in January.  


It's trading at just over $25 right now where there is massive support and it probably won't go lower than it is right now again.  


Anybody that wants to get in on the PLTR express should do it now.   


positions: 2300 shares &amp; a bunch of random options expiring jan, april, jan '22  


Just posting as an FYI for anyone that felt like they missed out on PLTR 

Title: $LULU to the moon and here is why
What's up retards, long time lurker and full time tendiemaker here. LULU is going to go full meme stock in the next 6 months and here is why. 

# Technicals

Okay let's get this out of the way for the idiots out there like me who thrive on Technical Analysis. Even the dumbest of us can see that LULU has been going straight up as far back as Robinhood allows you to go. It shows a clear reverse downtrend pattern, and is in the process of doing the double batman pattern. For you newbies out there, this means our trusty sidekick Robin(hood) is telling us to buy calls.

# Fundamentals

If you are an even bigger bullshitter, you'll know that Technical Analysis is for people that use the stairs. If you park in the blue and use the easy access ramp, then I know you are like me and check out the Fundamentals. 

1. LULU has basically always had incredible earnings reports, constantly beating analyst expectations. Furthermore, their stock price continues to increase the following quarter after a strong earnings report. Guess what? Earlier this month, they BLASTED earnings, beating expectations. You'll notice that all of 2020, their stock price has gone down immediately after posting earnings, but then will shoot back up in no time. The price has been going down because LULU has not issued guidance, siting COVID as the reason for uncertainty. But EVERY time this happens, the stock goes down and EVERY time LULU proves investors wrong by keeping a strong supply chain. 
2. Don't believe me that LULU is a good buy? Those of you who have TDAmeritrade should check out the "Fundamentals" Tab under analysis. Analyst ratings are all on ACCUMULATE and BUY. 
3. How about Price Targets? Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank, and Barclays all raised LULU's Price Targets this month, with Morgan Stanley joining them a few days later. The highest price target is by JPM at $442. LULU is trading at \~$355 as I am writing this. And if you follow price targets closely, you should know that these big banks like to have conservative price targets so that they are more likely to hit their targets and don't look stupid to investors. If JPM is saying $442, what they really mean is $500+++
4. Do you guys know the CEO, Calvin McDonald? This guy is an all star and everyone loves him. Since he became CEO in 2018, LULU has been going PARABOLIC. This guy is basically the Lisa Su of athleisure, and I know how you weebs love Su Bae.

&amp;#x200B;

# DD

1. Have you guys ever been inside a fucking Lululemon store? I went over the holidays to do some shopping with my tendies, and there was a huge ass line and stuff was flying off the shelves. I couldn't find half of the stuff in my size. I talked to the store associate and they said that they get inventory EVERY DAY, and that I could come back the next day. I did first thing in the morning and there was my size of stretchy chino pants for $128. Now think about it: does this sound like a company that has issues with supply chain or demand to you? Absolutely not. I guarantee their Q4 earnings are going to be insane.
2. Who are LULU's customers? Rich girls and boys with daddy's money who want to spend $100 on a fucking shirt. These aren't people who are hurting from losing their robs, these are people who are cooped up indoors and want to online shop so that when this summer comes around and everyone has vaccines, they have a ton of new stretchy expensive athletic wear to show off to the world. All the rich people with their new pelotons want something to spend their money on, and it's Lululemon. 
3. Have you ever worn these pants? They are insanely comfy and I look good as hell. I'm gonna buy more, and I showed my friends and family and they are all going to get some too. They also do free alterations in-store which is great customer service. A company like this has got to be successful. 

tl;dr - LULU 6/18 C $540

Title: Novus Capital SPAC (read: AppHarvest)
Alright so apologies in advance if this isn't good enough to be here with what I include. As a prelude to this, I am a professional within the industry this stock operates in, not quite an autist retard who has stumbled across a cool stock. 

So, AppHarvest is an agri-tech company that is soon to be going public. They operate large greenhouses in Kentucky. They have already had a huge amount of funding over the past two years, completed their first greenhouse construction a few months back and planted their first crop. They have already started on their next greenhouse which will double their capacity. They grow fresh produce 365 days a year, their location allows them to access about 75% of the US population within a 10 hour drive (which is absolutely huge in terms of freshness and driving sales).

They are going to be marketing their produce under one of the bigger brands over there in USA/Canada (Sunset Produce), I don't believe this to be a huge factor because ultimately demand&gt;supply with their specific product to the market. But, it still helps to have a popular label for sure.

They operate high tech greenhouses, which have been perfected in Holland as a profitable business. The private investment in Europe for high tech greenhouses is huge, the returns are consistent and reliable and the thing is, the margins in the US are even greater because you're not bound to a lot of the rules in force in the EU. Energy price is a very big one, overall per KwH in the US at the moment you're literally looking at 30-50% cheaper electricity than places like Holland and the UK. Energy is the biggest cost next to labour within greenhouse grown produce and we still make it work over here.

Considering AppHarvest have plans to basically triple their current operations (at least) over the next 5 years or so, I don't see how getting in on Novus Capital before it merges and becomes AppHarvest isn't a good bet.

The information at the minute about an actual merger date isn't there, the best that has been said is before the end of Q4. Personally, I understand they planted their first tomato crop in November, which by my reckoning means they will have their first saleable produce by mid-late January, so I can see it happening around the time their first produce hits the shelves.

I've written this as a professional within the industry, although from the UK. Whether that means anything around here, probably not. But at least as far as it not being a great DD post then yeah, I say it so I can indeed answer further questions on why I believe it's a very good bet. It's a business that by default offers long term, reliable returns, with the added benefit of significant short term expansion plans.

I always see on here a shit tonne of posts as soon as there's some fresh news within the cannabis industry. Well look at it this way, the high tech cannabis growing companies are run by ex-fresh produce growers, utilising technology built for growing fresh produce, only with this we aren't waiting on legislation.

Title: A real nice mining play (GENM)
Came across a potentially big play. Generation mining is sitting on the largest palladium project in north america and Eric Sprott has just begun financing the company on the 22nd (A famous Canadian Billionaire who has most of his assets in gold and silver). 

&amp;#x200B;

Their Feasibility project is meant to finish in the first quarter of 2021 and right now the share price is only 0.70$.

Title: Perion - Very Undervalued with MASSIVE upside
 If you missed the run on Magnite, or The Trade Desk then here's your chance to invest in the advertising space that will crush the market in 2021. Perion recently extended the deal with Microsoft and has been working with MSFT for over 10 years.

\- Perion raised its Q4 revenue to $100M-$105M from $81M-$91M vs. $86.14M consensus

\- Stellar Q3 earnings. Beats on revenue and EPS. Revenue growth of 27% YoY

\- Company is well-positioned to reap the benefits of ads increase in the CTV space

\- Consistently has been decreasing debts every quarter

\- Partnership with Microsoft has definitely provided brand recognition

\- The digital advertising and CTV space has been red hot in 2020 and has more than enough reasons to attract more $$$$$ in 2021

\- As of 12/28, the stock has taken a massive dip so it's trading at an unbelievable discounted price and options are very cheap too!

\- WAYYYYY undervalued stock right now when compared against its competitors:

1. EV/Revenue = 1.3x (vs 59x for TTD or 19x for MGNI)
2. Price/Sales = 0.55x (vs 61x for TTD or 14x for MGNI)

Just a couple of metrics to show how undervalued the company is right now and the massive upside it has to offer!

**TL;DR**: Buy and enjoy the massive upside!

**Risk?** Apart from short term market fluctuations, nothing really! Again, please do your own DD as well.

Title: $BBBY - Short squeeze imminent
Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is a legacy retailer that is written off. 61% of the float is short this stock. 

They got a new CEO Mark Tritton end of last year. Mark Tritton transformed Target - TGT went from 50 to 176. He is doing it again at BBBY 

They sold lot of non-core stuff - sold [personlizationmall.com](https://personlizationmall.com), one kings lane, christmas tree shops, etc - the company went from 1.2B in debt to 200m in cash. They have also done a lot of changes to improve the business like reduce inventory, add omnichannel support, beyond+ - like prime, etc. The company posted positive comps. \*\* There is a 170 page [investor day presentation](http://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/static-files/2730f3a3-1969-414e-bd30-3fcf49e321d4) to see all the changes have done and will be doing \*\*

It trades dirty cheap - 9B+ in sales, 900m in profit expected. 2.34B market cap. 200m net cash. 

They have a $825m share buyback upsized from $650m ! Large part of this is Accelerated Share Repurchase (short term). Remember 61% short - this ASR is bound to kill shorts ! 

All hail Lord Tritton

I looked at around 87 Merged SPACs to find Average time it takes from DA Announcement to Merger Date. And its **126 days** on average. This will help us decide when to enter a SPAC with DA to use Merger Vote as catalyst to for gains!!!

Title: JOYY is a fraud
Ticker is Y Y. They are a chinese company that is basically Chaturbate but not porn, or Reddit live streams. They supposedly make money from taking a percentage of gifts to broadcasters. 

Muddy Waters Research released a short report on them a month ago that claimed that the majority of their revenue is fabricated. It's pretty convincing and detailed. The most famous earners on JOYY are terribly uninteresting and literally sit around doing nothing while broadcasting. Muddy Waters alleges that a lot of the "gifts" are from bots and/or are recycled from users or are being gifted by themselves. 

It has a market cap of 6.4 B which seems a lot for chinese Reddit streams. It has been falling pretty steadily for the last few weeks. 

The written report is pretty boring. This video Muddy made gets the point across a lot smoother (it is corny though): [https://www.zer0es.tv/big-announcements/the-exposing-of-joyy-inc/](https://www.zer0es.tv/big-announcements/the-exposing-of-joyy-inc/)

My next play is $APHA Jan 15 $9.00/$10.00C

**TLDR** for you retards that cant read

***Data Driven: Beating Earnings***

Canada Recreational sales show continued growth

New Store openings in Ontario provide massive growth opportunities

$APHA dominates Ontario market share in Vape, Pre-roll and Dried Flower categories

$APHA maintains #1 market share in Canada

 ***Speculative: To the Moon*** 

A Democratic sweep in the Georgia Senate run-off election on Jan 5 would be a major catalyst for US Marijuana Legalization ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/georgia-senate-runoff-elections-critical-to-legal-weed-s-future))([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kriskrane/2020/12/02/the-chance-for-marijuana-legalization-rests-in-georgia/?sh=6f921f6b1455))

Tilray and Aphria Merger (Tilrays largest shareholder is Peter Thiels private equity fund)

&amp;#x200B;

***Data Driven DD: Beating Earnings***

Ontario Store Count: 

**Last Q: 150**  **This Q: 255**

Retail stores are the main driver of growth in the Canadian market, with most of the growth coming from store openings in Ontario. With a population of nearly 15 million people, it is by far the largest market in Canada(currently accounts for 28.6% of national sales) and up until June only had 70 retail stores open. As of December 1st there were 255 retail stores open, with 106 of those store openings coming during this quarter, a **71%** increase from the previous Q.

&amp;#x200B;

[Store Openings this Q](https://preview.redd.it/a3dgzwnzgy761.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d814583986fb7625298fccb7acf7498c2e29664f)

  

**Canada Sales**

https://preview.redd.it/rybo0cz2hy761.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afa860ae673e83298e217f4dafae906d704a0b2c

Health Canada releases sales data on the Canadian Recreational market every month, which effectively confirms that there is continued growth in the market. Sales increased in both September(2%) and October(5%) and I anticipate we see a larger jump in November due to a large amount of store openings in mid-October to early November. Aphria has shown its ability to continually grow with the Canadian market, as long as they maintain their industry leading market share in Canada we should see this trend continue.

**Brand Success**

Kind recently published their brands of the year award, determined by over 150 budtenders in Canada. Each of Aphrias brands won an award, with the exception of B!NGO which launched in August. My focus on branding is specific to 3 product categories; Dried Flower, Vapes and Pre-Rolls, which make up **86%** of Canadian sales. The data below was collected using Headset, which tracks the top 10 selling products by category, updated weekly.  

**Pre Rolls**\- 12% of the Canadian Market and 12% of Aphrias Rec Revenues

**Kind Award**: Indica Pre-Roll of the Year: *RIFF*\- Subway Scientist

Aphria dominates the Pre-Roll market, their Jean Guy strain sat at #1 for the month of September and their Royal Highness strain took over the #1 spot for all of October and November. They boasted the top 6 best-selling products for September and maintained 4 of the top 5 spots for October and November. Aphrias brands were #1 in pre-rolled market share in Canada last Q, a trend that will continue into this Q.

**Vapes**\- 15% of the Canadian Market and 14% of Aphrias Rec Revenues

**Kind Award**: Indica Cartridge of the Year: *Good Supply*\- Purple Monkey 

Sativa Cartridge of the Year: *Good Supply*\- Tangie Kush

Hybrid Cartridge of the Year: *Good Supply*\- Pineapple Express

Another category that Aphria dominates, their Blue Dream strain held the #1 spot for the month of September while their Pineapple Express strain held onto #1 for October and November. They held 3 of top 5 best-selling vapes for September and October, and 2 of the top 5 spots for November. They had 4 products in the Top 10 from October to November and a recent PR stated they held their #1 market share position in both Ontario and Alberta in the last 3 months, ending Oct 31. 

**Dried Flower**\- 59% of Canadian Market and 58% of Aphrias Rec Revenues

**Kind Award**: Craft Cannabis of the Year: *Broken Coast*

CBD Brand of the Year: *Solei*\- Free

Aphria has a strong presence in the Dried Flower market, with their Jean Guy strain being the #1 best-selling flower in October and November. They held 3 of the top 5 spots in September, 2 of the top 5 spots in October and 1 of the top 5 spots in November. At the end of August they launched their new discount brand B!NGO which targets the growing bulk-offering subcategory(15&amp;28G offerings). This move immediately undercut all competitors by offering the cheapest large format options, with ounces as low as $4.18/G, all the while maintaining competitive prices with their *Good Supply, RIFF* and *Solei* products.  This will be this first quarter we see sales from these bulk offerings and its no doubt this move is intended to propel them from #2 in dried flower market share in Canada to #1. 

**Additional German Cannabis Revenue**

In early October Aphria made their first shipment of medical cannabis from their Canadian facility to Germany. This cannabis will be distributed through Germany by their pharmaceutical company CC Pharma, a leading distributor of pharmaceutical products, with more than 13,000 pharmacies in Germany and Europe. They also launched several new CBD wellness brands in Germany, CannRelief, Evoque and CannaPet. Products under the CannRelief brand consist of cosmetic oils, creams and supplements. Evoque provides natural and sustainable products, such as face creams and serums. CannaPet provides products designed to help with relaxation, relief and recovery of pets. All of these products are distributed through CC Pharma and will provide a new revenue stream for Aphria. 

**Speculative: MOON POTENTIAL**

***Georgia Senate Runoff***

The most important vote thus far in the cannabis industry. If the Democrats sweep the Jan 5 senate run-off election, they would flip senate control. This would be the largest catalyst for US legalization we have seen, and the sector hype will be all you guys talk about. With a Democrat majority in the Senate, the MORE Act; which would remove cannabis from the Controlled Substance Act would see the senate floor and likely pass; the bills sponsor is Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. The SAFE Banking Act would also hit the senate floor and likely pass, allowing banks to serve the Cannabis industry. Most importantly would be full on federal legalization, while Biden has supported decriminalization, a senate &amp; house majority and nearly 60% of adults supporting legalization could push him towards federal legalization. 

***Aphria-Tilray Merger, Sweetwater acquisition***

Aphria has made a big splash in the US space in recent weeks, with the acquisition of Sweetwater Brewing and more recently merging with Tilray. SweetWater is one of the largest independent craft brewers in the US with flagship 420 beverages and award-winning beers. Aphria will immediately be able to sell beverages under the Solei and RIFF brands in the US with SweetWaters distribution infrastructure, giving them a major entry into the beverage market. Tilray is a US based cannabis company, backed by WSB favourite Peter Thiel and a JV with alcohol giant Anheuser-Busch, but more famously known for its epic run to $300 in 2017. With a leading market share in Canada and a solid cash balance, they will be able to focus on the lucrative US market. Leveraging their connections with Anheuser-Busch, Peter Thiel and former CEO of WholeFoods Walter Robb makes them an attractive favourite among investors. The merger will effectively create the largest Cannabis company in the world, and both Aphria and Tilray are set to benefit if the democrats take control of the Senate on Jan 5. (US MSOs arent listed on major exchanges, cant trade options on them)

Title: All aboard the 5G rocket
TLDR: buy $NOK and $ERIC Jan 2022 or 2023 calls 

Good morning retards.

5G is already starting to replace 4G and this will be accelerated in the next two years. 

5G will also provide the foundation for new technologies Autonomous vehicles, Telemedicine, "Smart factories" and IoT.

Until now, Huawei was leeding the race to deploy 5G worldwide, but they are slowly getting banned from many western countires. As the FCC declaired:  *Both \[Huawei and ZTE\] have close ties to the Chinese Communist Party and Chinas military apparatus, and both companies are broadly subject to Chinese law obligating them to cooperate with the countrys intelligence services We cannot and will not allow the Chinese Communist Party to exploit network vulnerabilities and compromise our critical communications infrastructure.* 

Huawei is loosing its market share and other companies will profit from it in the next couple years. 

$NOK and $ERIC are both very well positioned to benefit from the 5G deveopments and Huawei's downfall, as both companies have already secured more than a hundred 5G contracts. 

I believe that in the next years, as 5G becomes widely available, both of these copanies will grow a lot.

Note: You should have all your money in $GME and only buy these once Game Stop has mooned and you are looking for new tendies

Title: Renewables and latest COVID stimulus
The stimulus was signed today. The US market is expected to rally, but expect larger gains on the renewables market for the next few days.

The 2021 US budget, which includes the $900 billion COVID stimulus bill, also includes sweeping measures on combating climate change and push for renewable energy:

**$35 billion on renewable energy research and development**

This includes solar (*TAN*) and wind R&amp;D (*FAN*), upgrading the Energy department sustainable transport initiative (*XL sounds interesting*), developing decentralized smart energy grids (*GRID*), and high-risk R&amp;D.

**Tax credit extensions on renewable energy projects**

Solar projects get a two-year extension on tax credits, while onshore wind projects get an extra year. Offshore wind projects finally get its own tax credit, while carbon capture and waste-to-energy credits are extended as well.

Fuel cell vehicles get an extension (*PLUG, FCEL*), as well as electric motorcycles. Non-hydrogen fuel refueling installations also get an extension.

Energy-efficient home installations retain its tax credit. Energy projects in commercial buildings are now given permanent tax credit (*HASI is a close fit*).

**Other provisions**

Hydro-chlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are to be phased out in 15 years. Low-income families get additional subsidies to install renewable energy in their homes. Excise taxes on coal and oil are extended.

&amp;#x200B;

**Caveats and future events that could make or break the rally**

The Georgia senate runoff elections will dictate the control of the executive and legislative branches. A Republican win can stall the meteoric rise of renewables but it is still expected to gain significantly for 2021. Expect IV in renewables to be high for at least a week after the election, as the decision may not be finalized immediately.

**Recommendations**

It's never too late to hop on the renewables train.

Title: Are you ready for the massive 2021 tax season? A sleeping giant trade for the end of 2020 ($HRB)
2020 was a great year to trade the news. COVID, stimulus bill, cyberattack, and many countless other examples were news that the market only reacted to after a while, letting astute traders establish positions early before the pumps (or dumps) began.

So what is the biggest developing story in 2021?

It's the 2021 tax season.

Tens of millions of people started trading in 2020, probably including you, fellow retard. Robinhood's userbase alone went up by 30% in mid June. What does this mean for 2021? Well all these traders need to pay taxes.

The best tax season play is $HRB.

Here's why. H&amp;R Block is a pure-play tax prep company specializing in doing taxes for you or an online tax prep software. If you did a bunch of trading in 2020, you need special tax help, because online tax prep software doesn't handle important rules like wash sales or capital loss carryover. Miss a wash sale here or there and expect Mr. John IRS to give you a knock on the door for a special consulation (   )

HRB also has a small market cap of 2.8B and a low P/E of 15.2. Management is seeing a massive rebound from COVID lows and continues to pay the 7% dividend and also bought back $150 million in shares last quarter. \[All wall street analysts give it a price target of $21\]([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/hrb/analyst-research](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/hrb/analyst-research)).

97% of HRB shares are also owned by institutions.

So you might think $INTU is a good play, and you're not wrong, but the biggest  potential is $HRB. $INTU is overbought and focused on self-service tax prep for normies while $HRB is a better tax prep company for traders and is also undervalued.

Buy low and sell high. Position yourself for the 2021 tax season with  $HRB 

Title: Vaccine Boosters Could Be Needed 153 Days After 2nd Dose
TITLE: Vaccine Boosters Could Be Needed 153 days after second dose.

**Microbiology PHD estimates there have already been 100k reinfections**

&gt;In actuality, there are most likely around 50,000-100,000 reinfections in the world, excluding asymptomatic first or second infections which may not have been caught on either screening.[[0]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kj6f2s/observational_study_on_healthcare_workers/ggv298c/)

Reinfections are common given the opportunity [[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/khsw6u/scientists_urge_concern_not_alarm_over_new_virus/ggo8qir/). Reinfections can be used to estimate anti-body half life for anti-bodies created by the vaccine. [[2]](https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/antibody+half-life). Reinfections can also be used as an indicator for B cell immunity, as B cell immunity created via an infection is the same as B cell immunity created by a vaccine. [[3]](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html). **Reinfections indicate anti-body half life is short and B cell immunity is weak**. This implies booster shots are needed but bi-annual vaccine boosters are not logistically feasible.

Antigenic drift can reduce efficacy rapidly. Its not possible to vaccinate for multiple versions bi-annually. [[4]](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1340409968818671616?s=20). "Immune Evasion" can already be seen occuring in the South African strain [[5]](https://sciencespeaksblog.org/2020/12/22/covid-19-south-african-variant-may-be-worse-than-uk-variant/). Suspiciously, there are also 1594 untested and suspected cases in fda report for pfizer vaccine, in vaccinated group. [[6]](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download). 

**The Moderna Vaccines Antibodies May Not Last As Long As We Hoped**

&gt;A significant determinant of vaccines effectiveness in controlling a pandemic is antibody durationhow long the antibodies last in a persons system. [[7]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2020/12/22/the-moderna-vaccines-antibodies-may-not-last-as-long-as-we-hoped/)

**A Prospective Study on Rapidly Declining SARSCoV2 IgG Antibodies Within One to Three Months of Testing IgG Positive**

&gt;**Conclusions**
&gt;Our findings show that the protective COVID-19 IgG antibodies rapidly decline over one to three months. Rapidly decaying protective IgG antibodies would impact herd immunity and vaccine durability. It is critical for the potential vaccines to generate both protective T- and B-cell immune responses in a sustained manner. [[8]](https://www.cureus.com/articles/46453-a-prospective-study-on-rapidly-declining-sarscov2-igg-antibodies-within-one-to-three-months-of-testing-igg-positive-can-it-lead-to-potential-reinfections)

**Anti-body half life can be determined from the following equation.** [[10]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life)

&gt;Nt = No  (0.5)  ^ (t / thalf)

&gt;10 = 100  (0.5) ^ (90 / thalf)

&gt;0.10 = (0.5) ^ (90 / thalf)

&gt;ln(0.10) = ln(0.5)  (90 / thalf)

&gt; thalf = (90  ln(0.5)) / ln(0.10)

&gt; thalf = 27 days

A vaccine would provide up to 4 times the initial anti-body count as a natural infection. 

**Re-run the equation to find how long it would take for anti-bodies, provided by a vaccine, to drop below the critical threshold.**

&gt;10 = 400  (0.5) ^ (t / 27)

&gt; ln(0.025) = ln(0.5)  (t / 27)

&gt; t = (27  ln(0.025)) / ln(0.5)

&gt; t = 143 days

Stonks fall fast. Spy 315p 6/9/21 (Fauci's expected booster date)

**TL;DR**: Anti-body half life is short. B cells immunity is weak due as indicated by reinfections (100k estimated). Vaccine boosters needed ~143 days after second dose (+10 to 12 days to reach max anti-body count), or bi-annually.

&gt;Bonus Points: The 100k reinfection estimate sourced from a PHD in Microbiology / Immonology AND is also in charge of ordering bootser shots [[9]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kj6f2s/observational_study_on_healthcare_workers/ggv4kmm/)



Title: $U DD: There has never been anything like it
**Where they are:**  
You've probably heard of Unity and the reputation of Unity games. But did you know that Unity commands 70% of the top 100 app store games? Almost half of all mobile games now are made using Unity.

Okay so big deal I hear you say, they're big. But everyone knows their reputation, all shit games, right? Wrong! Not only do they dominate the mobile market but even AAA studios love Unity.

A few small names powered by Unity:

* Hearthstone
* Pokmon GO
* Rust
* Wasteland 2
* 7 Days to Die
* Kerbal Space Program
* RISK: Global Domination
* Firewatch
* Escape from Tarkov
* GTFO

Or any other number of massively successful titles &amp; AAA studios which use this fantastic engine:  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Unity\_games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unity_games)

**Growth Potential:**  
Unity has always been vocal, not only about expanding what they're doing in the game industry but with software far outside of just video games. Aquarium touch screens? Unity. Business deep-learning prediction software? Unity. Virtual museum? Unity.

But what makes their plans for the future more special is their new scriptable render pipeline. Originally Unity was meant to be an out-of-the-box "One size fits all" model so that as many different games could be made with it as possible. With the introduction of the scriptable render pipeline they've now introduced URP and HDRP. So what does that mean?

Knowing all the ins-and-outs of Unity was what was originally required for making a game look good. You had to know about the package manager, about how to make good post processing, etc. Now with HDRP &amp; URP you get a premade choice. URP if you're going for mobile or performance. HDRP if you're going for AAA quality. Unreal Engine's starting to look dated by comparison!

**Why has there never been anything like it?**  
Companies prior to around 2012 always had to write their own engines from the ground up usually in hard-to-program frameworks and in intensive languages like C++. Now games have become so complex that companies are opting to license out to software like Unity or Unreal Engine.

What makes Unity special though is that this is the first time that a third party game engine has gone public. Literally history in the making. Millions of game developers and investors across the world immediately began pouring money into the stock and its increased in value over 100%. The stock opened September 18th @ $75 and is already valued at $166.

With the massive growth of companies in and outside of game development switching to Unity the company is seeing unprecedented levels of growth. And with their introduction of the scriptable render pipeline &amp; HDRP they now even threaten Unreal Engine's advantage which was primarily in graphics. Not to mention the large asset store, a mini free market where developers can put up their own paid game assets which Unity taxes every sale of. Models, Scripts, Audio, you name it. And with it being all virtual there's little overhead.

What's more is that similar to Windows or Apple, Unity inspires loyalty among its users who believe in it. This immediately meant that software engineers, game designers, and more began investing in it. And the better it does, the more those who waited jump on board.

This concludes my wsb talk.

oh and one more thing..     $U TO THE MOON BABY!

Title: $GME DD: Why This Isnt Blockbuster
Lets cut the mustard: Blockbuster pioneered in movie rentals. In a time when internet couldnt feasibly download a movie. When compression of said movies sucked extra hard. Blockbuster got defeated by high speed Internet, torrents, and the ability to simply stream a movie.

Hands up, who here would play Stadia alone? You, Mr. PC who has a mouse that crushes every crossplay console player who dares try and snipe you? Can you simply download games for full price and not feel jealous that at GameStop, I paid exactly the same as you, BUT I got the OST on disk with a bunch of cool other goodies?

My local GameStop in Brooklyn was SLAMMED today. Literally one lone 3DS in black for $120 used but the case that should have many other preowned consoles in it, completely empty. I went to buy my daughter a Pikachu plushie (albeit let her pick which one) and they were ALL GONE. Like, not a single plushie. Used games? Racked out. Even watched a father with two sons who justified why they needed a Cyberpunk Keanu Reeves collectible model but playing on PC, Cyberpunk blows. PS5 and Series X orders? Good luck, sold out SOLID. Tons of families convincing kids to settle for used games.

If you truly think GameStop is Blockbuster, think again. If I wanted a game for cheap, best believe some Instagram hypebeast or kid with no money traded in the game I want to play for cheap. Shiet, even got an original Jet Set Radio Future with Sega GT 2002 disk for OG XBox from here since Im waiting for the hype to die down and get a Series X to play with my daughter and wife on.

If they get a used copy of Fusion Frenzy, Im all over it.

Point being: its easy to think Amazon and blah blah can sell games, or just download on steam. But a lot of people from what I see not only love games, but merchandise from them. You cant check quality online. You order, get sorely disappointed and wait another week for your refund to hit. 

GameStop is for the OGs who let their daughter tell daddy she wants a Pokeball Bean Bag Chair for $99.99 because I never considered it, but seeing it?

Even my wife wants it.

Title: The Ultimate Parlay: DraftKings ($DKNG)
Here on a Sunday night to give you autists some time to cross-check my info, start your RH instant deposit, and let your wife's bf know you're coming back with a vengeance. Here's an in-depth analysis on DraftKings and how to maximize profits over the foreseeable future to squeeze this for every tendie we can. Now that many states face revenue shortfalls due to the coronavirus pandemic and wider budget deficits, there needs to be a push to fill that gap and nothing is better positioned than sports betting.

As you all know, $DKNG came to market through a SPAC merging with Diamond Eagle back in April, at the worst of the pandemic when live sports were dead and there was more uncertainty than ever for what was to come. Jason Robins, Draft Kings CEO, has balls of steel and knew that they needed to get to market quickly for a sports betting run-up the likes of which we've never seen. Sports are now on their way back, with a huge amount of positive catalysts coming up in the next few months to skyrocket this stock to the moon and beyond.

# Management

I want to clarify that a large amount of my conviction from this play comes from the incredible management team leading the company. CEO Jason Robins is a stand-up guy and has led the company through a huge amount of scrutiny since its founding in 2012. He comes from a data analytics background which could not be a better fit for the sports betting business. He prioritizes the high speed data that fuels the DraftKings platform as its most valuable asset and speaks often on the commitment his team has to ethical values and encouraging a trustworthy environment for its users to gamble their paychecks on the DraftKings platform.

I've linked a great interview to get to know the CEO and give further insight into DraftKing's plans moving forward below and highly recommend anyone going in on this play give it a quick watch. Jason is optimistic about the future of state's legalizing mobile sports betting moving forward and says they will continue to invest boatloads of money into customer acquisition costs through TV ads and billboards on a state-by-state basis. Link: [https://youtu.be/2OVFB9piEC0](https://youtu.be/2OVFB9piEC0)

Any of you who have come across DraftKings commercials, YouTube ads, billboards, know that their marketing is on point. This is a great play because DraftKing's expansion has occurred thus far on a state-by-state basis. This means that there's a large part of the nation (actually the majority) that is still ignorant to the sports betting wave that is coming in 2021. DraftKings is positioned extremely well to lead the way into the \~25 states still waiting to pass the bill.

# Legislation

The fact that the top 4 states in the country still have not legalized online sports betting presents a HUGE opportunity to ride this wave with little downside risk. Sports have already gone through the worst-case scenario during COVID shutdowns and survivednow weve got a great amount of positive catalysts coming up (NBA season, March madness, Super Bowl, etc.) that the general population is begging for some action on, paired with more money in their pocket from significantly less entertainment costs since the pandemic started.

The Wuhan Virus gave DraftKings a shot in the arm to streamline its way into most (if not all) of the remaining state's ballots during Q1 and Q2 due to the huge cut in tax revenues that the lockdowns caused across the country. Governor Cuomo of New York released a statement last week stating he is now considering the passing of mobile sports betting in order to raise the state's tax revenue during a time where Congress completely skipped them over in terms of providing aid through the stimmy. New York is a huge catalyst moving forward. In my opinion, this is a make or break for how things look for DraftKings moving forward, and will largely influence how other states react. Mobile sports betting scares states as it is new and so accessible, but if you do research into the Powerball and other loterry companies, it just took a push in the right direction for states to realize how much money they are leaving on the table by not participating in these emerging markets. Sports betting has already benefited the 9 states which passed the bill (NJ leading the way) and has NY as well as every other governor, feeling major FOMO.

Current states where online (mobile) sports betting laws have passed:

* New Jersey
* West Virginia
* Indiana
* Pennsylvania
* New Hampshire
* Iowa
* Colorado
* Illinois
* Tennessee

Some of the reported revenues from sports betting:

**New Jersey:** $931.6 million

**Pennsylvania:** $491.9 million

**Illinois:** $434 million

**Indiana:** $250.8 million

**Colorado:** $231.2 million

&amp;#x200B;

[On May 14, 2018, the United States Supreme Court found the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act \(PASPA\), the federal law prohibiting states from authorizing sports betting, to be unconstitutional. It is now up to individual states to decide if they want to authorize and regulate sports betting in their state. Congress can also take action on the authorization and regulation of sports betting but has so far left it up to individual states.](https://preview.redd.it/dxnojqu80u761.png?width=2060&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc94391759232c4e1337d8af2b2cf1cfcb090141)

As you can see, states are cashing out on the mobile sports betting wave, with New Jersey leading the way and making a large part of that revenue from NY residents crossing state lines to get their gambling fix in. Gov. Cuomo has been opposed to legalizing sports betting in the past, calling it "a violation of the constitution"...buut that was before covid lockdowns and his state was drowning up to their neck in debt.

DraftKings management issued extremely bullish guidance without even taking into account new states passing legislation. This is one of the things that I love about CEO Jason Robins that stood out to me in the hours of interviews/articles Ive looked over. This man is the pinnacle of **underpromising and over delivering**. The staff at Draft Kings are extremely customer centric and focused on strong ethics to help them provide a platform for sports aficionados to enhance their viewing experience.

# Data-Driven/Proprietary Tech Stack (the MOAT)

Legislation aside, the other huge catalyst is DraftKing's unique approach to owning its own data and proprietary tech stack. I believe that this will be where DKNG separates itself from the competition that is rushing to this space and will give it the upper hand in acquiring, and retaining, a large percentage of new users across opening states.

**From investor presentation:** *"Upon close of the business combination, DraftKings will become the only vertically-integrated pure-play sports betting and online gaming company based in the United States. Through the business combination, DraftKings expects to realize synergies by transitioning its risk and trading sports betting platform to SBTechs, instead of relying on a third-party platform. In addition to reducing costs, DraftKings will control its backend system and product roadmap, differentiating the company from other U.S. operators and giving it the ability to tailor its sports betting product to U.S. sports and users."*

*"SBTech is a global leader in omni-channel sports betting and gaming, with more than 1,200 employees in 10 offices worldwide. Since 2007, the group has developed the industrys most powerful online sports betting and casino platform, serving licensees in more than 15 regulated territories. SBTechs clients include many of the worlds premier betting and gaming operators, state lotteries, land-based casinos, horse racing companies, and iGaming start-ups. The group supplies highly flexible betting and gaming solutions to clients looking for exceptional configurability and the quickest route to market, complemented by proven business intelligence and reporting capabilities. The SBTech offering includes its seamless sportsbook, Chameleon360 iGaming platform, managed services, on-property sportsbook and omni-channel solutions that provide players with constant access to sports and casino products across all online, mobile and retail channels. Supported by unrivaled expertise in trading and risk management, acquisition and CRM, and the highest standards of regulatory compliance, SBTechs partners consistently achieve rapid growth, enhanced brand loyalty and record revenues."*

DraftKings prioritized **OWNING** their own backend technology via this merger with SBTech, making them the first, and only company in this space to own their risk and trading platform. This gives DraftKings a *huge* edge to the rest of the market. It forked up the cash to keep everything in house not only to provide a better customer experience, but also to widen the moat against competitors as new states come onboard. The key here is to clarify that DraftKings and SBTech combined to be the only player in the market with 100% vertical integration and control of their own backend. Jason Robins and the rest of the management team are placing their efforts on having the best technology and the best product and really going all in on owning the U.S. landscape opening up, with as little need for cross-platform interaction as possible.

This acquisition of SBTech was a complete game changer because it allowed them to be independent from paying revenue share to a third-party for betting lines and risk management services.

**Clarification: no other sports betting/fantasy sports/casino company currently has 100% vertical integration on the level that DraftKings has established.**

# iGaming Boom

This is where the market is missing the mark. Take the time to read over analyst reports, news articles, and interviews and you'll quickly notice 99% of the general market is completely glazing over DraftKing's iGaming sector. This industry has been a CA$H COW in Europe for awhile now, and is only getting started in the United States. Out of the companies that occupy this space, DraftKings is the only one to create one synergistic platform for Fantasy sports/Sportsbook/iGaming. This will be a huge value proposition that will ultimately rocket DraftKings to the top of the gaming market and solidify it as THE gaming powerhouse moving forward.

&amp;#x200B;

[The infrastructure driving DraftKing's products and Tech \(all in one platform\)](https://preview.redd.it/t7x2af1k0u761.png?width=2156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8630f1eb26f047e004675572a4288b8eb183f9e2)

Anyone that's watched the run of Skillz and the hype pushing PaySafe, knows how much anticipation there is for iGaming to become the new norm in the world of gambling. DraftKings has emerged as the market leader in each state they've launched in, and continue to gain more and more market share. Once new users get introduced to their platform, the cross-selling opportunity is limitless and creates an extremely sticky customer acquisition cycle.

Competitors like Penn and MGM are dinosaurs in this space and have been playing catch-up to DraftKings since 2012. The new age of gamblers don't want to drive to a physical casino location or buy a home desktop to gamble. Everything will be mobile and run in real-time. DraftKings has been building an incredible live-sports ecosystem (first to market) and innovates the possibilities of what you can bet on a daily basis. Just download the app for yourself and do some exploring. I believe this is going to boom in the TikTok/millennial crowd as more states start to hop onboard.

# 2021 Projections

Pulled from the investor presentation, $DKNG has smashed every one of their 2020 assumptions listed below. For any stats guys out there, I would love to see some models at how much of this market is still up for grabs. DraftKings has positioned themselves to be at the head of this movement, and I believe that 2021 will be the year we really see them take off into triple digits share prices.

The catalysts are there, and the market is ripe for the taking. Their projections are extremely conservative and management lets the numbers do the talking. In my opinion, this is a bet on the management putting the dots together to EXECUTE as state legislation starts to go their way, once NY happens this shift will occur *rapidly.*

The management is incredible and truly displays a vision for wanting to prop up shareholder value in the long-term through valuable data, a fully integrated platform, and aggressive customer acquisition to take control of this market as states realize the economic deficits which they are facing going into a new year. This along with the unprecedented hype that is going to be involved with sports events this year, will skyrocket DraftKings to new heights.

This is not a bet on sports betting alone, it is a play on a data-heavy and analytically driven behemoth, with strategic partnerships (league, team, and celebrity partnerships) and one of the most aggressive marketing strategies I have ever laid eyes on. The stock soared earlier this years upon news of the Michael Jordan partnership ([https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/02/investing/draftkings-michael-jordan-deal/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/02/investing/draftkings-michael-jordan-deal/index.html)) and there is many, many more big moves in the pipeline.

# Conclusion

Long-term I am extremely bullish on people wanting risk to make up a daily part of their lives. The psychology of sports betting resembles that of the lottery and is becoming a must-have for people to have the choice to place bets from the convenience of their mobile phones. We are moving into a future where if risk and leverage are not involved, people will have little interest in dedicating their time to things. This shift can be seen with the boom in retail options trading (shoutout wsb gang) and will have a similar effect in sports, iGaming, and random prop bets/surveys that Draft Kings is innovating heavily in. This is not to mention the infrastructure that DKNG is continuing to build out to rival that of Europe in terms of live sports betting (which makes up three quarters of revenue for online sports books in the UK) and expanding their horizons to lesser betted on sports such as tennis, golf, soccer, etc.

If you've gotten this far, congrats you're just a few steps away from striking gold. Any feedback, comments, rebuttals, bear scenarios, etc. please comment. Good luck.

Title: The Ultimate Parlay: DraftKings ($DKNG)
Here on a Sunday night to give you autists some time to cross-check my info, start your RH instant deposit, and let your wife's bf know you're coming back with a vengeance. Here's an in-depth analysis on DraftKings and how to maximize profits over the foreseeable future to squeeze this for every tendie we can. Now that many states face revenue shortfalls due to the coronavirus pandemic and wider budget deficits, there needs to be a push to fill that gap and nothing is better positioned than sports betting.

As you all know, $DKNG came to market through a SPAC merging with Diamond Eagle back in April, at the worst of the pandemic when live sports were dead and there was more uncertainty than ever for what was to come. Jason Robins, Draft Kings CEO, has balls of steel and knew that they needed to get to market quickly for a sports betting run-up the likes of which we've never seen. Sports are now on their way back, with a huge amount of positive catalysts coming up in the next few months to skyrocket this stock to the moon and beyond. 

# Management 

I want to clarify that a large amount of my conviction from this play comes from the incredible management team leading the company. CEO Jason Robins is a stand-up guy and has led the company through a huge amount of scrutiny since its founding in 2012. He comes from a data analytics background which could not be a better fit for the sports betting business. He prioritizes the high speed data that fuels the DraftKings platform as its most valuable asset and speaks often on the commitment his team has to ethical values and encouraging a trustworthy environment for its users to gamble their paychecks on the DraftKings platform. 

I've linked a great interview to get to know the CEO and give further insight into DraftKing's plans moving forward below and highly recommend anyone going in on this play give it a quick watch. Jason is optimistic about the future of state's legalizing mobile sports betting moving forward and says they will continue to invest boatloads of money into customer acquisition costs through TV ads and billboards on a state-by-state basis. Link: [https://youtu.be/2OVFB9piEC0](https://youtu.be/2OVFB9piEC0)

Any of you who have come across DraftKings commercials, YouTube ads, billboards, know that their marketing is on point. This is a great play because DraftKing's expansion has occurred thus far on a state-by-state basis. This means that there's a large part of the nation (actually the majority) that is still ignorant to the sports betting wave that is coming in 2021. DraftKings is positioned extremely well to lead the way into the \~25 states still waiting to pass the bill. 

# Legislation

The fact that the top 4 states in the country still have not legalized online sports betting presents a HUGE opportunity to ride this wave with little downside risk. Sports have already gone through the worst-case scenario during COVID shutdowns and survivednow weve got a great amount of positive catalysts coming up (NBA season, March madness, Super Bowl, etc.) that the general population is begging for some action on, paired with more money in their pocket from significantly less entertainment costs since the pandemic started.

The Wuhan Virus gave DraftKings a shot in the arm to streamline its way into most (if not all) of the remaining state's ballots during Q1 and Q2 due to the huge cut in tax revenues that the lockdowns caused across the country. Governor Cuomo of New York released a statement last week stating he is now considering the passing of mobile sports betting in order to raise the state's tax revenue during a time where Congress completely skipped them over in terms of providing aid through the stimmy. New York is a huge catalyst moving forward. In my opinion, this is a make or break for how things look for DraftKings moving forward, and will largely influence how other states react. Mobile sports betting scares states as it is new and so accessible, but if you do research into the Powerball and other loterry companies, it just took a push in the right direction for states to realize how much money they are leaving on the table by not participating in these emerging markets. Sports betting has already benefited the 9 states which passed the bill (NJ leading the way) and has NY as well as every other governor, feeling major FOMO. 

Current states where online (mobile) sports betting laws have passed:

* New Jersey
* West Virginia 
* Indiana 
* Pennsylvania 
* New Hampshire 
* Iowa 
* Colorado 
* Illinois 
* Tennessee 

*Processing img g497599xps661...*

Some of the reported revenues from sports betting:

**New Jersey:** $931.6 million 

**Pennsylvania:** $491.9 million 

**Illinois:** $434 million 

**Indiana:** $250.8 million 

**Colorado:** $231.2 million

As you can see, states are cashing out on the mobile sports betting wave, with New Jersey leading the way and making a large part of that revenue from NY residents crossing state lines to get their gambling fix in. Gov. Cuomo has been opposed to legalizing sports betting in the past, calling it "a violation of the constitution"...buut that was before covid lockdowns and his state was drowning up to their neck in debt.

DraftKings management issued extremely bullish guidance without even taking into account new states passing legislation. This is one of the things that I love about CEO Jason Robins that stood out to me in the hours of interviews/articles Ive looked over. This man is the pinnacle of **underpromising and over delivering**. The staff at Draft Kings are extremely customer centric and focused on strong ethics to help them provide a platform for sports aficionados to enhance their viewing experience.

# Data-Driven/Proprietary Tech Stack (the MOAT)

Legislation aside, the other huge catalyst is DraftKing's unique approach to owning its own data and proprietary tech stack. I believe that this will be where DKNG separates itself from the competition that is rushing to this space and will give it the upper hand in acquiring, and retaining, a large percentage of new users across opening states. 

**From investor presentation:** *"Upon close of the business combination, DraftKings will become the only vertically-integrated pure-play sports betting and online gaming company based in the United States. Through the business combination, DraftKings expects to realize synergies by transitioning its risk and trading sports betting platform to SBTechs, instead of relying on a third-party platform. In addition to reducing costs, DraftKings will control its backend system and product roadmap, differentiating the company from other U.S. operators and giving it the ability to tailor its sports betting product to U.S. sports and users."*

*"SBTech is a global leader in omni-channel sports betting and gaming, with more than 1,200 employees in 10 offices worldwide. Since 2007, the group has developed the industrys most powerful online sports betting and casino platform, serving licensees in more than 15 regulated territories. SBTechs clients include many of the worlds premier betting and gaming operators, state lotteries, land-based casinos, horse racing companies, and iGaming start-ups. The group supplies highly flexible betting and gaming solutions to clients looking for exceptional configurability and the quickest route to market, complemented by proven business intelligence and reporting capabilities. The SBTech offering includes its seamless sportsbook, Chameleon360 iGaming platform, managed services, on-property sportsbook and omni-channel solutions that provide players with constant access to sports and casino products across all online, mobile and retail channels. Supported by unrivaled expertise in trading and risk management, acquisition and CRM, and the highest standards of regulatory compliance, SBTechs partners consistently achieve rapid growth, enhanced brand loyalty and record revenues."*

DraftKings prioritized **OWNING** their own backend technology via this merger with SBTech, making them the first, and only company in this space to own their risk and trading platform. This gives DraftKings a *huge* edge to the rest of the market. It forked up the cash to keep everything in house not only to provide a better customer experience, but also to widen the moat against competitors as new states come onboard. The key here is to clarify that DraftKings and SBTech combined to be the only player in the market with 100% vertical integration and control of their own backend. Jason Robins and the rest of the management team are placing their efforts on having the best technology and the best product and really going all in on owning the U.S. landscape opening up, with as little need for cross-platform interaction as possible.

This acquisition of SBTech was a complete game changer because it allowed them to be independent from paying revenue share to a third-party for betting lines and risk management services.

**Clarification: no other sports betting/fantasy sports/casino company currently has 100% vertical integration on the level that DraftKings has established.** 

# iGaming Boom

This is where the market is missing the mark. Take the time to read over analyst reports, news articles, and interviews and you'll quickly notice 99% of the general market is completely glazing over DraftKing's iGaming sector. This industry has been a CA$H COW in Europe for awhile now, and is only getting started in the United States. Out of the companies that occupy this space, DraftKings is the only one to create one synergistic platform for Fantasy sports/Sportsbook/iGaming. This will be a huge value proposition that will ultimately rocket DraftKings to the top of the gaming market and solidify it as THE gaming powerhouse moving forward. 

*Processing img 7xt9104sk7761...*

Anyone that's watched the run of Skillz and the hype pushing PaySafe, knows how much anticipation there is for iGaming to become the new norm in the world of gambling. DraftKings has emerged as the market leader in each state they've launched in, and continue to gain more and more market share. Once new users get introduced to their platform, the cross-selling opportunity is limitless and creates an extremely sticky customer acquisition cycle. 

Competitors like Penn and MGM are dinosaurs in this space and have been playing catch-up to DraftKings since 2012. The new age of gamblers don't want to drive to a physical casino location or buy a home desktop to gamble. Everything will be mobile and run in real-time. DraftKings has been building an incredible live-sports ecosystem (first to market) and innovates the possibilities of what you can bet on a daily basis. Just download the app for yourself and do some exploring. I believe this is going to boom in the TikTok/millenial crowd as more states start to hop onboard.

Title: Cybersecurity overview / DD (FEYE, FTNT, and more)
**TLDR:** The whole US got hacked, cyber-security will moon (even more). Still not too late to board a rocket if you pick the right one. There is a lot of profit-taking going on after recent run-ups, once that is passed there could be another 10-20+% short-term gain. Even more, if something goes full meme.

This week: FEYE         Look for ATM calls with expiry before the 2/3/21 earnings call.

Further out: FTNT         LEAPs (if you dont know what those are, just mash in something deep OTM for 2022/2023 and run away).

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

Im not even going to start explaining the 2020 Russian hack. If you want to know more: [https://www.vox.com/22187866/usa-cyber-hack-solar-winds-microsoft](https://www.vox.com/22187866/usa-cyber-hack-solar-winds-microsoft)

Great post that actually preceded the FEYE    from u/Chalupuhh: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kgdp82/feye\_and\_other\_cyber\_stonks\_on\_the\_rise\_from/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kgdp82/feye_and_other_cyber_stonks_on_the_rise_from/)

Even before the hack, a lot of these tickers were starting to get significant press: [https://investorplace.com/2020/10/7-cybersecurity-stocks-to-buy-for-the-5g-wave/](https://investorplace.com/2020/10/7-cybersecurity-stocks-to-buy-for-the-5g-wave/)

There are a number of players in the cybersecurity space. Some of them (CRWD, NET) have already achieved demi-meme status and/or had huge run-ups before the hack. This overview is just a limited slice. Depending on how things evolve, I may revisit it and add other tickers (feel free to suggest).

&amp;#x200B;

**Fundamentals**

Not even sure why I included this. No one here cares  and certainly, 2020 doesnt give a damn. If you look at anything, at least digest the P/E and put/call ratios.

[A bunch of shit no one here will look at.](https://preview.redd.it/1wrz49pzet761.png?width=2390&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f23f94821dec8fc28f06137c2cfa9648b7e1faa0)

**Charts**

Charts are all 4h (I have limited trading access during the day; therefore, I can only really trade daily momentum). Bollinger bands, MACD, and RSI are below if youre into that kind of thing.

There is one over-arching pattern for many of these companies  gap up on 12/18, peak on 12/22, sell-off through 12/24. 

I hope you smooth brains stumbled into the run-up on FEYE. FireEye has been trading sideways for years. The mini- trip allowed some people a convenient exit point for profit-taking. The short-term chart (30min) shows the stock bouncing off a support level of around 22.35. Institutional holdings have gone up since 12/18. If it gets up above 23, there could be another decent run-up store (obligatory   ). Prior to almost memeing, volume was low (\~7m) and has increased to around 40m. The put/call ratio remains favorable (\~0.65). Options premiums have continued to go up; however, depending on where you look on the options chain there are bargains. Next ER is expected around 2/3/21, time options intelligently as the already inflated IV can lead to an even bigger crush.

[12\/18: a glorious day of tendies](https://preview.redd.it/7vvrzzn9ft761.png?width=1106&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e872369ebc51211fa2c1ff48a37e5bc670a5898c)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/acu4w2a0ht761.png?width=832&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48584285b81bd7f46c15f552540e067007adf125

CRWD has gapped up twice in Dec, once after the hack and once earlier in the month. This has happened in the middle of a 30% run-up. IV is actually at a historical low (\~60) and options volume remains high. 

https://preview.redd.it/7cjnp5njft761.png?width=1098&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1b85e42140e4546167c76f6c1d1342a49eaa530

PANW jumped in mid-November after an earnings miss (-2.36 on an expected 1.33). Why did jump after a big miss? Because 2020. It had the sector-wide gap up on 12/18 of around 5%, but volume and IV have not gone up significantly since.

https://preview.redd.it/w7bdkpboft761.png?width=1092&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee57bda1f71af09e4175d72d151b93bc9a275a72

FTNT has been rolling up steadily for a couple of months now, having had a 30% run-up. Same 12/18 pop. The difference is that prior to the 10/29 ER, it dropped from 130 to 110 and has been making up ground since then. When you put the last couple of months in that context, it feels like there is more room to go up.

https://preview.redd.it/l7duupiqft761.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c687d01eb0fbb6a00085a3eb76a9e8c58b2e37be

NET (Cloudflare) has a similar feel to CRWD. There was a big jump in Oct (44 to 60) in response to product announcements, but a limited response to the hack.

https://preview.redd.it/k6culzptft761.png?width=1394&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18997f3df0349d8b2bef7c175608580ff436016a

[This is where the wheels fall off on this post.](https://preview.redd.it/2p668r5vft761.png?width=1086&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b9daecabdd2e2c5ad854407248fbe356624a8bf)

**Plays**

FEYE could achieve full meme status. There are still some deals to be had in the options chain if you hunt around. ATM calls for a couple of weeks out are still reasonable, with break-evens that are below the recent peak (25.46). If the drop at the end of the spike was profit-taking, then it could go to a price target of 30 or even .

FTNT feels like a solid long-term play. The fundamentals are good, YoY growth is great but not spectacular, and its trading at a P/E thats low compared with everyone else. Naturally, it will beat earnings in February and immediately drop 20%.

Options for CRWD and NET have a big greed premium attached to them. Cloudflare (NET) still hasnt had the same gap up others have, but its at the end of a big run-up. Theres a decent chance they will both get an earnings beat in February, especially as companies hand out contracts after the hack. Impossible to predict how things will go after that  probably up bigly as people have attached huge P/E ratios to both.

Im still trying to figure out how to play CHKP and MRVL.

***It has become blatantly obvious that most of you are COMPLETELY IGNORANT OF THE PSTH PLAY AND IN SPECIFIC THE WARRANT INCENTIVE YOU ARE NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF.***

**We therefor go to the PSTH S1 since no one on this sub can read or google or do both at the same time:**

As the largest blank check company currently pursuing a business combination, we can offer a larger-capitalization private company (with market capitalization of $10,000,000,000 or more) the opportunity to gain access to the public equity markets, without such company having to conduct its own initial public offering (IPO). Through a merger, we will be, in effect, facilitating the IPO of a large private company, enabling a private business to avoid the inherent costs and risks associated with the traditional IPO process. 

First, our Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants provide our public stockholders with incentives not to redeem their shares of ClassA Common Stock in connection with our initial business combination. We will issue a fixed pool of 44,444,444 Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants; **holders who choose to redeem their shares will lose the right to receive any such warrants.** Public stockholders who choose not to redeem their shares of ClassA Common Stock will share in this fixed pool with other non-redeeming holders (on a pro-rata basis), and will receive the additional warrants that were effectively surrendered by redeeming holders. As a result, public stockholders who do not redeem their shares will receive at least two-ninths of a Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrant per share they hold, and a proportionally greater amount as other holders elect to redeem. We believe this structure will likely lead to a lower level of redemptions, and therefore, we will likely have more funds available for our initial business combination. 

NOW PAY ATTENTION, From the S1:

Securities offered:

200,000,000 units, at $20.00 per unit, each unit consisting of:

one share of ClassA Common Stock;

one-ninth of one Distributable Redeemable Warrant; **and**

**a contingent right to receive Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants**

**What is a** ***contingent right to receive Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants*** **you ask?**

**"By way of example, if no public stockholders elect to redeem their shares of ClassA Common Stock in connection with our initial business combination, for every nine shares of ClassA Common Stock held by a public stockholder and not redeemed, such holder would receive two Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants."**

\------

IT GETS BETTER

**"If half of the shares of ClassA Common Stock issued in this offering are redeemed, for every nine shares of ClassA Common Stock held by a public stockholder and not redeemed, such holder would receive four Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants. The contingent right to receive such warrants will remain attached to the shares of ClassA Common Stock sold in this offering and will not be separately transferable, assignable or salable."**

That is it. Sorry but I have been shocked more than ever before by the ignorance I have witnessed on WSB. Level 5, 6 and 7 accounts commenting dogshit misinformation. 

***MODS MESSAGING ME ASKING ME TO CLARIFY THE WARRANTS. JESUS CHRIST.***

Merry Christmas.

Title: Why SNAP a bullish scenario and will be around 100$ in 18 months
Hello fellow autists, I once thought snapchat was a shitty company that would eventually die out once everyone outgrew the photo sending communicating app. But somehow the stock price has had great momentum and even though I am a user of the app I do not see how it could be a 75 billion dollar company. Then I decided to do my own research and see a company that could certainly be more and no one can do what they can do. 

For boomers who don't know what snapchat is. It is a camera application that helps people to communicate through short videos and images known as a Snap. The Company provides Camera, Friends Page, Discover, Snap Map, Memories and Spectacles. Snapchat opens directly into the Camera, helping in creating a Snap and sending it to friends. It offers a range of creative tools that enables people to personalize and add content to their Snaps. Its chat services includes creating and watching stories, chatting with groups, making voice and video calls, and communicating through a range of stickers and Bitmojis. Memories enable users to create Snaps and stories from their saved snaps, as well as their camera roll. It also offers Spectacles, its sunglasses that make Snap. The Company's advertising products include Snap Ads and Sponsored Creative Tools, such as Sponsored Lenses and Sponsored Geofilters.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[The different screens on the app ](https://preview.redd.it/s2hqqja8ss761.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49ebfd663de32d3995f69127153a251dd22a5257)

Snapchat is the #1 social media company from middle schoolers to millennials. Not everybody has Facebook, Instagram, or twitter. But in the younger age groups snapchat has become almost as common as a phone number and rather then asking for a phone number one may say "Can I have your snap?".  

Snapchat also stands out from other social media companies because it is the best at monetizing its users. Snapchat does not make money from its users, but rather takes its large amount of users and their data and then presents it to companies who wish to advertise. On top of that, snapchat has stayed true to its users and is very receptive of what users have to say, using their feedback to consistently better the app. I have been a user of the app since 2013. 

But going back to the main point of monetization because that's what you gambling addict fuckers love to know, snapchat has over one third of monetization of twitter and over one fifth of monetization of Facebook and Snapchat's growth outpaces them so much that it is not even close. Below is a table of snapchat growth just in the United State alone. Over half of the people from 12 years old to 34 years old have fucking snapchat and growth in users has grown about 5% a year and beats expectations consistently while twitter misses expectations every quarter and gets in trouble because so many users are inactive or fucking bots. But also going off twitter, Snapchat recently came with a deal connected to twitter so tweets can be directly taken from twitter and posted on snapchat. And the more integrated snapchat becomes in our society, the growth of users will only become more exponential. 

&amp;#x200B;

Long Term Bullish Case:

Snap is winning with an "unduplicated and hard-to-reach audience. And while Facebook is getting in trouble for monopolies, snapchat is coming right under our noses with the fact that they provide exposure to multiple, seemingly unstoppable forces: digital ad spending, mobile gaming and entertainment, and overall smartphone addiction which is only expected to grow and do not see any case where growth will be stopped anytime soon, throw in the coronavirus as a catapult that launches this stock to the moon. Around one third of Americans currently have Snapchat, how long till the rest of the world starts to catch up?

Snapchat is entirely different then other social media companies because of how private you can make things. And the experience is a lot more personal which separates it from twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. Which are all basically the same thing and makes Snap is in a different league of its own and has so much room to grow. Even though you missed out on ipo prices, theres no reason to miss out on more potential gains and in the last week there has been a dip of around 4% which is the perfect time to buy the fucking dip and ride the rocket to tendie town. 

Funds are buying it and lots of unusual options activity is evident. 

Someone just bought last trading day $929,726 of fucking 53c 01/15/21 for snap

Title: Digital Banking will be huge for $SE - comparing market opp for them
&amp;#x200B;

SE is has a 98B market cap. 

$SE just got the license to operate as a fully digital bank in Singapore. This is great for a number of reasons (strengthening shoppeepay) and to generating money as a bank. The data insights from one of the biggest online shopping platform giants partnered with banking can bring massive potential to the company.

Amazon only offers a creditcard, that is small compared to operating a fully digital bank. There are so many more products $SE can offer clients (mortgages, LoC, heloc). Singapore is also just the start.

ShopeePay is currently in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines. **It is only a matter of time before $SE is able to launch a digital bank in the other countries.** Looking at the careers pay there are hiring exec level positions for SeaMoney in the Philippines.

it also doesn't just stop there too. Where Shopee has a foothold in other countries such as Brazil. Sea is also working to building out the financial sector there too. Look at this posting for "**Head of Payments - (So Paulo)**"

&amp;#x200B;

SE is valued under 100B compare that to Amazon at over a trillion. There is huge potential for $SE, especially in these growing economies. If anyone has read Ray Dalio rise and fall of empires, it is about rise and fall of countries. Cathie Wood also treats these major FAANGs like cash cause they grow so slow, and she invests in the next set of FAANGs. Look how much she has been adding to her portfolio

TLDR: Invest in $SE (located in tiger economies, strong upside potential, lots of integration between online shopping and finance, cathie wood buys tons of it). Anything under $200/share is a steal for what this company will be worth

Title: DASH vs GRUB
Background: doordash and Grubhub driver in cali

Positions: GRUB 2/19/21 $50 P 3/19/21 $50 P 6/18/21 $50 P

Thesis: CA food delivery law will knock GRUB out of CA market, GRUB will drop as further states enact laws, GRUB development cannot and lacks the will to match DASH or UBER after being bought out

Evidence: r/grubhubdrivers is full on angry drivers from CA because the new app layout took away suggested tips for drivers making order payouts drop from double digits to single. Drivers are pissed and are leaving to DASH because DASH also recently re did their app and now I make almost twice as much per hour! When the orders payout is small the drivers do not rush for these orders and the food ends up coming cold and the customers are upset. GRUB really fucked up and are about to get destroyed in market share and company standing.                             This was [market share ](https://infogram.com/us-food-delivery-marketshare-1hnq41vl7znk43z) before the new law, the rest of their numbers dont look great either, GRUB peaked in 2018 and its only going down from there the stock price is still reflecting 2020 which may be their last profitable year but even this year with restaurants shut down GRUB may go negative

US home prices are disgustingly low, literally free money for buyers. Buy as many properties as you can around Austin, still very cheap. Spread yourself as thin as you can.

Moderna vaccine uses a cocktail of different mRNA vs other vaccines that only use one type to combat the OG strain. I have an extra chromosome so I dunno how it works, but go read Bill Gates' latest LinkedIn article if you want to learn about it. As the strain(s) keep popping up everyone is going to want Moderna's vaccine over others. 

Go buy some calls on Monday.

Title:  Twilio - $TWLO  A Great Opportunity for 2021  Commons or Options, The World is Yours 
**TWLO DD  When Opportunity Knocks You Blow the Door Open** 

No, this isnt about PSTH. Its about my other favorite stock and second biggest holding, Twilio ($TWLO). 

I believe this to be a sleeping giant heading into 2021. Twilio ($TWLO) is a cloud services company that has seen exceptional gains over the course of the last three quarters. 

**Overview** 

Twilio ($TWLO) is a developer of communications software, cloud-based platform, and services. **Twilio is a leading communications platform firm that enables developers to integrate communications capabilities such as messaging, voice, and video into client-facing products, thus helping businesses strengthen customer engagement worldwide.** Its platform consists of the following sectors: engagement cloud, programmable communications cloud, and super network. 

Via TWLO, businesses can integrate real-time communications capabilities into business applications, expanding the number of touchpoints with their customers. Twilios value proposition comes from the building blocks available to developers who can use software to assimilate new customer-facing offerings within their applications. Some simple use cases include automatic text notifications for appointments and two-factor authentication for secure services such as WhatsApp. The Programmable communications cloud software is a set of tools that enables developers to embed voice, messaging, and video capabilities into their applications. The super network is a software layer that allows customers' software to communicate with connected devices globally. 

**In other words, they are involved in sales happening online re: e-commerce and get a chunk of that action.** 

Let the tendies rain down amongst thee [https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tony-montanas-little-friend-story-874414](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tony-montanas-little-friend-story-874414) 

Twilio has done its own research on this and that coronavirus response accelerated digital communication strategies by about six years for businesses. 

The CEO cites this in the Cramer interview and uses the very interesting of NIKE as a digital salesforce using TWLO platforms to reach out to customers. The change in focus can be illustrated by Twilios stock run this year, growing 277% year to date. The shares climbed 1.6% higher Tuesday to new highs, closing at $370.75.

**MORNING STAR REPORT SUMMARY**

 Twilio has elite retention rates within the software industry, with gross retention hovering around 97% and net dollar retention north of 120%. 

 We think this is indicative of the stickiness of the firms platform. 

 The proposed acquisition of Segment ties together Twilios software stack and will increase business reliance on the firm for customer engagement. 

 As Twilio invests more in Solutions APIs, there should be a shift away from lower margin products such as messaging, which should also contribute to increased recurring revenues.

 We view narrow-moat Twilio as having a long growth runway ahead, as the company continues to make strategic organic and inorganic investments to expand its platform. 

**Key Points re the Bull Case** 

Several big-time analysts/names have come out calling for a big bull session for TWLO in 2021 

**Alex Zukin**  hugely respected and respected analyst from RBC ranked TWLO as the top software pick for 2021 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5IXWtG9jQU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5IXWtG9jQU)

**Jim Cramer**, you know him  Hes also come out as a big TWLO bull. [https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1341822886043070469](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1341822886043070469) 

Enough from analysts and Cramer though, there are people in the background that lead these people to post about stocks. The managers at Baron Funds are who I am talking about. Baron Funds is incredibly bullish on TWLO. Chief among their managers is **Alex Umansky**.  

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-fund-soaring-despite-coronavirus-51596060341](https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-fund-soaring-despite-coronavirus-51596060341) 

**Oh, and if you dont know who or what Baron Funds are, look into it. Ron Baron is who laid the groundwork for me becoming bullish on TSLA in Q1.** 

Baron has been in on TSLA since 2013. He has been mocked and laughed at over the years for his huge position. Through the pandemic, he has not sold a single share, and only laments not being able to buy more. Even ARK got out of TSLA to some degree on this bull run. Baron Fund has done DD on TSLA and are projecting, based on numbers, revenue, and management (not hype) another 5-10x gain over the next 5 years. Some Ron Baron Balling on YouTube. 

Basically, DUNKING on the silly TSLA bears: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5QJlTMADGQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5QJlTMADGQ)

Anyways, these are the people placing TWLO in their funds in big numbers now. These are the people who actually make money. Do you like Bill Ackman? I do too. Ron Baron is the quieter guy in the background managing 3X as much as Ackman. Baron Funds Alex Umansky, the architect of the TWLO play is amazing though, hes been on a killing spree basically. Up 60% on the year with his 1.5B portfolio at Baron. He has tripled his investment on TWLO thus far with no intent on selling.

**Plays** 

Commons are a great move, imo 

Options are where some serious money can be made in the next 2 quarters though:

April 2021 $400 calls are selling for around $30 premium 

\*\*\*Jan 2022 $500 calls are selling for around $35 premium\*\*\* 

**Positions** 

100 shares @ $315 (up around 12% for me in the last 3 weeks)

Will dive into 2022 options this week, 5 or 10K worth

Oh, and if you dont know who or what Baron Funds are, look into it. Ron Baron is who laid the groundwork for me becoming bullish on TSLA in Q1. 

Baron has been in on TSLA since 2013. He has been mocked and laughed at over the years for his huge position. Through the pandemic, he has not sold a single share, and only laments not being able to buy more. Even ARK got out of TSLA to some degree on this bull run. Baron Fund has done DD on TSLA and are projecting, based on numbers, revenue, and management (not hype) another 5-10x gain over the next 5 years. 

**Some Ron Baron Balling on YouTube. Basically DUNKING on the silly TSLA bears:**

Anyways, these are the people placing TWLO in their funds in big numbers now. These are the people who actually make money. Do you like Bill Ackman? I do too. Ron Baron is the quieter guy in the background managing 3X as much as Ackman. Baron Funds Alex Umansky, the architect of the TWLO play is amazing though, hes been on a killing spree basically. **Up 60% on the year with his 1.5B portfolio at Baron. He has tripled his investment on TWLO thus far with no intent on selling.**

**Baron Fund is notable for TSLA play but also more recently a big investment in SNOW along with Warren Buffet. They are doing very, very well. Take note.**

**Plays**

Commons are a great move, imo

Options are where some serious money can be made in the next 2 quarters though:

 April 2021 $450 calls are selling for around $12 premium

 April 2021 $400 calls are selling for around $30 premium

 **\*\*\*Jan 2022 $500 calls are selling for around $35 premium\*\*\***

**Positions**

 100 shares @ $315 (up around 12% for me in the last 3 weeks)

 Will dive into 2022 options this week, 5 or 10K worth

**Good Luck to all!**

Title: DD: Why Big Tech will be a bad investment for the next decade
So as you know Big Tech (aka FAAMG -Microsoft, not Netflix) has been some of the most successful stocks in the market for the past decade. Each of them doubled over the course of this period, and are as dominant as ever. However, I would argue that these companies are not going to perform nearly as well in the upcoming decade. Heres why: 

1. Anti trust: Anti trust is looming on big tech and this will create massive uncertainties and risks in these stocks for the next few years to come. Right now, the anti trust law suits against Facebook and google are not being taken too seriously in the market. However, as more progression ramps up and these companies start to realize that politicians on both sides of the aisle are moving against them, anti trust becomes a real threat. 

2. They cannot do big acquisitions: Now you can argue that the anti trust issue is not big of a problem. After all these companies have the best lawyers and yes they might be able to extend out these suits for a very long time. However, the bigger issue is the fact that these companies cannot perform any meaningful acquisitions in the meantime. If Facebook tried to acquire any other big company today, they would automatically be denied or at least be heavily scrutinized by the SEC. Thats true for almost all of these companies. Big acquisitions are going to be tough to come by. 

3. Way more competition: Smaller companies are going to take up market share faster than ever before. You can see this in Chewy and Stitch Fix with Amazon, tiktok or Snapchat with Facebook, Tesla is going to win the autonomous race against googles waymo and apples icar, and so on. 

4. These companies dont have much future innovation left: All of these companies are sitting on billions in cash in a zero interest rate environment as their cash erodes away. What this suggests it that these companies cannot find projects that are worthwhile and that are going to be incredibly meaningful in the future. The only exception would be amazon which is reinvesting back heavily. 

Yes these companies are going to continue to be very dominant in our lives. Yes they will still produce positive returns in your portfolio. However, I dont expect them to be the massive hits that they were in the past 10 years. Growth is slowing down and so will the stock price. If youre looking for capital appreciation, there will be better companies to hold for the next decade then these. Arks Cathie Wood said something similar as well and projected that the next set of FAANGs are gonna be in the genomics space.

Title: Why GME is going to the Moon (Compressed information + Links)
I'm keeping this as short as possible, with as much information as possible. I might go over some points, but this is what I consider most important. Let's go.

&amp;#x200B;

***Some of the facts:***

\- We're at the start of a new console cycle, which historically has always lead to a massive spike in share price. Even with the price surge in the last few months, we're still less than 1/6th of what GME was priced at last console cycle. And it's only just begun.

\- 250% of outstanding share float is shorted [(as of Dec. 14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kkjidv/short_of_float_update_gme_the_short_squeeze_is/) This means that there are more short positions than actually shares outstanding, which would create a problem for the shorters, should there be a catalyst that moves the price upwards, [creating a short squeeze.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp)

\- Ryan Cohen, a 35 year old successful businessman, Billionaire, who self-admittedly only invests in companies he believes buys  a 9,98% stake in GameStop and has since increased it to 12,9%.

\- Ryan Cohen sends the BoD [a letter](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf) where he tells them all how unhappy he is with how things are going and that they should get their shit together. This is done BEFORE he increases his stake to 12,9%

\- GameStop has its Q3 earnings which aren't great, but not as bad as projected, their online sales are up over 250% YTY and they have an additional $300 million in their cash reserve ($600 million for a company who's market cap currently is just over $1 Billion). [Link to Q3 Transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/12/09/gamestop-gme-q3-2020-earnings-call-transcript/)

\- We learn that they're closing 1000 stores which are hurting their profit by Q1 of 2021 and are doing some rebranding work. [Stores Shutdown](https://bestlifeonline.com/gamestop-closing/) and [Rebranding](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k66w5h/gme_rebranding_in_progress_theyve_just_changed/)

\- RC Ventures files another 13D on December 22 where he discloses how he increased his stake above 10% to 12,9% with another message for the board ***"While the reporting persons desire to come to an amicable resolution with the issuer, the reporting persons will not hesitate to take any actions that they believe are necessary to protect the best interests of all stockholders."*** [Link to 13D](https://fintel.io/doc/sec/1822844/000119380520001571/e620151_sc13da-gamestop.htm)

\- Investing research group Hedgeye pitches long-term potential for [GME with price target of "$50+".](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kiv44e/gme_target_50/)

&amp;#x200B;

Now most of you should get a good idea why GME is a good bet short-term if you've read the above DD and do some logical thinking. There is also an argument to be made about the future potential it has, if Cohen does indeed turn the ship around and polish this into something magnificent. 

But you need some vision to see that, and I'm not trying to push you retards too much out of your comfort zone.

Title: Bed Bath and Beyond: Bullish or Bearish?
Time for some good old retail. Bed Bath and Beyond reports earnings before the market opens on Thursday, 1/7. It's a heavily shorted stock (more than 50% of the float is shorted, I believe). 

As most of you guys already know, Bed Bath stock hasn't fared too well these past few years. It's been run down by competition and the like, poor decisions, bad earnings and sales, and it's down roughly 60% 5YTD. 

CEO Mark Tritton has stepped in and is transforming the company. And yes, he is indeed transforming Bed Bath dramatically. Completely changing the management, selling off non-core subsidiaries like Cost Plus World Market and Christmas Tree Holdings, and buying back stock. And I mean MASSIVE buybacks. The company is slated to buy back nearly 20% of outstanding shares by 2023, so close to 1 billion dollars of shares.

The landscape for home goods retailers and retail in general is changing - and so is the e-commerce front. So Bed Bath and Beyond has stepped up its game in the digital space, as well as using warehouses to fulfill digital orders. Pivots were made extremely fast, and these may be crucial to Bed Bath's future success. Guidance is currently set at flat growth for FY21 but I think if management raises guidance to high single digit growth and blows estimates out of the park this quarter, we could see a huge short squeeze upwards. 

Thoughts?

Title: $YUM KFConsole is literally going to print tendies from tendies.
Gamers are sick and tired of only 4 console options to game on, being nintendo, sony, microsoft, and pc. Kentucky Fried Chicken is confident in releasing this console, and I do not believe they would have if they didn't believe they could give us tendies. It has a tendie warmer built in, if that tells you anything. Release will likely be late summer/early fall, and the hype on this puppy will be crazy.

And no, I'm not joking. Sounds insane but I'm confident it'll print. Looks like it's in a dip right now.

Title: The Importance of Ambiguity in the Meme Market
We have been in the meme market for a while now, and a big aspect of the big winners has been **ambiguity**. 


It's easy to visualize what Carnival Cruise does. They sell vacations on boats. The opposite is true for Palantir - they sift through data to enable their clients to operate as efficiently as possible. Whereas Carnival is limited to the high seas and island excursions, Palantir promises (and has shown) improvements in a variety of industries, whether it is helping police departments catch criminals or aiding Ferrari's racing efforts. 


In short, if we were to visualize various industries as a geographical map where companies covered their respective interests, the borders for a cruise company would be clear, whereas Palantir's borders would be fuzzy.


These fuzzy lines easily allow for more hype to be drum up. There have been dozens of articles over the past months about various contracts PLTR has acquired, from vaccine distribution to military operations, keeping them in the news and our short attention spans focused on them.  


This is why Tesla has excelled. Musk is constantly promoting different industries Tesla can expand to, even if it is unclear how they will get there. Not only does he reference sub-groups in the auto industry, but he links Tesla to other ambitious projects, from the battery industry to public transportation.


Not to mention, if we are in a bubble, then it would make sense people would invest in companies whose market potential is hard to define. You can't say a stock has hit it's ceiling if you can't define the ceiling in the first place.


Usually uncertainty is bad news in the stock market, but now it is embraced as potential. Personally, I am going to accept our new meme overlords by investing in ARKK and ARKG. Innovation should continue to rise as the meme markets thrive, and the Genetic Revolution is a potential trillion dollar industry once unlocked. Think of genetics as a desert sun transported over a frozen tundra - in the dawn slowly showing it's head over the snow capped mountains, soon to thaw our new lives as midday finally comes. 


I know I am largely stating the obvious, but sometimes it is important for the obvious to be said. Thank you for reading and have a Happy New Years!

Title: PSTH ROCKET SHIP and PAPA ACKMAN take me to TENDIE TOWN
# About

Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, Ltd. (PSTH), a Delaware corporation, is a newly organized blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with a private company. PSTHs sponsor is 100% owned by the Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P. (PSCM) funds.

PSTH has not yet selected any specific business combination target. PSTH intends to pursue merger opportunities with private, large capitalization, high-quality, growth companies.

PSTH will seek targets in four principal market segments: high-quality IPO candidates, mature unicorns, private equity portfolio companies, and family-owned companies.

# SharkBoy Kevins Thoughts

Among the SPACs that OLeary has bought are ones from Bill Ackman, Michael Klein and Alec Gores.I only buy the deals where I know the sponsor has been a player successfully in private equity. 

If youre going to buy a SPAC, make sure your horse and your jockey are proven winners.

As of late, mergers have failed with Stripe, Robinhood and Coinbase. Most recent rumor floating around is a merger partnership with Bloomberg.

Title: Proof that GME will have a Q4 earnings blow out! 
I was doing some DD on Game Stop and came across this video! Not sure if we need anymore hype on GameStop, but I expect that when the short sellers see this, they will be shaking in their boots. Not only does this video show a huge infusion of cash for GameStop, but you can see that there were actually other paying customers in the store (also buying stuff). All of that stuff is great, but my big take away is that this video has gotten over 36 million views in under 2 weeks. This is essentially millions of dollars of free advertising for GameStop.

Pretty big news if you ask me!

Title: Flywheel of Basic Btches DD on $STIC aka BarkBox, $370k position in shares
**Part 1 - Flywheel of Basic Bitches**

The root of why Amazon is so successful, is because they follow this flywheel of growth:

*Processing img 5mdyreqd2m761...*

As it turns out, BarkBox has an even better wheel, the growth wheel of basic bitches, check out this video where I looked up their #barkbox hashtag on Instagram. There is a new public post with the #BarkBox tag EVERY SINGLE MINUTE:

*Processing video ljf205se2m761...*

And this is only PUBLIC posts, where most Instagram posts are private. This explains how they grew to 1 million users so quickly. For you retards, let me draw this flywheel for you:

*Processing img agsz39sr2m761...*

To be clear, my investment thesis here is not that this company is not valued properly compared to the likes of CHWY. In fact:

* Chewy has an annual revenue of 7 Billion, BarkBox has estimated annual revenue of 370 Million, which is roughly 19x smaller than Chewy's. 
* Chewy has a market cap of 43 Billion, BarkBox's is \~2.9 Billion as of Friday's closing price, which is roughly 15x smaller than Chewys. 

So you can see BarkBox is valued slightly higher actually. However, what we have is BarkBox's growth rate based on the BB flywheel, I can see them hitting 2 million subscribers, 4 million subscribers in the upcoming years. 

**Part 2 - Basic Bitches on RobinHood**

&amp;#x200B;

1. People love spoiling their dogs, the few basic bitches I know that own BarkBox, look forward to it every month. Don't you friggin love giving a good gift? They have immense positive emotions attached to BarkBox.
2. In 2020, almost every basic bitch has gotten Robinhood or Cash app this year and are trading stocks.
3. What do you think will happen once they find out they can actually buy their favorite $BARK stock?? Just look at the becky stocks. Right now they don't know about $STIC, I think once word gets out, they will jump on.  
 

**My Position**

I basically invest in what's called the[u/SIR\_JACK\_A\_LOT](https://www.reddit.com/u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT/)ETF. I don't understand why some of y'all are giving him shit when all his picks have only gone up, and you couldve gotten in the day he posted for less than his entering cost!

*Processing img urmuveii2m761...*

Anyhow, I know I'm lucky in getting in before the 25% run up. But I truly believe the reason it ran up so fast is because no one is selling, they realize what a strong potential $STIC has. I plan on holding both GME and STIC until they moon at least 3x.

Title: Momentus
Basically, I made a post about S R A C about a month ago when the stonk was trading around 13. Its gone up to around 19 since then and I still believe theres room for at least 30. 

Momentus is a space logistics company that will be merging with S R A C in 2021. As of now, they are only one of a few publicly traded pure space plays. They will be part of a ride share with spaceX on Jan 14 launch. During that launch, momentus will house small satellites within their vehicle and take them to their desired orbits once spaceX drops them off in LEO. Low earth orbit. Value prop is giving smaller satellite customers that dont command drop off priority from spaceX a better orbit. Momentus is working on larger vehicles that can take larger sats to orbits other than LEO and perform other functions like moon mining and shit. 

Upon completion of IPO, Chris Hadfield will join their board. As Ive said before, biggest issue is the CEOs visa status. Since he is Russian, US law prevents him from accessing his own tech. I believe the issue will be resolved largely due to the amount of contracts and partnerships they have been landing as of lately. I truly believe this will run more leading up to Jan 14 launch. IMO the launch will determine if this pulls a SPCE or keeps mooning. 

Positions: Long 5k shares and 10 5/21 7.5c

Title: GME is done rising no more FOMO, but you can still ride it back down for massive $$$$
As much as people want to deny it, or the circumstances around the recent squeeze, GS is still in a rut, still closing stores, still has declining customers due to lack of locations and shoddy customer service, less deals with partners, and all that means less revenue and less profits. They also have certain items they overloaded on that they need to clearance out that just sit in their stores that no one buys, also draining resources.

The time for this rocket launch for GME is over, because there are no actual fundamentals that show a bright future or any sort of turn around, there isn't enough to prop this stock up either, it will soon come crashing down once the decline starts and people run with their bags and escape.

With no TA or fundamentals or even a solid foundation under GS it can't move up much more than it already has and the only direction it will go in is DOWN.

&amp;#x200B;

[\(Blue line is where GME is now, Orange line is the support, which is much lower and diving, The orange bars starting to become higher than the blue bars on the bottom, represent the falling support overtaking gains. GET OUT NOW! Or buy puts.\)](https://preview.redd.it/zw0ap5vtcl761.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7edd88fae44aa485d09b83be6350d00f1926c8e2)

***However, this is an opportunity*** Look at how much some people made holding those GME bags for this artificial launch? You can make near the same amount, though not exactly, by riding GME back down. So you still have a chance if you missed out on the rise to cash in on the fall. whether shares or options.

I know a lot of people re uh, attached to GME after recent events and will dislike this, but recent WSB history and even longer WSB has shown it is foolish to keep fomoing on the stock after it's had multiple boosts, be smart it's not going to move up without any sort of massive spectacular news that will cause people to believe GME is on the rebound and that's not happening, at least not soon, and until then it will fall. Of course pointing out reality will piss off those waiting for the next jump while holding the bag and they'll put out fake hope so you can be fooled and help them get out while the downvote everyone else.

***But simple DD will show you*** that it's time to prepare for GME to fall. Outside an earth shattering event it has nothing to move it to $25-$30, in fact it was already starting to move downward at last close, don't be left holding calls or shares that are worthless, aim to cash in on the dive at open on Monday.

Title: Flywheel of Basic Btches DD on $STIC aka BarkBox, my position is $370k of shares
# Part 1 - Flywheel of Basic Bitches

The reason why Amazon is so successful is because they follow this flywheel of growth:

![img](p4d9dyih1l761)

Well, BarkBox is even better as I discovered they follow the holy growth wheel of basic bitches, check out this video where I looked up their #barkbox hashtag on Instagram. There is a new public post with the #BarkBox tag EVERY SINGLE MINUTE:

![video](wnsg9b7i1l761)

&amp;#x200B;

And this is only PUBLIC posts, most Instagram posts are private. This explains how they grew to 1 million users so quickly. For you retards, let me draw this flywheel for you:

![img](tj0g7udj1l761)

&amp;#x200B;

So to be clear, my investment thesis here is not that this company is not valued properly compared to the likes of CHWY or anything. In fact, Chewy has annual revenue of 7 Billion,  BarkBox has estimated annual revenue of 370 Million, which is roughly 19x smaller than Chewy's. Chewy has a market cap of 43 Billion, BarkBox's is \~2.9 Billion as of Friday's closing price, which is roughly 15x smaller than Chewys. So you can see BarkBox is valued slightly higher actually.

However, what we have is BarkBox's growth rate based on the flywheel, I can see them hitting 2 million subscribers, 4 million subscribers in the upcoming years.

&amp;#x200B;

# Part 2 - Basic Bitches on RobinHood

1. People love spoiling their dogs, the few basic bitches I know that own BarkBox, look forward to it every month. Don't you friggin love giving a good gift? They have immense positive emotions attached to BarkBox.
2. Almost every basic bitch has gotten Robinhood or Cash app this year and are trading stocks.
3. What do you think will happen once they find out they can actually buy their favorite $BARK stock?? Just look at the Becky stocks. Right now they don't know about $STIC, I think once word gets out, there will be frenzy buying.

# My Position

I basically invest in what's called the u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT ETF. I don't understand why some of y'all are giving him shit when all his picks have only gone up.

Yes I got lucky and got in just in time for the 25% run up (you would have too if you just bought after Sir Jack's DD post. But this is just the beginning. I plan on holding both GME and STIC until they moon at least 3x.

Title: GME ICR Conference - Words Matter
GME Gang, a belated Merry Christmas  . Our savior, u/DeepFuckingValue, has shown us the light, and we must rejoice for him and his. Watch this ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIVscxs9oJg&amp;t=11s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIVscxs9oJg&amp;t=11s)) if you aren't familiar with the duality that is Roaring Kitty &amp; DFV. Smash that subscribe button and come back to reading (or ask a grown-up for help) these words.

As the semiliterate among you know, GameStop was scheduled to present on the last day of the ICR Conference (an investor conference for public &amp; private companies to show off how big their shlong is going to be when fully pumped) on January 13th, under the retail category. GameStop analyst extraordinaire (I won't speaketh the naughty Eeking Salpha words, mods) Justin Doperiala at DOMO Capital caught this minor, yet massive tweak.

At some point in the last few days, GameStop was shifted from the Retail &amp; Consumer category on the 13th to now present under the TECHNOLOGY category AH on Jan 11th. What does this mean? Management may not be-a-buncha-bitches after all. They clearly requested the category switch and have something TECHNOLOGY related to share. M&amp;A? Strategic shift/review? DIGITAL FIRST OMNI-CHANNEL?!? 

Now, #WeWantCohen and there's really nothing the boomers can say to change that. But what they can do, is speak boomerish in a way that the other market participants are made aware of the tech &amp; e-commerce opportunity that has not been valued in any way by the market (yes, even at $20/share the stock is an easy 2-3x on fundamentals over 2021-2022). GameStop's tens of millions of unique customer profiles and decades deep dataset are truly unique in the massive gaming industry.

Melvin's put position was rolled to Jan21 (see pic), and management surely knows this. Could they be competent after all? Yes. This tells us they are dropping dongs. Now will Melvin bend over and take it? Doubtful. But don't believe the FUD. The upside opportunity and near term re-rating has been enhanced by Management's choice of the words TECHNOLOGY in this case.

TL;DR: DFV is the man. GME is going much higher. I have thousands of shares and hundreds of ITM/ATM/OTM calls from Apr21 to Jan2023.

P.S. 

Title: Goodbye GME - HELLO GPRO - RIDE THIS B to $20!!!
# Goodbye GME - HELLO GPRO or RIDE THIS B to $20!!!

# TLDR: Gopro is now a software company with a product.  700k subscribers EOY. 2million EOY 2021 projection -  thats $100 million of annual recurring revenue going into 22, before they even add any new subscribers and thats at least 50% operating profit for the business. 

85% of whats being bought on gopro.com comes from the subscription. Users get a $50 discount when they buy the camera with the subscription. Current subscription cost is $4.99/month. Users get unlimited cloud storage, total camera replacement and up to 50% off at GoPro.com

Were going to launch a new updated version of the GoPro app. And it became clear to us that we should make the GoPro app available to people that dont even own a GoPro and serve them through the app. Its through software. And its a terrific opportunity for us to address a much larger TAM when you consider the number of people using smartphones compared to using GoPros.

# BUY FING NOW. TAKE THIS B to $20 and beyond.

GoPro Says Subscriber Count Has Passed 670K; Expects To End Year With Over 700

"GoPro.com performed as we expected, handily breaking sales records over the Black Friday  Cyber Monday period, thus ensuring we'll finish the year with well over 700,000 subscribers," said Nicholas Woodman, GoPro's founder and CEO. "We are confident about our ability to exit 2020 with low channel inventory and a promising outlook for 2021."

12/1 - GoPro, Inc. (GPRO) Management Presents at Wells Fargo 2020 Virtual TMT Summit Conference

And the net result is higher margin, lower operating costs, better inventory management, better cash management, cash generation, and ultimately, a more profitable GoPro.

But I can speak for GoPros and we got comfortable with a shift to being more direct-to-consumer because we had good data as to consumers' propensity to buy directly from gopro.com. Weve been growing our direct business year-over-year for quite some time.

And weve also made a fundamental shift in the value proposition at gopro.com. Its not just, hey, HERO8 Black or flagship is available here. Its also \[Technical Difficulty\] and if you are a GoPro subscriber, you can get it for $299 instead of $349; I am sorry, $449. So if you want to become a subscriber right now to get that deal, its $50 bucks. So your total basket price is $349 and you saved $100 over the $449 purchase price.

And were only going to offer more value to consumers over time through the GoPro subscription to help make it even more attractive, improve retention even further. Its already really good. Were really happy with it, but thats something were going to continue to build upon. And so direct-to-consumer is an ongoing key initiative for GoPro as our subscription business. They go hand in hand.

We have about 85% of whats being bought on gopro.com, whether its HERO9 or HERO8, 85% comes with the subscription, which is very high and we see very high retention rate particularly on annual. So it gives us some really good data and information plus the value proposition were offering that pushes us into 2021.

On our earnings call, we also talked about trying to reach up to 2 million subscribers in 2021. And given the growth in direct-to-consumer and the attach rate, we feel good about that number. And just to put it in perspective, at 2 million subscribers exiting 21, thats $100 million of annual recurring revenue going into 22, before we even add any new subscribers. And to put it in financial perspective, thats at least 50% operating profit for the business

And cash generation from this model has improved dramatically. You saw that in Q3, where we generated nearly $100 million of operating cash flow and we forecasted $225 million of cash in addition. So thats another $80 million or so free cash flow and Q4 notwithstanding to convert, so the convert would be on top of that. So I think this model puts us in a really good position from an operating model and cash perspective, as we head into 21.

Were going to launch a new updated version of the GoPro app. And it became clear to us that we should make the GoPro app available to people that dont even own a GoPro and serve them through the app. Its through software. And its a terrific opportunity for us to address a much larger TAM when you consider the number of people using smartphones compared to using GoPros.

Thanks for reading!

Title: Cineplex (CGX)  DD  The Movie Theatre Play You Have Not Been Paying Attention To 
**Cineplex ($CGX)  DD - LIGHTS, CAMERA, MOON ** 

**The Company Cineplex**

(CGX) is a Canadian  movie theatre operations company. Actually, its really the only series movie company in Canada, a North American country with 35 million people. Outside of movie theatre operations, CGX is involved in digital commerce and online e-sports platforms for competitive gamers. CGX was originally founded in 1912, headquartered in Toronto and essentially has a monopoly on the movie industry in Canada. 

**The company has three business segments:** 

Film Entertainment and Content (including a fast growing and innovative streaming service that out-competes any of the American movie companies). 

Media and Amusement 

Leisure 

**TLDR (sort of)** 

Cineplex (CGX) is Canadas movie theatre company. With 164 locations across the country and 10 million accounts through its Scotiabank supporter SCENE program (there are only 35 million people in Canada), this really is Canadas movie theatre. It has next to no competition in Canada and its stock has suffered incredibly during COViD and is wildly undervalued. 

The companys financials are sound, and it has completed several deals including arrangements with Scotiabank (Canadas largest bank) in relation to its customer loyalty program as well as Universal in USA to ensure Hollywood pipeline for new releases and its streaming service (one of the best in the USA/Canada) is successful. Both deals happened just in the fall. 

**Humans are social animals and will return in large numbers to the majestic experience of the movie theatre. This play has both short term and long-term upside  the upside in both cases is enormous. While risks exist here as with any deal, they are reasonable.** 

A simple, predictable, cash flow positive company that is wildly undervalued and about to pop on stimulus news (back to fair value) and even more in Q1-Q2 on re-opening and widespread vaccination. 

Given the pent-up demand for social activities like this, the pent-up production supply in Hollywood, and the fact that many are sleeping on this play, a big swing anytime in the next couple of months is possible, making options attractive.

Short term price target = $15 (+65% from current levels)

In the medium term = $30 (+230% from current levels) 

**Background Info on the Play** 

Pre-COVID the stock was trading at around $35, doing very well for itself and had secured a deal for takeover with Cineworld (big UK company). When COVID hit, CGX, like all money theatres clearly took a hit. CGX took another hit in that Cineworld abandoned the deal in light of the pandemic. 

Since this time, the company has made several important decisions in dealing with COVID and planning for the future:

**Quick on their feet in response to COVID** 

They were responsible during the lockdown in the spring as well as into the summer when they re-opened their doors to millions of movie-goers. 

They quickly implemented new COViD-friendly practices and discounting for patrons. o They brought back a ton of old movie names like Jaws, Tarantino movies, etc.

Private Venues - CGX began promotional offers for block bookings to use up the theatres, they were not screening movies in. For $120, 20 people could book a private party and choose from more than 1,000 movies to screen. These moves are anticipated to continue once the second wave of lockdowns lifts in early 2021. 

Sale of their Headquarters to ensure further liquidity and the payment of debt Negative Tailwinds leading to the undervalued stock price 

**1. COVID  Enough Said** 

**2. Cineworld** 

In 2020, after covid hit, Regal owner Cineworld Group (UK) withdrew its planned $2.1 billion takeover of CGX. The deal would have led to one of the world's largest cinema companies with more than 11,200 screens globally. The Cineworld pullout has impacted the stock as well and again we think its dropped too much even considering that failure. In July, CGX sued Cineworld for leaving the deal. Well see what happens. 

**Specific Important Moves CGX has completed:** 

**Scotiabank Deal (Scotiabank is the nations biggest bank)  December 2020 Deal** 

On December 18th, CGX announced that they have entered into an agreement to enhance and expand the SCENE loyalty program by bringing together the full benefits of SCENE with Scotia Rewards, Scotiabank's flexible customer loyalty program. In addition to providing SCENE's over 10 million members with the opportunity to redeem points for a variety of entertainment and dining options, beginning in the fall of 2021 members can look forward to redemption opportunities for a wide selection of brand-name merchandise from popular retailers. Members will also have the opportunity to apply points as statement credits on certain Scotiabank products, as well as book flexible travel. 

**Online Streaming Platform Deal with Universal  November 2020 Deal** 

Cineplex is also well positioned in terms of long-term investments it made in the online streaming sector. CGX, as a theatre operations business in Canada is better positioned then any of the American theatre companies, who have been slower to adapt to COViD (and in many cases did not have this streaming infrastructure in place prior to COVID as CGX did). CGX and Universal Filmed Entertainment Group announced a multi-year agreement for theatrical exclusivity windows in the Canadian market. This new dynamic window agreement between the two companies preserves the theatrical experience, while adapting to changing consumer behaviour, particularly as the world and the entertainment industry navigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

\*Similar to the agreements that Universal has established with other major exhibitors, coming into effect immediately, the agreement guarantees at least three full weekends (17 days) of theatrical exclusivity for all Universal Pictures and Focus Features theatrical releases, at which point the studio will have the option to make its titles available across premium video on demand (PVOD) platforms, including the Cineplex Store. Under the terms of the deal, any title that has a North American opening weekend box office of $50 million or more, including franchise titles, will play exclusively in theatres for at least five full weekends (31 days) before the title can be made available on PVOD. 

**Financials** 

On review of the companies 2020 Q3 financial report and on review of the balance sheet, CGX is not poorly position considering its sector, the pandemic, and the monopoly it holds in Canada. The current ratio (ratio measuring assets to liabilities) for the company is around 0.45-.50. For reference, JPMs is 0.88. Textbooks report 2.0 or higher as a strong ratio. Movies and banks are different entities for sure. But context matters. 

As of Q3 2020, Cineplex had US$350 million in outstanding debt on its balance sheet and a monthly cash burn rate at around US$15 million to remain in operation. The company has a lot of property to lay with if need be. It will utilize the federal refund as well as rent forgiveness programs during COVID to manager operating expenses. 

**Bull Case for the Future** 

Ultimately, we all know that several sectors have been hardest hit by this pandemic. 

Many will not be a priority for government support or bailout. While this is sad for the economy, it also represents an incredible buying opportunity for those with some tolerance for volatility. Based on the analysis here, CGX is trading at an incredibly high discount when you take into account the balance sheet and a reasonable look to the future. One thing to keep in mind here is the difference between the american and canadian perspective on funding. 

As mentioned elsewhere in the DD, CGX has the ability to receive government money and incentives. The Canadian gov is super liberal and would never let this flag ship die. 

**A few key points and some speculation to consider:** 

The pandemic will come to a close. Companies as big as CGX who have not become insolvent thus far, will soldier on through the winter if their management makes the right moves. CGX has an exceptional management team. 

The in-person movie theatre experience is going to come back in a momentous way. Humans are social animals and there are few activities as gratifying to us as going to the movies with friends and family and loved ones. We make cherish memories with this sort of activity, its fun and it has an intrinsic value and purpose in our society. 

There is pent up demand for spending of all kinds. This isnt limited to people going to the mall. They will flock to the theatres when this is all over as well. The mall and theatre stocks will be the last to bounce on the end of the pandemic news. Even more than airlines (because the GOV knows it cant let them die).

Pent up demand for traditional consumerism is matched by the pent-up supply Hollywood has to offer. While production has slowed down in tangible ways, screenwriting etc, has not. How many scripts and plans were made during covid? The floodgates here are going to open. COVID 19 as a sub-genre in film is something that we will come to appreciate in the years to come. 

As the big player in Canada, CGX will be in a position to buy out any of the remaining small movie companies in Canada as we emerge from COVID and its financials improve. 

**Price Targets** 

This is highly speculative. The company trades at $9 presently. Pre-pandemic is traded at around $35. Its % in terms of asset/liability does not justify this stock price. Its fair value is somewhere in the mid to high teens right now, all things considered. It traded at around $15 for the majority of the pandemic, which reflects this well. 

As hysteria lessons and as theatres re-open this stock is set to move a lot. It has been hit very hard by the pandemic, the closing and failings of huge American theatre companies and the controversy over the Cineworld deal.

Short term price target in the next few months will likely mimic where it was during the lockdowns at $15 (+65% from current levels).

In the medium term as things get back to normal heading into Q3-Q4 of 2021 and into 2022 this stock is positioned to move back to $30 (+230% from current levels)

Pre-COVID the stock was trading at around $35, doing very well for itself and had secured a deal for takeover with Cineworld (big UK company). When COVID hit, CGX, like all money theatres clearly took a hit. CGX took another hit in that Cineworld abandoned the deal in light of the pandemic.

**Since this time, the company has made several important decisions in dealing with COVID and planning for the future:**

 **Quick on their feet in response to COVID**

o They were responsible during the lockdown in the spring as well as into the summer when they re-opened their doors to millions of movie-goers.

o They quickly implemented new COViD-friendly practices and discounting for patrons.

o They brought back a ton of old movie names like Jaws, Tarantino movies, etc.

o **Private Venues -** CGX began promotional offers for block bookings to use up the theatres, they were not screening movies in. For $120, 20 people could book a private party and choose from more than 1,000 movies to screen. These moves are anticipated to continue once the second wave of lockdowns lifts in early 2021.

o Sale of their Headquarters to ensure further liquidity and the payment of debt

**Negative Tailwinds leading to the undervalued stock price**

**1.** **COVID  Enough Said**

**2.** **Cineworld**

In 2020, after covid hit, Regal owner Cineworld Group (UK) withdrew its planned $2.1 billion takeover of CGX. The deal would have led to one of the world's largest cinema companies with more than 11,200 screens globally.

The Cineworld pullout has impacted the stock as well and again we think its dropped too much even considering that failure.

In July, CGX sued Cineworld for leaving the deal. Well see what happens.

**------------------------------------------------------**

**Specific Important Moves CGX has completed:**

**Scotiabank Deal (Scotiabank is the nations biggest bank)  December 2020 Deal**

On December 18th, CGX announced that they have entered into an agreement to enhance and expand the SCENE loyalty program by bringing together the full benefits of SCENE with Scotia Rewards, Scotiabank's flexible customer loyalty program. In addition to providing SCENE's over 10 million members with the opportunity to redeem points for a variety of entertainment and dining options, beginning in the fall of 2021 members can look forward to redemption opportunities for a wide selection of brand-name merchandise from popular retailers. Members will also have the opportunity to apply points as statement credits on certain Scotiabank products, as well as book flexible travel.

**Online Streaming Platform Deal with Universal  November 2020 Deal**

Cineplex is also well positioned in terms of long-term investments it made in the online streaming sector. CGX, as a theatre operations business in Canada is better positioned then any of the American theatre companies, who have been slower to adapt to COViD (and in many cases did not have this streaming infrastructure in place prior to COVID as CGX did).

CGX and Universal Filmed Entertainment Group announced a multi-year agreement for theatrical exclusivity windows in the Canadian market. This new dynamic window agreement between the two companies preserves the theatrical experience, while adapting to changing consumer behaviour, particularly as the world and the entertainment industry navigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

**\*\*Similar to the agreements that Universal has established with other major exhibitors, coming into effect immediately, the agreement guarantees at least three full weekends (17 days) of theatrical exclusivity for all Universal Pictures and Focus Features theatrical releases, at which point the studio will have the option to make its titles available across premium video on demand (PVOD) platforms, including the Cineplex Store. Under the terms of the deal, any title that has a North American opening weekend box office of $50 million or more, including franchise titles, will play exclusively in theatres for at least five full weekends (31 days) before the title can be made available on PVOD.**

**---------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Financials**

On review of the companies 2020 Q3 financial report and on review of the balance sheet, CGX is not poorly position considering its sector, the pandemic, and the monopoly it holds in Canada.

The current ratio (ratio measuring assets to liabilities) for the company is around 0.45-.50. For reference, JPMs is 0.88. Textbooks report 2.0 or higher as a strong ratio. Movies and banks are different entities for sure. But context matters.

As of Q3 2020, Cineplex had US$350 million in outstanding debt on its balance sheet and a monthly cash burn rate at around US$15 million to remain in operation.

The company has a lot of property to lay with if need be. It will utilize the federal refund as well as rent forgiveness programs during COVID to manager operating expenses.

**Bull Case for the Future**

Ultimately, we all know that several sectors have been hardest hit by this pandemic. Many will not be a priority for government support or bailout. While this is sad for the economy, it also represents an incredible buying opportunity for those with some tolerance for volatility. Based on the analysis here, CGX is trading at an incredibly high discount when you take into account the balance sheet and a reasonable look to the future.

One thing to keep in mind here is the difference between the american and canadian perspective on funding. As mentioned elsewhere in the DD, CGX has the ability to receive government money and incentives. The Canadian gov is super liberal and would never let this flag ship die.

**A few key points and some speculation to consider:**

1. The pandemic will come to a close. Companies as big as CGX who have not become insolvent thus far, will soldier on through the winter if their management makes the right moves. CGX has an exceptional management team.

2. The in-person movie theatre experience is going to come back in a momentous way. Humans are social animals and there are few activities as gratifying to us as going to the movies with friends and family and loved ones. We make cherish memories with this sort of activity, its fun and it has an intrinsic value and purpose in our society.

3. There is pent up demand for spending of all kinds. This isnt limited to people going to the mall. They will flock to the theatres when this is all over as well. The mall and theatre stocks will be the last to bounce on the end of the pandemic news. Even more than airlines (because the GOV knows it cant let them die).

4. Pent up demand for traditional consumerism is matched by the pent-up supply Hollywood has to offer. While production has slowed down in tangible ways, screenwriting etc, has not. How many scripts and plans were made during covid? The floodgates here are going to open. COVID 19 as a sub-genre in film is something that we will come to appreciate in the years to come.

5. As the big player in Canada, CGX will be in a position to buy out any of the remaining small movie companies in Canada as we emerge from COVID and its financials improve.

**Price Targets**

This is highly speculative. The company trades at $9 presently. Pre-pandemic is traded at around $35. Its % in terms of asset/liability does not justify this stock price. Its fair value is somewhere in the mid to high teens right now, all things considered. It traded at around $15 for the majority of the pandemic, which reflects this well. As hysteria lessons and as theatres re-open this stock is set to move a lot. It has been hit very hard by the pandemic, the closing and failings of huge American theatre companies and the controversy over the Cineworld deal.

 Short term price target in the next few months will likely mimic where it was during the lockdowns at $15 (+65% from current levels)

 In the medium term as things get back to normal heading into Q3-Q4 of 2021 and into 2022 this stock is positioned to move back to $30 (+230% from current levels)

Title: Cineplex (CGX)  DD  The Movie Theatre Play You Have Not Been Paying Attention To 
**Cineplex ($CGX)  DD - LIGHTS, CAMERA, MOON **

**The Company** 

Cineplex (CGX) is a Canadian ****  movie theatre operations company. Actually, its really the only series movie company in Canada, a North American country with 35 million people. Outside of movie theatre operations, CGX is involved in digital commerce and online e-sports platforms for competitive gamers. CGX was originally founded in 1912, headquartered in Toronto and essentially has a monopoly on the movie industry in Canada.

**The company has three business segments:** 

1. Film Entertainment and Content (including a fast growing and innovative streaming service that out-competes any of the American movie companies).

2. Media and Amusement

3. Leisure

**TLDR (sort of)**

Cineplex (CGX) is Canadas movie theatre company. With 164 locations across the country and 10 million accounts through its Scotiabank supporter SCENE program (there are only 35 million people in Canada), this really is Canadas movie theatre. It has next to no competition in Canada and its stock has suffered incredibly during COViD and is wildly undervalued. The companys financials are sound, and it has completed several deals including arrangements with Scotiabank (Canadas largest bank) in relation to its customer loyalty program as well as Universal in USA to ensure Hollywood pipeline for new releases and its streaming service (one of the best in the USA/Canada) is successful. Both deals happened just in the fall. 

**Humans are social animals and will return in large numbers to the majestic experience of the movie theatre. This play has both short term and long-term upside  the upside in both cases is enormous. While risks exist here as with any deal, they are reasonable.**

A simple, predictable, cash flow positive company that is wildly undervalued and about to pop on stimulus news (back to fair value) and even more in Q1-Q2 on re-opening and widespread vaccination. Given the pent-up demand for social activities like this, the pent-up production supply in Hollywood, and the fact that many are sleeping on this play, a big swing anytime in the next couple of months is possible, making options attractive.

 **Short term price target = $15 (+65% from current levels)**

 **In the medium term = $30 (+230% from current levels)**

**Good luck!**

Title: If you like tendies you should be on the ICLN train
Ive been balls deep in ICLN calls since beginning of December. Why? Because BUYDEN is gonna pump green energy for the next four years. We are redoing the Paris climate accords. We are getting tax credits for green energy. We are building a green new deal. Green, like dollars. Understand tards?

ICLN is a clean energy ETF comprised of 30 highly liquid clean energy businesses, mostly concentrated around residential solar and hydrogen fuel cells (PLUG is an example). Its been sluggish for years, but really picked up steam in November. Since then its been cruising at steady 1$ a week gainz. Gainz are good, you tards.

Ive got 50% of my RH account in ICLN and Im at 125% return for the month. Need more reasons you tards?

Most renewables are  cost competitive with fossil fuels. The cost of residential solar per kWh is less than half of the kWh cost of utility generated power. This is beginning to put tremendous pricing pressure on oil and natural gas. The long term economics favor wind and solar. Dont play the oil bounce back, buy into to the future. Tards.

State corporation commissions are rolling out robust renewable energy and efficiency standards, including states that havent traditionally espoused political interest surrounding climate change. Arizona for example recently unveiled a major REST update that will substantially accelerate the states transition to renewables. This isnt a pump an dump play you tards. This is the future. Buy LEAPs, an watch your red screen turn green. 

Major renewable energy companies like PLUG and RUN are maturing. The solar industry in particular burned a lot of investors as young companies struggled to establish themselves in a volatile market heavily reliant on government subsidy. Thats no longer the case. There are several mature market players that are highly stable, have dynamic leadership, and have proven they can execute amidst changing market conditions. They are well represented in ICLN. Best part is, ICLN is still undervalued. All of her slutty green ETFs are in the 50+ an she still hasnt cracked 30 yet. Dont you want to be there when this slut starts putting out? 

The politics of climate change are settling. This year alone polls found that 67% of Americans dont believe government response to climate change has been good enough, 63% believe stricter environmental laws are worth the cost, and for the first time in history a majority of Americans identify climate change as a major issue for them. Even the average tard knows oil is out. Thats important because Joe BUYTHEFUCKINGDIP Biden won. This means major infrastructure/energy investments, extensions of tax credits for renewables, and a return to reciprocal trade policy on renewable imports. Love him or hate him, BUYDEN is gonna push green energy. Even if it dies in deadlock all of our leaps are gonna print on green new deal talks going well news 

TL/DR green energy makes RH screen go green

Title: Why you should have all your money in Genetics
I saw Cathie's outlook on Genetics and AI combining, and did my research. It has me convinced I should go super long on ARKG. Here is a video from a [MIT AI Chad and MIT Gene Chad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brslF-Cy3HU&amp;ab_channel=LexFridman) \- the first of 3 on this podcast and my key takeaways were: Genes are cool as fuck. AI will do for the genome what it did for chess and Go. These companies have the potential to be the next FAANGs in exponential growth.

This isn't all some hype to make me shoot thiccer rope like Spiderman, but industrial level genetics engineering. Need gasoline? Modify a bacteria to eat plastic and shit gasoline. Need a new organ? Farm that shit off a super pig. Need a specific drug that's expensive to make? Modify a nonspecific fungal enzyme to biosynthesize it. There isn't just one good reason to be long here, there are tons. Shit will actually be a genomic revolution. I think the human genetics stuff is the least interesting actually because of how complicated it will be and all the regulations and red tape. Modifying bacteria/fungus and shit you can culture and scale is going to be the real money. If I could go more specific on those ideas I would but I'll take the ARKG basket for now.

 It's going to disrupt major industries, and I guarantee genetics will help us combat climate change. We'll make bacteria that act as carbon sinks, and then retarded companies will pay tons of moneys to offset their carbon footprint to some assholes with giant vats of this shit in some barren wasteland just eating carbon dioxide and farting oxygen. It's going to change our world and make every industry it touches a level of magnitude more productive. This is the type of generational investment that Apple in 1996 or Google at IPO would have been. 

The keys to unlocking the 'genomic revolution' that ARKG wants are really just processing power and AI. Google is actually important here and will have a hand in the tech end. Deepmind just figured out protein folding. Remember in 2004 when we all tried to cure cancer by running spyware on our computers? It's fucking solved, proteins are solved. These are the building blocks of life and will give us tools to make new novel proteins that actually can turn us into stretch armstrong or make our dicks huge and so on. Now that we figured that out, the next step is learning what genes we can edit to start modifying proteins in our own bodies, or for more profit, bacteria/fungus. You can make a fucking enzyme that eats cancer. This shit is in the pipeline.

tl;dr ARKG any strike. I'm in ARKG 105c 7/16 and wish I had more money to throw at it. There is nothing but room in this whole industry and it will change everything.

Title: PLTR lockdown expiration bullish thesis
First of all not sure if this qualify as DD, if not let me know and Ill change it! 

Did a lot of evening lecture on PLtR...

So many people expect it to drop when share lockdown gets removed sometimes in February from my understanding...

80% of the floats can free trade after this... def gonna be a drop for the SP since a % will take some profit...

However hear me out...

From now until that moment, we can have new NR of deals or renewed deal like we had lately... We will have demo day and ER which will demonstrate a continuation of revenu rise...

An other point I want to talk about is the fact that most of the people with that 80% float... are mostly insider, people with deep knowledge of what is palantir, their power, their goal and their future...

Now if I was working with them with 1 million of shares... lockup ends... if Im convinced in what we do... might sale 10% for lets say around 2.7M$... more than enough to buy nice stuffs... however with that knowledge expecting it to rise probably in a 50-100$ range... wouldnt sell more than that 10% ...

PLTR trade a lot of shares everyday over 50M...

Fund managers couldnt get into an iPO or Spac...

So in short I dont believe the SP will drop that much on the lockup event... either it will have rise enough with the events I spoke about and might test new support of where we are currently consolidating but I truly dont expect a dip under 20$...

Then there will be a strong dip buying from PLTR beeing a meme stock and all the funds wanting to get in while its cheap...

Also if it dosent fall like so many expect...

Im pretty sure its gonna initiate a strong FOMO which could create a strong mania buying and rocket it to over 40$.... weve been cranking up for breakout!

So basically PLTR 30$ calls jan 21, may 40c (could also be shorter like march call

Buying shares and getting some cash ready to buy more when and if that dip occurs...

2021 will be the year where PLTR gets noticed big time

Now off to bed!

TLDR; everyone expect a dip on lockup expiration... inverse them buy everything PLTR before, on the exp and after

Title: Turtle Beach (HEAR) undervalued
I think this stock has gone under the radar and am surprised that not a lot of people are talking about it. To be honest I didnt know Turtle Beach was even publicly traded. 

Upon looking at its financials, I was surprised that it was undervalued for the amount of money theyre making. Even with the recent rise in its stock price, it is still considered undervalued. 

It practically had little debt, good sales and set up for the run long. Anyone disagree?

CRM in the NEWS

**Week of 12/21**

Boomer Joe Terranova said he had to sell Salesforce.com, inc. to raise capital to buy some other stocks. His decision is not about Salesforce being a bad business. He believes in the stock and it screens very high on his quality momentum index. He said he is pairing back the holding because he bought the stock too aggressively, too high.

Terranova is sure over the course of time Salesforce is going to move higher, but he decided to buy stocks that should work better in the near time. He bought other boomer stonks.

On CNBC's "Mad Money Lightning Round," Jim Cramer said Salesforce.com, inc. was up big on Tuesday and it still has a lot more to go.

Title: $INFN is the perfect post-covid play and still a bargain at $11!
Goldman article discussing this a while back: [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/goldmans-turnaround-plays-for-2021-topped-by-las-vegas-sands.html?&amp;qsearchterm=infn](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/goldmans-turnaround-plays-for-2021-topped-by-las-vegas-sands.html?&amp;qsearchterm=infn) \- Semi-blocked for non-paying readers unfortunately.

**Who?**  
Infinera Corp is an established player in the transport market. They do various tech products and services such as cloud, 5G, fiber etc. for especially metro but also long haul and other transportation.

**Financials**  
First off, the company is mature and has a strong focus on gross margin, cost cutting as well as constantly moving into new, growing and promising markets.

From Q1'19 to Q3'20 (GAAP):  
Revenue is up 16.5%  
Gross margin is up from 22.7% to 35.2%  
OPEX is down from $178.1M to $112.6M  
EPS is up from ($.69) to ($.19)

While these financials are solid, they are not the flashiest found in the market. However, it is more so the current situation of the company as well as the outlook that could drive the stock through the roof in Q1 of 2021.

**Circumstances**  
Historically, the number one competitor of $INFN has been Huawei. Because of the recent developments for Huawei's operations in especially North America ($INFN's largest market), American customers are looking to switch to a solid American alternative.

Not only is California-based $INFN an innovative and proven alternative, it is also becoming more relevant in more areas (vertical integration). This makes it an obvious choice because of the all-in-one solutions they can provide for their customers, of which they are gaining by the minute (take a look in their financial statements).

Finally, the central metro market is only growing, both in the US, but also in EMEA and APAC (considerate share of $INFN sales).

**Conclusion  &amp; current stock development**  
As the Goldman article at the top also mentions, $INFN has had negative cash flows and could be about to turn that around due to a few of the points made here. They continue to pivot and move into lucrative positions in very interesting markets with bleeding-edge tech (such as their 800G network transformation technology currently being rolled out) that for many customers can offer a competitive advantage. Moreover, the company is a proven, reliable and innovative alternative to Huawei which is on its way out of especially the American market. This leaves masses of potential value to be captured and to grow with.

Slowly moving on from covid, the economy is in need of new construction and creation meaning a huge rise in projects and therefore potential customers for $INFN. As Goldman agrees, this stock could be in for a rocket-ride in the first half of 2021 when their financials go from promising to delivering.

When the Goldman article came out, the stock went from around $7 to $11 and is now hovering. This could easily prove to be the beginning of much more. The potential value of their market is way bigger than their $2.1B. When their cash flows improve in their statements in 2021 and they continue to capture new customers, especially from their weak competitor of Huawei, this stock will rocket as it should already. Its potential is simply skyhigh (and way higher than $2.1B.

**TLDR**  
$INFN has innovative tech in multiple lucrative markets and a brilliant market situation because of the growing public transportation markets and weakened competitors. Goldman believe they will rocket in 2021 because of cash flows going positive and so do I. Get yourself som calls or shares before the party begins!

Title: MT AND Cleveland-Cliffs, Two peas in a pod, DD
I was doing some research on the MT, DD that u/vitocorlene wrote up, and was quite inspiring, So i decided to do a little digging in..

Every thing on his last DD was to the point but i want to add a second flavor that has become quite interesting, 

Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. has completed its deal to purchase nearly all of  the assets of steel company ArcelorMittal USA for $1.4 billion.

Cleveland-Cliffs says it will be the largest flat-rolled steel producer in North America, and  will also be the largest iron ore pellet producer in North America.

Post deal closure, Cleveland-Cliffs becomes the largest flat-rolled  steel producer in North America. Further, is expected to achieve around $150 million of estimated annual cost savings.

When buying MT you are purchasing there operation around the world, not the US side anymore, but is a loooooong operations list.

ArcelorMittal SA List if subsidiaries (These are what your buying MT on the NYSE) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1243429/000119312508060572/dex81.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1243429/000119312508060572/dex81.htm)Just minus the USA stuff..Most if it.

Cleveland-Cliffs      Lourenco Goncalves--&gt; Gots the vision.....   New Pap Lourneco??? 

Full list of assets purchased by Cleveland-Cliffs [https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2145150-clevelandcliffs-buys-arcelormittals-us-steel-assets](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2145150-clevelandcliffs-buys-arcelormittals-us-steel-assets)

Also the new Alabama facility is a joint venture of ArcelorMittal SA and Nippon Steel, 

Check out the Futures for Steel and Iron, The world is building again especially china, Scrap metal is at a all time high, India is limiting exports to China and Turkey, China can fuck with the price a little but its not enough for the world demand, you can do your own research on this, look into Issues with China and Australia.. and India's Steel production issues 

My reasoning for this Writeup is to pay back the community that i have learned from, I still have no idea what im doing but this Autism has been goood!  

&amp;#x200B;

I like both, Cleveland-cliff has the interesting story, still making up my mind on the numbers for Monday, just like Vito said its a long play to April or June maybe march.

Let me know what you think, 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR, 

 Buy both,  MT and CLF

ArcelorMittal SA has to buy stuff from Cleveland-Cliffs, to make metal in the USA

Title: Apple iCloud experiencing outages due to massive activations today. Bullish AAPL!

Family received several new Apple products today for Xmas. I ran into some difficulty activating them via my iCloud account. I called Apple support and was told by the customer service representative that they were seeing iCloud issues all over due to massive amounts of activations today. 

Yes, we know that this happens every Xmas with Apple but does it ever crash iCloud? No! The super cycle is real. Extremely bullish for Q1 FY21!

Positions: long AAPL shares only, but looking for options expiring mid January to catch run up into earnings. 

Beware your expiration dates because of the classic AAPL buy the rumor sell the news.

Title: Why iRobot $IRBT is Currently Undervalued
iRobot is currently a $2.4B company, with a PE of about 15. This is very reasonable, especially given the bubble-like tech environment. IRBT is a company that has experience creating self-driving robotics. Given the PE ratios of other robotics companies (many of which are all R&amp;D) you would expect the PE to be closer to 30.

This post is not necessarily about the fundamentals of IRBT, but more about how it has been left behind in the tech bubble. This is a company that already has cash flow that can be poured into future robot R&amp;D. 

A reasonable price target for the next 1 year is $120-$150, this would put it back in line with the rest of the industry.

As an options play, IV is also relatively low. One could buy the Jan 2022 $130C and simply make money if/when IV rises, even without a significant rise in price.

Title: $CELH
Hello, this is not investment advice.

LONG CELH.

Upon browsing the [SEC filings](https://www.celsiusholdingsinc.com/sec-filings/) on their page. We see that Celsius maintains a steady control over their assets/liabilities. At any moment they have enough accounting cash on hand to cover their debts. They have an insanely retarded P/E ration of 500ish with a market cap of 3B and this is the exact stock your [fatass](https://www.celsiusholdingsinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CELH_3-20_Investor_Presentation_Final.pdf) needs to get in on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please meet my friend [Peder](https://www.celsiusholdingsinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/img-team-peder-copy-1.png), the Sales Director of Sweden. Every single one of you would buy 30 cases of Celsius if this man looked at you. You would let him autograph your shitty little investor apparel after he single handedly grows this company into an empire. All of your homo-erotic subconscious' rising in tandem to pile cash at his door step. Fundamentals aside I think Peder's smoldering stare will bring every distributor in Sweden on board.

&amp;#x200B;

The man in the top left is [Li Ka-Shing](https://www.celsiusholdingsinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/key_investors_revised-1.jpg). The 30th richest person in the fucking world. He wants Celsius to replace water in Asia. He has passed on the control of his empire to his son, and we all know that it was most likely to avoid an assassination plot for advanced proprietary investment technology that gives them a leading edge over picking the best companies. I believe that technology is still in the hands of the ~~Arasaka~~  Ka-Shing family and will bring them greater wealth over the years. I know this company will be successful because after Li's son was **KIDKNAPPED** in 1996, he quietly payed a ransom of 1B for his sons safe  return like 1B is fucking pocket change. He then used his keen business sense to ensure the fucking **EXECUTION** of the [kidnapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheung_Tze-keung). You think this man will simply allow his investments to fail? Think again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Title: Ocugen analysis
#OCUGEN

Hello everyone, since it is the Christmas season, I have done up an analysis on a company called Ocugen which recently partnered with Bharat Biotech to co-develop COVAXIN. Before I begin, please do your own DD before purchasing of stocks and do not fully rely on my analysis.

##What is Ocugen?
Ocugen is a leading biopharmaceutical company which focuses on discovering, developing and transformative therapies to treat diseases such as blindness. Their breakthrough technology was the modification of gene therapy which has the potential to treat multiple retinal diseases with just one drug.

On the 22nd of December, Ocugen partnered with Bharat Biotech to co-develop the India-based company's COVID-19 vaccine candidate for the US Market. Under the partnership terms, Ocugen would have the US rights to the vaccine candidate and will be responsible for clinical development, registration and commercialization in the US market.

## Update as of today 
https://www.livemint.com/science/health/indian-covid-19-vaccine-covaxin-has-drawn-global-attention-icmr/amp-11608855811924.html

Based on the article above, the Indian vaccine is getting attention from the media and I believe that reporters are starting to be aware of what they are doing.

1) Data generated from phase I and II showed that the vaccine itself is impressively safe, and it has spark Lancet's interest in publishing them. The phase III trial in India is currently ongoing at 22 sites.

2) The last date of enrolment of Phase III would be on 31st December, and we will determine the results by then. If it is successful, then investors like you and I will watch the vaccine being rolled out worldwide.

https://www.freepressjournal.in/bhopal/bhopal-after-giving-1700-volunteers-first-covaxin-dose-second-to-be-given-from-dec-26 

Based on the article above, Bharat Biotech is currently at the Phase 3 of its clinical trials and the first dose has been administered to over 1700 volunteers and it will start giving its second on 26th December. 

https://m.economictimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/pharmaceuticals/bharat-bio-seeks-marketing-nod-again-for-its-vaccine/amp_articleshow/79946393.cms

Based on the article above, Bharat Biotech has recruited over 13,000 volunteers which is half-way mark of recruitment of 26,000 participants for phase III clinical trial of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate.

https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/24/2150312/0/en/Ocugen-Establishes-Vaccine-Scientific-Advisory-Board.html

Based on the article above, the Scientific advisory board consists of established and experienced management levels. It consist of Big players who works in Pfizer

https://www.linkedin.com/in/shankarmusunuri/

Based on his linkedin, he worked for Pfizer for 14 years as their senior director and then became CEO of Nuron which is a vacinne maker. Based on such management level, doesn't it help to build a strong foundation for the company? A simple fundamental to start investing in a company is to have good management team and this checks the box.

## Key efficacy of Bharat Biotech Vaccine
1) Vaccine - Inactivated Virus
2) Percentage of people who developed antibodies - 98.3%
3) Antibody levels - Comparable (1x)
4) Prevalence of serious side effects - None reported
5) Current stage of development - In phase III trial

At the outset, it shows that the vaccine may be comparable or even slightly better than its peers on some parameters. When volunteers are given COVAXIN, 98.4% of them developed antibodies compared at day 56 to 100% at day 28 after the two-dose regimen in the Coronavac trial, based on phase 2 trial data.

## Conclusion
To conclude, I hope that this fundamental analysis will allow the people who FOMO-ed into the stock to have a peace of mind.

For those that have rip, congratulation and hope that you will rip more profit from it.

I'll keep this post updated for any news that are coming in! Peace out and happy investing :D

Title: Buy into $SE before Dec and yr end sales numbers - dd inside
Sea Limited is going to report December sales numbers and year-end sales numbers soon.  See all their past presentations

[https://www.seagroup.com/investor/quarterlyresults](https://www.seagroup.com/investor/quarterlyresults)

They have been producing solid numbers every quarter.  Listing to the earnings call from Q3 they got 99% yoy revenue increase.   Their e-com business is doing well, on 12.12 -  12 million items sold in the first 24 mins of the sale.   The gaming business is doing well. in a recent Ark interview they mentioned many people can't afford consoles or pcs so.   

Sea money is also a big disruptor in the market.  30% of Shopees total gross orders were from a digital wallet.  And now with the license to operate as a bank puts SE in such a good postion.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Get before they report dec and yr end numbers.

Title: Botox - Abbvie
Idiot jock autist here. Tell me where Im wrong. COVID vaccine now shouldnt be administered to those with facial fillings due to increased allergic reactions. BOTOX is $3+bn of Abbvies revenue, right? Potential hit there. Puts on ABBV. Quick drop then recovery. Yeah?

Title: $XL one of the only worthwhile EV plays.
Essentially they offer a way to make existing models of cars into hybrid vehicles. 

Everyone wants to reduce emissions but in the business world profit is king. They do this by using a service like $XL. It will take a long time for EV vehicles to be the status quo. Decades. In the meantime companies like XL will thrive. It is an actual realistic business. They have clients like Coke, Pepsi, DHL, Fedex. Blue chips dont just say hey lets throw out our entire fleet of ICE vehicles in the name of climate change. Hell no. They do the thing that makes them profit while looking good. Which is perfect for $XL.

These guys still have a marketcap lower than $NKLA even though they make actual money, have actual clients and produce actual cars.

Citron tweeted they are long with a target of $60. Citron shorts can be sketchy, although most of the time they are on tgt. They are not superhuman so of course they dont bat 1.000. Short sellers in general are just mistrusted. By they called $NKLA, $INO recently. Jury is still out on $NIO and $PLTR.

Also $XL was about $27 before Citron tweeted. It is now 29.50. So if you belive they are bullshitting thats fine, not like it has pumped much on the tweet so far. I got in at 30 for Feb calls.

The past 2 longs they have callled have been $JMIA which has been on fire. and $RH (restoration hardware). They longed $RH with a tgt of 250 and it is 500 today.

I get the skeptics but occams razor applies here. XL mkt cap right now is stilll smol (144mil shares, $30 a share approx 4.5B mkt cap), and if you do your DD you can see this company has an actual future the risk/reward is good.

Positions: 2/19 $40 + $45 calls

Title: RKT bagholders UNITE: SPAC Wars - A New Hope
CONTEXT:

With the Fed keeping rates low for the foreseeable future, mortgage lenders are poised for further growth.

Quicken Loans - a subsidiary of Rocket Mortgages (RKT) - was the first mortgage lender to go public and capitalize on the low mortgage rate environment. Following suite, United Wholesale Mortgage is going public via SPAC in a merge with G-H-I-V. 

WHAT IS IT?:

Only the largest SPAC deal EVER at a value of $16.1 Billion.

United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) is the largest wholesale mortgage lender in the US and the second largest mortgage lender next to RKT. 

SHOULD I BUY IT?:

In the most recent Quarter (Q3), UWM raked in $1.45B net income. They had 81% year-over-year increase in loan volume, at $54.2B. Per CEO Mat Ishbia on Q3: "This is our best quarter in the companys 34 years, showing that borrowers are recognizing that independent mortgage brokers offer better rates, greater speed and deeper experience."

G-H-I-V currently has over 50% institutional ownership, meaning the big fish are interested. With REITs failing, independent mortgage lending companies have become a new way of capitalizing on the real estate market. More of these companies will be going public in the months to come.

UWM is the first one to IPO via SPAC. RKT priced their IPO at $18 back in August, and they have a much larger market cap.

RKT Market Cap:  41B (2B shares).

G-H-I-V Market Cap: 677M (53M shares).

RKT may have larger market share, but as the second largest contender and due to the vast scale comparison in market cap, I think it's fair to say that G-H-I-V should at least be trading at a higher price than RKT. One of the biggest things keeping RKTs share price down is its bigness. With large institutional ownership parking money like they would in REITs, it makes it difficult for retail investors to move the stock price. With a market cap magnitudes smaller, G-H-I-V has the potential to moon the way RKT has failed to.

WHEN?:

The Special Meeting for approval is happening January 20th at 6am PST. The new ticker will be UWMC. At the current price of $13/share, I believe the upside potential far outweighs the downside. I'm placing my conservative low end PT at $20, but I see G-H-I-V flying much higher than RKT.

TLDR: 

Buy G-H-I-V for the same reason you bought RKT. G-H-I-V will moon the way you hoped RKT would. Buy before the January 20th meeting for max tendies.

First off, let's see what happened last year during earnings. See bolded areas.

&gt;KANSAS CITY, Mo., Feb. 04, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [Cerner Corporation](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=s5ctDogkuwLExiVu-xZ7z8m2mEanLnaHTtywdjDtpXqzSZRyADEleNSuzs1xAD01GiCtkmknLn5b2EDhuKdlqw==) (Nasdaq: CERN) today announced results for the 2019 fourth quarter and full year that ended December 28, 2019.  
Fourth quarter 2019 revenue was $1.442 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to $1.366 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, and ***in line*** ***with the Companys expectations***. Full-year 2019 revenue was $5.693 billion, up 6 percent compared to 2018 revenue of $5.366 billion.  
Bookings in the fourth quarter of 2019 ***were above the Companys expectations*** at $1.665 billion. Full-year 2019 bookings were $5.990 billion compared to 2018 bookings of $6.721 billion. The decline in bookings was primarily driven by the Company being more selective in the types of contracts it pursues, which led to fewer large, long-term outsourcing contracts.  
...  
Adjusted Net Earnings for fourth quarter 2019 were $237.2 million, compared to $208.1 million of Adjusted Net Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2018. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share were $0.75 in the fourth quarter of 2019, ***in line with the Companys expectations*** and up 19 percent compared to $0.63 of Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share in the year-ago quarter.

Everything was mellow and nothing was a huge shocker (this is good). Cool, everything checks out. Investors got what they were told. Here's what Marc had to say regarding adjusted operating margin (*this is important*).

What happened immediately ***after*** earnings last year?

Here is the chart of cerner stock price from 1/1/2020 to 6/1/2020. See the 2/4 Close ($74.22) and the High of 2/5 ($80.90). Stock market reacted very positively.

What happened ***the following weeks/months after*** earnings last year?

Insiders dumped the stock and Starboard off-loaded a small stake initially and gradually. I posted about the insider selling [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cerner/comments/g3sqv8/cerner_insider_sales_vs_cerner_stock_price/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), but I'll add more color below. Look at how much stocks they sold. These guys have been around for 15+ years and if its at a good enough price (to sell) for them, its at a good enough price for me. Starboard has off loaded about a quarter of their initial investment by 9/2020. This is an activist hedge fund. They don't give a shit about prospects beyond five years. They've called out Olive Garden's [breadsticks strategy](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/04/olive-garden-breadsticks-starboard) and once the stock price reach adequate levels they sell. Jeff and starboard doesn't give a shit about Cerner's progress on patient safety, enabling true interop, helping vets. They care about the business model and **ultimately** the stock price. Certain respectable hedgefunds that are [long only](https://www.ft.com/content/1a72e04c-54a7-11e9-91f9-b6515a54c5b1) but starboard **is certainly not** one of them.

About the adjusted operating margin targets.

This goal/commitment was made by Jeff Smith. As an activist investor, he goes into a position/stake and tells management what to do and agitates for a change. Please watch this video [https://youtu.be/uJs1I-Q4hd0?t=551](https://youtu.be/uJs1I-Q4hd0?t=551) and see how much he talks about margin targets as his main objective for the investment.

How does marc achieve this? Expensing alot of shit into one bucket called 'Organizational restructuring and other expense' and calling it an 'adjustment'. The SEC doesn't really care about the non-GAAP (aka non-accounting standards) so Cerner is free to bucket this expense into one line item and leave it vague. Some call this financial engineering or creative accounting. Whatever you call it, this is legal. (GAAP items, on the other hand, have strict guidelines and examples published by the FASB and adopted by the SEC). So as long as Marc is keenly aware of the numerator and denominator to get the margin percent, he can adjust and add/subtract to this 'organizational restructuring and other expense' line item and make it to 22.5%. It comes down to a simple math formula, and its not that difficult to move random shit within that line item.

Going back to Jeff from Starboard. Jeff is intimately aware of Cerner's progress through two avenues. One is through board of directors. Jeff gave Brent some 'choices' for appointing four new directors but really the candidate pools were full of Jeff's homies that would advocate on his behalf. So when Brent 'chose' George, Halsey, and two other randos, they are largely considered agents for Jeff and Starboard. How do I know they are homies? they both worked together with Jeff closely before. These are two examples found online.

&amp;#x200B;

[Sup Georgie BOYYYY](https://preview.redd.it/6nw8hypzm8761.png?width=1186&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86822b7aceb5f67b2edbd08c47915c779f92076a)

&amp;#x200B;



[Sup Halsey?](https://preview.redd.it/rgzsf111n8761.png?width=1471&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ede42f20d2701db2fca8bc173e8f43dbb5cd7608)

Also, Jeff made Cerner hire a turnaround consulting company called Alix Partners. The approx. 20 consultants actually doing the grunt work are currently under 'contractor' status at Cerner and have their own Cerner contractor emails. They report to Kimberly Gerard who is the chief transformation officer at Cerner. So the managing director at Alix Partners has weekly/monthly syncs with Kimberly and has a good pulse of the process. This MD is likely talking to Jeff about the progress through some back channel communication, 110% guarantee.

Here is my prediction for the upcoming earnings.

1. Cerner will meet or exceed most financial metrics/guidance set forth by mgmt during earnings.
2. Cerner will exceed the 22.5% adjusted operating margin for 4Q2020.
3. Cerner will provide some vanilla/generic/maybe-slightly-positive guidance for CY2021. They won't dive deep into it at the earnings because the investor community meeting at HIMSS 2021 will cover that. (btw guidance is a big component of wall street reaction and mgmt knows this so they won't make any major/"draconian" (marc's words) guidance)
4. After-hours and the day after, Cerner stock price will react positively. (If I had to guess: 4+% change)
5. Just like before, in the coming days/weeks/months insiders like Don Trigg / Randy Sims (/other insiders who follow Cerner stock on a daily basis for decades) will file form 4 with the SEC and starboard will file form 13F (which is filed on a quarterly basis) with the SEC showing that they fucking **dumped** Cerner shares.

Between step 4 and 5, I will evaluate my hypothesis and see if it tracks along. If I sense that it is, I am dumping my aspp and 401k cerner shares. 100% of all available/tradable shares. I won't say exactly how much but its in the four digits. I don't give a shit about 15% discount on aspp or .18/quarter dividends. If I really cared about a steady income stream I'd buy SPHD or QYLD that pays monthly.

Let the risks be known. This earnings beat might already be priced in and there might not be much reaction. After all, is the second major hurdle and analyst might already expect cerner to beat it as easily as it did on the first margin goal. If CFO succession plan is still not in place, this might leave some analysts hanging regarding forward guidance philosophy. (let me digress for a bit: Hey Brent, I know you're looking for the next CFO so while you're at it, ask the headhunters to look for a dope COO too... it's been quite a while if you haven't noticed. Fuck a Chief Strategy Officer, largely a symbolic figurehead). Another one could be vague/largely-open-ended forward guidance for 2021 presented during the earnings from covid or something. Also, know that once you sell, you won't be able to vote using the shares (not that retail investor votes ever mattered).

Lastly, I'm not the only one who is 'playing' earnings for Cerner. See options below.

Title: Microbiology PHD estimates there have already been 100,000 reinfections

------ My DD ---------

Reinfections are common given the opportunity [[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/khsw6u/scientists_urge_concern_not_alarm_over_new_virus/ggo8qir/). Reinfections can be used to estimate anti-body half life for anti-bodies created by the vaccine. [[2]](https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/antibody+half-life). Reinfections can also be used as an indicator for B cell immunity, as B cell immunity created via a infection is the same as B cell immunity created by a vaccine. [[3]](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html). Yes, vaccines do provide a greater initial antibody count than a natural infection, but the anti-body half life is the same and short as indicated by reinfections. Bi-annual vaccine boosters are not logistically feasible.

If antigenic drift reduces efficacy rapidly, its a problem. Its not possible to vaccinate for multiple versions bi-annually. [[4]](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1340409968818671616?s=20). "Immune Evasion" can already be seen occuring in the South African strain [[5]](https://sciencespeaksblog.org/2020/12/22/covid-19-south-african-variant-may-be-worse-than-uk-variant/). Suspiciously, there are also 1594 untested and suspected cases in fda report for pfizer vaccine, in vaccinated group. [[6]](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download)

Frequently Asked Questions:

&gt;*"But the FDA cleared it for EUA, so it must be okay"*

The FDA also cleared remdesiver for EUA, and it wasnt okay. [[7]](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/who-recommends-against-the-use-of-remdesivir-in-covid-19-patients)

&gt;*"But I thought reinfections were rare".*

That is misinformation. Reinfections are common given the opportunity [[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/khsw6u/scientists_urge_concern_not_alarm_over_new_virus/ggo8qir/). The probability of these *series of events* is low. [[8]](https://www.mathplanet.com/education/pre-algebra/probability-and-statistic/probability-of-events)

(Chance of infection)   (Chance of genome testing)  (Chance of infection)  (Chance of genome testing)  (Chance of a different strain)

&gt;*"But my B cells will remember".* 

That process isnt working well as indicated by the reinfections. [[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/khsw6u/scientists_urge_concern_not_alarm_over_new_virus/ggo8qir/)

Title: $BABA lawsuit is not political
American neckbeards assume that this is politically motivated but it's not.

All Chinese tech companies have been engaged in anticompetitive practices for twenty years.

As an example, you cannot link to Taobao from WeChat because Tencent blocks it. And vice versa. 

This is an open and shut case. 

Similarly, the blocked ANT IPO was reasonable because they were creating a Chinese version of the 2008 financial crisis with their overleveraged loan business. 

Got fucked on futures, still holding the stock and buying more in January.

Title: Sector DD: AI, Robotics, Genomics, Digital Payments, Cloud Computing, and Batteries Macro Trends will make you rich (aka why ARK holdings are not just memes)
I am so fucking bullish on a number of disruptive technologies (many of which I share with Cathie) and I have been for years. I'm bored at a xmas party so just throwing this out there off the top of my head for all you retards considering hopping on the ARK train. Here is a quick and dirty rundown on why I'm hyper-bullish in these sectors:

**- AI (and robotics):** if you thought the interwebs revolutionized the world by creating new massive industries like e-commerce and social media, wait til AI starts getting involved in a seriously major way. It's in its infancy still as a technology but think about the impact to autonomous driving/ridesharing taxi networks and shipping, traffic engineering and city planning, healthcare, military applications, roboinvesting, manufacturing, precise operations like controlling a spacecraft, advanced chemistry, literally anything that requires predictive analytics or in-depth parsing of huge data sets that a human simply could never do.

Human error and psychological bias are enormous contributors to loss of revenue and life. In 20 or 30 years, any office worker who pushes paperwork or does other menial work could be obsolete if their company can afford an AI software suite that can process that tasking at 10 or 20 or 100 times the speed with essentially zero errors.

Robotics will give AI suites and other software-based decision-making entities the ability to perform physical work. They can keep human operators outside of dangerous or difficult situations. Major manufacturing companies are buying into robotics hard for their production lines.

I like teradyne for robotics and C3 for AI. I am looking for more tickers to buy on both.

**- Precision/Personalized Medicine (Telemed, but largely Genomics):**

Telemedicine and small partially automated clinics will eliminate the need to see a primary care physician or psychiatrist for something as minor as a check up, flu shot, or strep throat swab. Decentralization of healthcare is already a worldwide trend.

Genetic sequencing is the big one. Genome sequencing cost for the first human genome cost $2.7B and 13 years. It is now approaching $1000 - technologies like this are finally at the point where they are ready to go to market and not just R&amp;D pipe dreams. Companies like 23&amp;Me are first movers in bringing personalized genetics to the public. Imagine if you could have a service like that flag the fact that you're likely to develop breast cancer and catch it at stage one? Imagine if it could tell you what kind of beer you're most likely to enjoy? Imagine if you could edit a chronic illness out of your unborn child. There are obviously regulatory and ethical implications here but that won't stop the industry from growing.

I am so fucking bullish on CRSP long-term despite this run up. We are already at a stage where research firms are targeting monogenic diseases (only one gene mutated, easier to fix). CRSP, EDIT and NTLA are the only three companies with patents filed for CRISPR gene editing technology. Buy. The opportunity is so much greater than the premium you think you might be paying to buy this high.

\- **Digital Payments:** Cash payments are at an all-time low in global history yet there is still plenty of room for cash payments to transition to digital. Companies like venmo and square are now up-ending the finance industry by controlling digital cash flow more than traditional banking institutions you are. Answer me this: when was the last time you went to the bank in person to withdraw cash for your daily expenses? For me it was probably 2012. There are entire markets in Africa where people are only just starting to use SMS money-gram type mobile payment things. Mobile payments will rule the world of transactions soon.

P o o p c o i n is extremely controversial right now but at the very least, it is an indicator that **institutional** interest in digital payments and mobile value transfer is strong and growing. You might also consider it more of an asset/store of value than a medium for value exchange, but either way. Adoption is increasing. Access is increasing. Awareness is increasing. Faith in fiat currencies is decreasing (consider Venezuela. lol. and the USD fears recently). These are all bull signals.

Fintech is one of my strongest conviction buys. SQ, PYPL

**- Batteries - Energy storage:**

The global developed economy runs on the combustion engine / fossil fuel power plant. Forget about activism and ESG funds for a second and think about this: *when do new services or technologies get adapted over existing ones that serve a similar function?*

Answer: *when they become cheaper than the status quo solutions.* Battery technology research drive is insane right now as we've seen by the hype around EV and charging tech companies. Batteries are the primary cost driver of an electric vehicle - it's like more than half of the cost of the input material. Once battery prices cross a tipping point and electric vehicles become cheaper than gasoline cars, there will be a mass exodus to EVs. EVs have less moving parts than a gasoline car so they require less maintenance, and they have greater power efficiency too. This may have become a little bit of a bubble recently, but I honestly am so bullish on the long term case I don't care. Ride out pumps and dumps and stay invested in your thesis. Long-term energy storage is also critical for distributed energy networks (imagine people are generating solar at home, banking it, and then using it at night or selling it back to the grid when prices are highest intraday)

TSLA here. not sure what else to add yet. everything else seems pump and dumpy but I am in battery metal mining ETFs hard.

\- **3D printing:**

Industrial 3d printing is huge. Aerospace and medical devices are the best use cases here.

**- Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, Cybersecurity:**

These are critical infrastructure systems needed to create a functional ecosystem for things like AI, robotics, etc, but there are other drives besides. the amount of data collection and analytics worldwide is ATH and will only go up. and people love their smart homes and devices lol. IoT makes technology an environment and not just a device. And cybersecurity is a very necessary thing in a world where everything is increasingly digital and putin is an asshole

Welp that's all folks. thanks for reading and time to crack another beer

Title: Lancadia holdings II Golden Nugget Merger
Lancadia holdings II, holding company owned by Tilman Fertitta is merging with Tillmans casino Golden Nugget to go public in the iGaming space. Golden Nugget is the only iGaming company thats already profitable because of physical location and its already up n running, its the second public iGaming stock and besides draftkings theres no other public iGaming company to invest in, also their CEO is richer than Mark Cuban and an amazing businessman who owns many companies like Landrys restaurant group (bubba gump shrimp, mortons, etc) as well as a lot more, hes always on CNBC everything he touches turns to gold. The merger goes through Tuesday and if you do your research youll see that its virtually guaranteed to merge, ticker will change soon too. Its volume and buyers are ATH along with its stock price, up AH, and people are beginning to FOMO. Im increasing my position Monday while I can. This is going to be big. Gambling at home is the future.

Title: Your monthly reminder that you are missing the rise of LGVW/BFLY
Posted this 79 days ago, now we have a ticker: LGVW/BFLY

The stethoscope is dead. Get ready for the biggest paradigm shift in medical practice since the x-ray

The stethoscope is to the Doctor as the sword is to the warrior; and just as the sword was replaced with the firearm, so to does point of care ultrasound (POCUS)

With increasing ease of access to CT and x-ray imaging, the negative effects of radiation exposure have prompted a shift in medicine toward less harmful imaging.

In steps ultrasound. Ultrasound isnt new of course, but traditionally it has been performed by specialty trained ultrasonographers. it uses sound waves rather than radiation, removing ionizing radiation from the picture. the limitation of the current US model, especially in resource limited or acute care settings, is the time from ordering the study to completion and interpretation by a radiologist (1hr or more) or communities without access to ANY imaging.

US teaching to doctors and advanced practice providers has EXPLODED in the last 3-4 years, with medical schools and residencies integrating US training and fellowships as standard.

In the near future, providers in acute care settings will be expected to utilize US as a diagnostic tool, and it is a very exciting time for many of us.

BUTTERFLY NETWORK has changed the game forever. they offer an US probe that was the first of its kind. it is small, and attached to your phone or tablet and provides very high quality US imaging on demand.

This is HUGE. 

The limitation was cost ($2000). but the cost limitation is over

Yesterday, BUTTERFLY announced their newest generation of POCUS, the IQ+ at the same price as their first generation model.

The first generation model may now be found on ebay by sellers for around ($1000). 

prices are going down and providers now have visual window access orders of magnitude better than the traditional stethoscope.

BUTTERFLY is not yet publicly traded, but its main investors are the BILL and Melinda Gates Foundation.

other companies have followed suit that ARE public:

FUJI FILM
GE
SAMSUNG
HITACHI
TOSHIBA

and others have developed their own versions, but none have offered the diagnostic quality at the price of BUTTERFLY.

Forget big pharma. This is the future. be on the lookout..





EDIT: list of where this may gain traction outside the hospital:

1: VETS
2: battlefield medicine (sweet DoD contracts)
3: pre hospital
4: rural medicine 
5: 3rd world 
6: finding your girlfriends vagina
7: farmers (they do a lot of awesome things with livestock)

Title: GameStop GME Short Interest Update for 12/15/20
Short interest for 12/15/20 (This is the [settlement date](http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=shortintpubsch), 12/11/20 is the trade date) is 68.13M up from [67.98M for 11/30/20](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gme). Again, squeeze hasn't even begun and won't for awhile but who cares stock prices keep climbing the shorts (Melvin Capital) are getting killed. 

Don't get fooled by the shorts/gay bears telling you it squeezed and shorts got out, they said the same thing pre earnings after the run up. As you can see from the SI, nope in fact it went up. How can I tell it short squeezed? When I get consecutive days of trading halts because Melvin Capital are trying to exit GME a stock with very low volume. 

Complaining about their revenue during a pandemic (the majority of sales still come from brick and mortar, physical stores) when all their stores are forced to closed during the end of a god damn console super cycle is retarded. 

[For all the yolos out there know what you're buying, what some more DD listen to uberkikz here.](https://anchor.fm/modernguilt/episodes/EP27--NEXT-STOP--GAMESTOP-MOON-BASE-ensdq6) You're no longer buying for the short squeeze, you're buying for Cohen taking fucken reign on the company. He's no longer sitting on the fence at 9.98% stake. He's at 12.9%. He's in boys.

Merry X-Mas retards.  ****

Title: Tanium Inc
A bit about me, I am a professional in Information Technology, Network Infrastructure, with a background in computer science.

Why TF am I writing this? When TAN hasnt even offered IPO yet? THEY MIGHT!

What company is this?

Tanium Inc.

CEO: Orion Hindawi 

Valuation: 9B

&amp;#x200B;

Why invest in this?

Cybersecurity is possibly the singular most important component of a technology company.

I have personally used Tanium in a professional environment and can attest to; pretty website, ease of use, and top-notch customer support. Having worked in tandem with the support team I was able to implement this technology into an aging network. The company I was working for had a troubled tech environment, and Tanium helped me straighten it out. 

They are a direct competitor to VMware &gt; CarbonBlack, and Cisco &gt; DUO.

&amp;#x200B;

What specifically was troubled?

The need for this technology was highlighted by audits, and investigations into data breaches the company had reported in years prior.

&amp;#x200B;

Why did we choose Tanium over CB or DUO?

We chose Tanium as it was a superior choice to integrate with our current hardware. 

The systems current did not have the processing power to integrate VMware.

The systems were not utilizing Cisco hard/software, so DUO didnt make sense. 

&amp;#x200B;

How?

Endpoint management.

What is that?

An endpoint is any device a user can use to access a network of data.

A device you use to get online or something.

Think enterprise level company employee capacity. Ill use conservative estimates.

5,000 employees across 4 sites. \~1,250 users per site.

How many devices does an employee have? As an engineer, I have; my phone, laptop, deskphone, and work cell.

4 devices per user, 

20k devices need to be managed. 

If I had to provide data for audits, how would I manage this?

The need for a data driven response here is evident. Whats not evident is how important having a seamless, easy to use interface to pull this data from storage.

Tanium has that. So do other EMS, but this one is, IMO the next one to IPO.

&amp;#x200B;

How does it manage an endpoint?

**Authentication**. This is the name of the game in technology transmission. How can I trust that you are who you say you are?

Without getting too technical, to access the network, you need a hall pass.

No hall pass, no access. Period.

Tanium allows you to essentially mirror your Active Directory, allowing you per user rules and regs.

&amp;#x200B;

**Accounting ,** 2FA. Two factor authentication. This is important in tech because it is a user triggered authorization method.

It provides an additional layer of security for network and user devices. 

This is linked from the network to the user work phone, and requires user input to complete an authentication exchange.

&amp;#x200B;

**Reporting** is done using an archival of enterprise wide specifications filtered by user requirements. All of the user data is hashed and stored inside the Tanium containers that are built inside the network.

Wait, why am I building this shit inside my network?

PCI, PII.

This is mission critical data. If where you store these acronyms are breached, byebye tendies, byebye public life. See Solarwinds, Equifax.

For report generation, you pick what you wanna show, and you dont get to hide or edit what is shown.  

The above is incredibly important to pass audits. Deloitte and Bahne love working with Tanium.

THIS IS A GOOD THING

&amp;#x200B;

Tanium securely stores this data on your premises, and your terms.

How?

Tanium will provision secure containers that will act in tandem with traffic management.

Firewall wont break your shit because Tanium CS works with your IT dept to set this up, and to allow the traffic to traverse securely.

They give you boxes to put in your local interweb, and help you stay in your damn lane.

&amp;#x200B;

Why is Tanium different than anyone else?

In June Tanium partnered with Salesforce to the tune of 100MM.

&amp;#x200B;

What does Tanium stand to gain?

[https://www.meritalk.com/articles/tanium-gets-750-million-dod-contract-for-cybersecurity/](https://www.meritalk.com/articles/tanium-gets-750-million-dod-contract-for-cybersecurity/)

Tanium was awarded a 750MM DOD contract over 5 years to provide cybersecurity. It would stand reason that maintaining performance, or improving would warrant increased contract priority. 

But this is not a meritocracy, and I know 0 about how govt works in that way.

Why do I think they are going to succeed?

They just moved to Seattle from SF Bay. Citing misalignment with government oversight.

This means they are thinking about their future.

After having reports surface about hostile work environment, Orion made changes to remove himself from day to day oversight and installed new management. This has been viewed positively.

&amp;#x200B;

My completely unfounded estimates:

If they IPO at 20$, 20M shares, 4b

I could see

6mos 

28$

1yr

40$

I want to get in at 20 per, and get half out at 30. Then hold til earnings.

SO, I am bullish on this.

Please DM if you have any tips or pointers. Thanks for reading. Happy Holidays my dudes.

**Tanium**

The Emeryville, California-based cybersecurity company was valued at $6.5 billion after its $200 million raise in October 2018. **CFO and COO Fazal Merchant would not rule out a 2020 IPO when he talked to** ***Mergermarket*** **last March**. However, **VMwares** $2.1 billion acquisition of **Carbon Black** in August may put more endpoint security companies like Tanium in the crosshairs.

Just a reminder in the Chinese calendar of 2021 its year of the ox which basically means year of the Bulls get your weekly OTM calls

Title: CDXS is a bet on protein optimization and genetic sequencing
I own stock and calls on CDSX.

Codexis is a significant holding of ARKG, and it's my favorite company in their portfolio. CDXS has a technology called code evolver that combines AI, high-throughput screening, and a catalog of proteins/enzymes that are relevant for biotherapeutics. The code evolver helps major pharma companies to optimize the enzymes/proteins used a fuckload of industries (think specialty chemical development, biotherapeutics, treatments for genetic disorders, specialized proteins suspended in liquids, and TONS of others. The code evolver can help CDXS and their partners to optimize an enzyme for the procedure that it's used for. Recent successful partnerships with MRK, GSK, Allergan have shown that the code-evolved proteins are performer better, lasting longer, and (in some cases) with reduced side effects. 

Here's the beautiful part: It seems like Codexis's partnerships with the pharma companies gives them equal rights to the developed molecules. In other words, the biggest, smartest biopharma companies are paying codexis in order to pay for codexis's research. And if MRK/GSK/etc. discover a breakthrough, CDXS (1.5B market cap), will benefit. 

In case anyone cares, this technology could benefit a LOT of sick people. People diagnosed with uncurbable genetic disorders will have better and better treatments that will SIGNIFANCTLY improve quality of life. I believe it will also lead to new treatments down the road. Unfortunately, there is still no cure for autism.

Title: GME DD fresh perspectives Pt 3 Future of Gamestop + Squeeze teaser. Christmas Edition.
Guys, Im sorry I did not do a good job at painting the picture yesterday. I was pretty tired from a 4 hour hike and I really wanted to put it up earlier than later so more people would be exposed to it.

A lot of what I wanted to deliver got lost in the Amazon vs GME. I see it myself. Thank you to all that offered constructive criticism.

**If you still have any doubt that Gamestop is going back down to $16.00, I invite you to take a few minutes to read this as this would put the concern to rest. This DD is a bit longer, but I have never been more confident that this would put your concern to rest.**

Here we go:

**The Future of Gamestop/PowerUP**

**How many of you guys have one of these? Phones, GoPro, drones, VR gear, tablets, gimbal stabilizer?**  
   
 Of those who answered yes which would be everyone, how many of you did one of these with the old device when you upgraded?

 A) Sold it on eBay and hoped to god every day you dont get scammed until they could no longer open a case against you or pray USPS doesnt lose the item or get delayed and have the buyer open a return/case as a result. 

B) Sold it on Craigslist/Facebook/Kijiji and dealt with time wasters/low ballers/no-shows blowing up your phone which could only made you look popular in front of your crush only to finally have someone show up to offer you $50.00 less than your price which you clearly stated was a FIRM price because of a scratch you mentioned in the ad was worse than they thought or thats just all they had.

C) Gave it to a friend/relative/stash it in your drawer because you cant be bothered with A or B

D) (Phones only) Dont really love your friends/relatives as much as you love what you can do with the cash/they dont want it more than you want the cash but dont want to deal with A or B so you just took a lowball offer At&amp;T, Verizonetc gave you which was easily $100\~200 below the fair market price?  
   
  **How many of you guys are ok with buying one of those devices used but you ultimately end up buying new because of:**

 A) Getting scammed, buying a fake device/something being broken etc etc

 B) You cant be bothered to deal with sellers who are not honest in their description. 

 C) The ideal unicorn seller is too far away.   
   
 **Can you relate? Of course you can.**

One day you buy a 1080P drone, next year they come out with 2.7K, next year they come out with 4K, year after that they come out with a 4K that fits in your pocket, and you cant help but feel like you are just living in the past, or at least, left feeling like you are holding the bag like you bought PLTR at $29. 

I have some of those devices, and I end up upgrading AT LEAST one of them every 1\~2.5 years just like you.  
 

*  Wouldnt it be nice if there was a place nearby that you can just go to get a fair value for your trade in (maybe $50 less than you could get online but you dont have to waste any time)? 
*  Wouldnt it be nice if there was a brick and mortar place nearby you can count on that cant just change their number/disappear tomorrow, have the ability to deliver your order to you in 1 hour AND offer returns AND offer 90 days warranty? What? I can buy extended warranty too?  
* If there was one, and you just had to pay $50 on top of what you could find them for online otherwise, would you really bother with anything else? Would anyone?   
   
 

**Dont think about Gamestop for a second and be honest with yourself. If you answered yes to all 3, upvote this post. If you answered no to any of the above, just give it some time. You just havent experienced the inconvenience/pain yet.**

 Ok, I get your point but there is no one that can offer something like this. Not **yet.** 

 Look, I know back in our days, Gamestop is where you went to get hustled but thats going to change 180. Gamestop will change its name to PowerUp to be relevant in the broader consumer electronics field while retaining its gaming foundation.

 So Ryan Cohen showed you guys that hes serious about buying Gamestop upping his stake recently. It also said in 13D that he will do whatever is in the shareholders best interest. There was no new 13D posted today. **Meaning? The price rise was organic this week. Not from him buying. Shorts shook you a couple of times. You guys held. You guys did very good.**  


Have you ever looked into what Chewy does in terms of customer service? Have you read up anything about Ryan Cohen to see what he/his father stands/stood for when it comes to customer experience? They are about selling goods that will make the customer the most happy not selling stuff that makes the most profit, funny enough, profit follows when you give customers what would make them the most happy and you end up making the most profit anyways. I speak from experience. 

What made Bezos so successful is his focus on customer experience also. All entrepreneurs out there, please remember my spiel about customer experience at least. Its the realest thing I or anyone can tell you. Do not ever fight with customers. Kill them with kindness if anything.  

I bet you my last dollar this is what Cohen sees in Gamestop. The locations, the brand presence, 55M PowerUp members many of whom are already cultured on going through Gamestops revolving door because you get more store credit than cash and you are just accustomed to it. 

**But cmon man $50? How is the company going to make any money?** Look at the spread between bid and ask. Its $50 each way from the mid-price (fair market price). Thats $100.00 profit for the company.

 Still, only $100.00? Yeah, thats actually 2X what they make off of console sales. 

Every one of you, I know you said yes to my questions above, so do the math, upgrading at least one of the devices every 1\~2.5 years. Under this vision, it will be like 10 new consoles are being released every year for Gamestop AT LEAST. It will AT LEAST outdo BestBuy 26.55B market cap. Meaning Gamestop will do at least 20X within the next 5\~10 years. 

**Yeah but Amazon sells used too? Didnt you see?**

Not like this. Used items on Amazon is more like buying stuff on eBay. Often relying on the sellers description and the sellers shipping. Can you drop your item off to Amazon and get cash? No

Imagine, the items are accurately described, it arrives in 1 hour via Doordash/Uber eats and there is no fuss no muss.

 Then, after you bought the device, they just do this 1 simple thing. 

 1 week after you bought the thing they send you a text   
   
 *Hey Autist, just wanted to check in, hows your new dildo flexing so far? Its gwon? Iight, good to hear. We are here if you have any questions/concerns. Have a nice day*

Cohen will do at least this. I guarantee you, except he will add some more personal/relatable touch like the 4K 69 Mega Pixel camera on that bitch really is something else huh? As a cherry on top, there it is, one thing we cant mistake as anything else. A FUCKIN ROCKET EMOJI at the end of the message. Wouldnt you feel loved?   

**Oh yeah, add this to the books.**   
  With millions of us retail WSB autists holding GME, think about what that does for the PR when the squeeze happens and it WILL HAPPEN because $16 is where all the shorts are under water, and we ARE NEVER going below that. Theyre paying fees right now and they will eventually cover. 

Good chance the squeeze will happen like Teslas, 4X ing+ over a couple of months as they start to prove their vision and show that they are there to stay. (Source A). This is how it typically squeezes against diamond hands, diamond balls institutional shorts. 10X ing++++ as they bring their vision to reality. 

&amp;#x200B;

[See October 19 to Feb 20](https://preview.redd.it/zag3ukfz57761.jpg?width=959&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba0b9ad0b7878c5f6fd49829d2fe16e719320ee4)

That is, of course unless Cohen was just waiting for the new year for tax purposes to announce that oh yeah guys, I actually have enough options, shares now to buy the company  

He rides the squeeze, sell 25% shares, profit from that alone will pay for the business acquisition when it comes back down to its value as it is today of around $0. The positive profit they would MOST CERTAINLY generate from this console cycle will more than pay for the restructuring. He still remains a major shareholder with 25%. His best interest will always be scaling GME. Sherman for example, he owns 2% Bezos owns a little over 10%

**Do you want to think really long term?**

 YouTube knew from Day 1 they were going to put ads one day, but they wanted to make it as sweet as possible for it to be engrained in you first  think video, think Youtube.   
   
  The day will come, think upgrading your device, whether it is new or used, think **PowerUP (more suitable name than Gamestop while retaining the gaming image)**

   My point is, that they can increase the $100 spread if they wanted to if you are still so hung up on making only $100/device when I could easily run around myself as a nobody with no store, no reputation and flip 20 devices/week. Try it. Consumer electronics is SUPER LIQUID.   
     
   How about this? When you bring your trade in, you get only $50 less than the classifieds resale value when you take store credit, but if you want cash, we can only give you $75 less than the classifieds resale value  
   There, I just made the spread 50% more, $150 profit/device for Gamestop, and I made you more likely to return. Happy? 

Bezos knew he wasnt going to sell just books down the road.  
Elon Musk knew he wasnt signing up to build just cars.   
Successful business people like Ryan can anticipate moves years down the road. 

The sky is the limit.

**We are just at the beginning, and I'm not done yet.**   
**You think I'm out to lunch? They're already getting started (as mentioned in Pt2 of my DD). If you really can't relate, it's ok, it's probably because you are deep in #1 (as mentioned in Pt1 of my DD)** 

My position:  Shares as well as options JAN 15 15C, 30C, APR 16 30C. GME makes majority of my port. 

P.S :   

   Ryan, if you are reading this. I know you see the picture because it's the obvious picture. Im in the space, and youre right on the money in regards to the things you preach and do in regards to customer service/customer experience.   
I got some ideas I can offer from writing these DDs, I see where you can save in shipping, how the listing system should be so all employees can take pictures and describe the items with consistency like how all McDonalds employees can make burgers with consistency etc etc just to start. Feel free to reach out to me.  
No? Ok, you will compete with me a few years down the road. Just kidding.   
   
**To all you guys &amp; Ryan. Happy Holidays/Merry Christmas.**   
**Wishing you and your family nothing but the best this holiday season, yours truly**

Title: BABA tumbles and falls. Is it the perfect time for aggressive investors to buy some shares before it stabilizes back up?
Pretty short term strategy. I think people talking about the BABA fall are correct in that it will return to normal. Could just be damage control tho? Stocks or options what's my play?

Title: Xmas Present!! More $SKLZ DD inside!
Courtesy of The Great Correction 

Valuation Disparity...

U currently 800M in revenue.
SKLZ currently 250M in revenue.

250/800 = .31 or 31%

So SKLZ should be valued at 31% of U's current market cap based on total revenue.

U current market cap 45B

45(.31) = gives us SKLZ market cap with U's valuation... 14.06B

SKLZ current market cap... only 7B @ $20

14/7 = 2

We need to multiply the current share price by 2 to get to a 14B market cap.

2($20) = $40

So if SKLZ is just valued like it's peers, it's ALREADY a $40 stock WITHOUT the 100%+ growth they will experience over the next 24 months.

$80+ in 2022.

It's just math.

SKLZ is a BIG FAT gift here.

People will catch on eventually.

Good Luck.

Title: PLTR: The Golden Child of WSB 
Merry Christmas Eve people its time to give the jolly gift of Palantir to your loved ones. On this shortened market day I bought the dip on PLTR as it was down about -3.5%. 

I believe that PLTR is a solid company and I have a PT of $40 within the next 3-4 months, so this is the play. 

Position: March 19 $40C 

The DD:
- As some of you might know PLTR is still not profitable but I have faith that the PayPal mafia will turn that around for the company. this companies leadership is incredible and it will be shown in the upcoming month. Also the CEO has ties with Papa Elon so thats always a plus. 

-In addition, we have all seen how PLTR reacts to catalysts and as it hovers in the 25-28 dollar range it is primed for another moon mission. The March calls allow enough time for a serious catalyst to run up the price. 

-Also. EARNINGS BABY!!!! PLTR will report earnings on March 15 and we all know the pump that will result from this. This is close to expiration but the run up to earnings will pump up the value of the option, and the plan is to sell before Theta and IV fuck you. 

-Finally, the sentiment around PLTR is amazing. Many funds are buying it or already bought into it pre-ipo. They are all long on this company and I expect a PT boost from many institutions and hopefully this will happen early into the new year

All in all, PLTR MOON MISSION and my the tendies be with you, always.

Title: MindMed (MMEDF) DD 
Because MMEDF hasnt gotten the attention it deserves, I have decided to give you retards a DD as an early Christmas present. Hovering just above $3, MindMed is a severely undervalued stock flying right under your noses. MMEDF is a psychedelic alternative medicine biotech company that is in the business of curing mental illnesses, (i.e. depression, anxiety, PTSD, and addiction) with psilocybin, LSD, etc. Studies have shown the safety of these drugs for medical use as well as its non-addictive nature. 

Now, what Im about to tell you might change your life if you retards listen. I know you all cant read, but try to sound these words out. 2021 WILL BE THE PERFECT STORM FOR MMEDF: 

1. Because of covid, mental health issues have spiked higher than Elons rocket launch to space. This is a serious issue, and MMEDF has a serious solution. They are making strides in the development of their drugs and are closer to getting them approved by the FDA. 

2. Going public: **MMEDF filed for a preliminary prospectus offering of 18,200,000 units for CAD$4.40 (the issue price) or USD$3.41.** What are you not seeing here!? This comes at the perfect time as the COVID stimulus bill has just been passed, giving you more paper to invest in this company with your paper hands. Just look at Compass Pathways (the first psychedelic med company to hit the NASDAQ). They have exploded and I see even more potential in MindMed as a company. With an influx of equity capital, the companys abilities to perform in this market will be amplified.

3. State regulations against psychedelic alternative medicine are starting to go away one by one. Denver, Colorado led the wave in decriminalizing psilocybin, and now cities in California have followed suit while Oregon becomes the first state the authorize its use. Expect many more to come, just like the legalization of marijuana. Since these are effective medical applications, the industry will become legitimized.

**4. MMEDF is heavily backed by Mr. Wonderful aka papa OLeary.** After talking with scientists and experts in this field, he put his money where his mouth is. He is showing us the future of medicine and its superior applications to mental health compared to the shitty/addictive meds typically prescribed.

5. Johns Hopkins Study[Johns Hopkins study](https://hopkinspsychedelic.org/achievements):

The Psilocybin experiment led to nearly 70% of participants rating it as one of the top 5 most meaningful experiences in their life. This study provides many more examples on the efficacy and success rate on psychedelics, like psilocybin. Hell, there was even a smoking cessation trial and the study showed that 80% of participants were smoke-free after 6 months of psilocybin treatment - drastically higher than typical success rates with the most effective at sub 35%. There is a plethora of uses for this alternative form of medicine and MindMed continues to advance the technology behind it.

Lastly, do your own DD and see what Im talking about.. or dont, but either way **lets go to the moon** 

Title: - [DD] Why I'm long $TLRY
TLRY, or Tilray, is a Canadian cannabis company that is also incorporated in the US, and it was the first cannabis company to IPO on the NYSE. The stock IPO'd at $17 per share and rose to $218 per share before crashing to where it is now at around $8.50 a share. I'm sure some people remember this shitshow.

The recent news that brought them back into the spotlight was the announcement that Tilray will be merging with Aphria. This will create the world's largest multinational weed company by revenue. Here's a list of some other big partnerships:

1. $100 million joint venture with AbInBev (world's biggest beer maker) to research THC drinks. (2018)
2. $250 million revenue sharing deal with Authentic Brands Group as a branding partnership basically. (2018)
3. Tilray acquired Manitoba Harvest, the world's largest hemp foods manufacturere for $317 million. 
4. Tilray acquired Smith &amp; Sinclair, a CBD-infused edibles company (2019).
5. Tilray acquired a cannabis retailer Four20 (2019).
6. Merger with Aphria (Dec 2020).
7. They also have research partnerships with University of Sydney, University of British Columbia, New York University, and others.

The point of all of this is to say that this company's stock is undervalued now, especially from where we've seen meme stocks be able to go. There's definitely a big potential for the biggest weed stock in the world to rally on retail investor hype.

Title: Brand new SPAC at NAV with Uber SVP and Google CEO: $XPOA
merry christmas my fellow autists, if you're tired of chasing gme, tsla, and whatever the meme stock of the week is, i got some serious dd for you

[XPOA](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201021005518/en/DPCM-Capital-Inc.-Announces-Pricing-of-Upsized-300-Million-Initial-Public-Offering) is a SPAC that just split recently and is still at like 10.50 but i doubt it'll stay around NAV for much longer. 

the SPAC is lead by Emil Michael, who was SVP of Uber and imo most importantly, it has Eric Schmidt as a board member. Eric Schmidt is the former CEO/Executive Chairman/Technical Advisor of motherfucking Google/Alphabet for over a decade. this SPAC literally has the fucking ex-CEO of Google on it.
it's also got Betsy Atkins, never heard of her but she's super well connected across a ton of different well known companies, check out her linkedin profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/betsy-atkins-a36b114?challengeId=AQHNH9CaoEXDkwAAAXaQQaEaDTuJrOQkU40n0r3Ld6tHDYy1XRnDYckr8YxSX9BVpV-1MGAeU7TeigYD-wV-vj9B9E89BPUKdA&amp;submissionId=690e5055-ad62-5316-a1fd-117bdae7ac7a).

they're going to target a tech unicorn with a value around 1 to 2 billion, i'm sure you've all seen the SPAC gains recently so get the fuck in here before it takes off

Title: REPOST: Free Tendies for Aut*sts CLDR (10BAGGER) for your PORSCHE TAYCAN through CLOUD COMPUTING HIGH TECH SaaS UNICORN
Someone took down my DD??? Why? I have to repost this shit now. At least lmk why its taken down

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 You may have seen my previous DD for VST from 2 days ago which brought in 30% return the day after so check me out:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/khopcv/guarenteed\_tendies\_in\_renewable\_energy\_vst/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/khopcv/guarenteed_tendies_in_renewable_energy_vst/)

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Retards it's me, Jordan Belfort, and I'm about to fund your Porsche Taycan purchase so listen up.

CLDR - CLOUDERA

Cloudera, Inc. is a US-based software company that provides a software platform for data engineering, data warehousing, machine learning and analytics that runs in the cloud or on premises.

Sounds good right? It gets better.

CLDR is similar to Palantir in its service as a SaaS (software as a service) company, and with its recent announcement of the successful completion of a covenant lite, $500 million senior secured term loan, CLDR bought back 26 million shares.

[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cloudera-completes-500-million-term-loan-and-repurchases-26-million-shares-301198214.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cloudera-completes-500-million-term-loan-and-repurchases-26-million-shares-301198214.html)

At $15 a share, CLDR has a 4 billion dollar market cap. Compare this to PLTR, which has a near 50 billion dollar market cap. That means PLTR is 10X bigger than CLDR, and this is where it gets interesting.

Another retard recently did a DD on this company and here is their analysis of CLDR vs PLTR:

"Though PLTR has higher quarterly revenues, CLDR has much better gross profit margins (81% most recently and increasing vs 63% for PLTR), likely due to their revenue mix being more heavily weighted in software subscriptions vs services. For the latest quarter, CLDR had 91% of revenue from subscription software sales and 8% from services, while PLTR doesnt seem to break this out in their 10-Q. CLDR subscription software margins are 87% as of last quarter. PLTR has a 3.5x higher cost of revenue which all but confirms that their mix is much more heavily weighted towards services with 10-20% margin vs subscription software that has 80%+ margin."

If you couldn't tell from that paragraph, CLDR is literally more profitable than PLTR. Yet it is valued at a tenth of what Palantir is.

Additionally, these premiums could not be any cheaper. [waffles.finance](https://waffles.finance/) shows us calls for JAN 2022 20C are literally at 2 dollars. The contracts are trading at an insane discount since this company is extremely lowkey. However, since we are bag chasers, we buy closer expiration dates, with Feb 2021 calls trading below 1 dollar and they are barely out the money.

POTENTIAL NEGATIVES:

With the recent news of the stock buyback and the increased global awareness about this company, institutions are gobbling up shares, and the stock price has recently jumped from 13 dollars to 15 dollars. This recent jump in price, however, should not stop you from buying into this company, as it continues to remain undervalued.

Short Interest remains low, even with this recent jump.

[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/CLDR/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/CLDR/short-interest/)

To sum it up, you can buy short term. You can buy long term. Either way, if you buy Cloudera, you're making a 10bagger.

Title: Hello $BABA holders, please don't $ROPE
I am Chinese, or used to be years ago at least by nationality. I am not going to post Chinese news article detailing the entire power struggle, just English. I mean, you monkeys can't read moon runes.

You see, the power struggle has been happening since Alibaba and Jack Ma became the ecommerce god of China, like Jeff "the bald Grinch" Bezos did with Amazon in America. China are commies, worshipping anyone but the party is illegal. That is why despite the profits and everything else, they are still sitting at 300+ and not flying like AMZN. Chinese know the power struggles all to well, smart ones will avoid it like plague. Not even Chinese boomers are touching it.

https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Mystery-video-suggests-power-struggle-in-China

The previous power struggles resulted in Ma forced out of CEO position in 2018, cue lip service to western friends who don't give a fuck just to make sure BABA don't drop. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/10/18/alibabas-jack-ma-spent-10-years-preparing-for-his-retirement.html

But like anyone who had felt the power trip of being the richest and most powerful man before, Ma could not stay retired and out of the limelight for long.

So he came out of retirement with the biggest fintech IPO in Asia, Ant Group. Now, that really pisses the Emperor off. Recognising his efforts in revolutionalizing ecommerse, Emperor Xi decided to let him spend the rest of his life in retirement... like a charity case. Yet he decides to step in limelight again, and overshadow the most ~~paranoid and insecure~~ powerful man in all of China?! Well Emperor is the party and party is the Emperor, now Emperor finally decides that you must be removed. Especially when they are showing the entire China the power and money capitalism brings. Cue CCP vs CEO power struggle round 2, except this time they are clashing in the open.

https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/China-up-close/Analysis-Xi-sees-Alibaba-and-Tencent-as-rising-threats-to-power

So what happens?

Buy the dip??

Cut losses and run???

Answer is simple:

If you are holding stocks then just keep holding it. BABA isn't going anywhere, they are the ecommerce monopoly along with Tencent in almost the entire Asia. The dip will not stop until power struggle turmoil is over, it will get even uglier over the months as Politburo falsify more charges to threaten the CEOs to back down.

Recover your call losses with puts, it really is that easy.

I have no options in it because I hate commies and know how they work. So until there is a clear winner in the power struggle, I am not gonna be a bad retard. If you want to listen, cool. If you think it's the dip you were waiting for, good luck with welfare because I tried. Then again I YOLO 50k each on GME and PLTR so what do I know?

Title: Free Tendies for Autists CLDR (10BAGGER) for your PORSCHE TAYCAN through CLOUD COMPUTING HIGH TECH SaaS UNICORN
You may have seen my previous DD for VST from 2 days ago which brought in 30% return the day after so check me out:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/khopcv/guarenteed\_tendies\_in\_renewable\_energy\_vst/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/khopcv/guarenteed_tendies_in_renewable_energy_vst/)

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Retards it's me, Jordan Belfort, and I'm about to fund your Porsche Taycan purchase so listen up.

CLDR - CLOUDERA

Cloudera, Inc. is a US-based software company that provides a software platform for data engineering, data warehousing, machine learning and analytics that runs in the cloud or on premises. 

Sounds good right? It gets better.

CLDR is similar to Palantir in its service as a SaaS (software as a service) company, and with its recent announcement of the successful completion of a covenant lite, $500 million senior secured term loan, CLDR bought back 26 million shares.

[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cloudera-completes-500-million-term-loan-and-repurchases-26-million-shares-301198214.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cloudera-completes-500-million-term-loan-and-repurchases-26-million-shares-301198214.html)

At $15 a share, CLDR has a 4 billion dollar market cap. Compare this to PLTR, which has a near 50 billion dollar market cap. That means PLTR is 10X bigger than CLDR, and this is where it gets interesting. 

Another retard recently did a DD on this company and here is their analysis of CLDR vs PLTR:

"Though PLTR has higher quarterly revenues, CLDR has much better gross profit margins (81% most recently and increasing vs 63% for PLTR), likely due to their revenue mix being more heavily weighted in software subscriptions vs services. For the latest quarter, CLDR had 91% of revenue from subscription software sales and 8% from services, while PLTR doesnt seem to break this out in their 10-Q. CLDR subscription software margins are 87% as of last quarter. PLTR has a 3.5x higher cost of revenue which all but confirms that their mix is much more heavily weighted towards services with 10-20% margin vs subscription software that has 80%+ margin."

If you couldn't tell from that paragraph, CLDR is literally more profitable than PLTR. Yet it is valued at a tenth of what Palantir is. 

Additionally, these premiums could not be any cheaper. [waffles.finance](https://waffles.finance) shows us calls for JAN 2022 20C are literally at 2 dollars. The contracts are trading at an insane discount since this company is extremely lowkey. However, since we are bag chasers, we buy closer expiration dates, with Feb 2021 calls trading below 1 dollar and they are barely out the money. 

&amp;#x200B;

POTENTIAL NEGATIVES:

With the recent news of the stock buyback and the increased global awareness about this company, institutions are gobbling up shares, and the stock price has recently jumped from 13 dollars to 15 dollars. This recent jump in price, however, should not stop you from buying into this company, as it continues to remain undervalued.

Short Interest remains low, even with this recent jump.

[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/CLDR/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/CLDR/short-interest/)

&amp;#x200B;

To sum it up, you can buy short term. You can buy long term. Either way, if you buy Cloudera, you're making a 10bagger.

Title: Nice GME "Short Burn" you fucking retards.
This is my dd. I've followed the mainstream trends on this subreddit and managed to lose $600 in 3 days. Down around $1k since the beginning of the week. You are all always wrong, why is that? Any trade I make on my own accord shows decent-minimal gains but this fucking place has me spending daytrades left and right.

Go to the fucking dog park and ask bitches about BarkBox, everyone is throwing money at their pandemic puppies and those little shits will play/eat anything so those subscriptions will never get cancelled (until the dog dies, but that's a 10 year later problem)

*Regarding GME:* Hope you all enjoyed the RC-fueled tendies, what a day yesterday. I still strongly believe in the MOASS and believe the squeeze has not squoze yet but my goal is 8 digits or bust in &lt; 1 year so I'm mother-fucking chad-ing it up and going to TIME the market, meaning riding STIC/BARK up 2-5X and then jump back into GME for another 2-5X. Fuck you Warren Buffet and your 90 y/o "time in the market" boomer bullshit. The next pandemic in 2025 might wipe us all out anyways, I ain't got time to wait for retirement. Gotta will it into existence. YOLO

Title: Retard posers
Scam alert! In case you arent a  autist you likely didnt realize we have a bunch of fakers on this site. Everyone goes around touting their retard status, no one talks about this as an issue. If we have the wherewithal to call ourselves retards, we likely arent. You think a full on retard knows they are retarded? Not a chance. That means we have a bunch of normal fucks (NFs) pretending to be retarded. WSB is the investing version of the movie The Ringer. We are all acting retarded trying to impress our wifes boyfriend. Thats why most of you cant make a good investment decision if your life  depended on it. You arent a retard, you are pretending to be a retard and your acting sucks.  

Some of you have glasses as thick as the bottom of a coke bottle and are well on your way to the moon. However, most of you are talking with a fake lisp and intentionally drooling on your  fake tendies so you can claim you are a retard. This isnt regular life where NFs guide retards, this is WSB where true retards guide the NFs. Dont be an idiot and follow an NFer in retards clothing. If the stock pick sounds too good to be true, a retard didnt pick it. 

There is a reason the stock market is green and red, its so that color blind retards dont know if they have gains or losses. Lets finish the year out strong!

Title: Back at it again with Progressive - PGR
TL;DR - PGR 100c 2/19/2021 @ 1.45

TL;DR at the top because you guys cant read the back of a cereal box without forgetting where you are. 

Yo. Its me. The cinemark[Cinemark](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j5sukq/cinemark_cnk_sell_off_is_overreaction/) guy. Some of you may also know me from the chat with my (redacted - banned ticker), EA and AMC wins(youre welcome). Im back with the boomer train today trying to get some DD in this sub that isnt GME or Tesla. 

[My previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/imfeub/play_progressive_earnings_for_big_money_dd/) on Progressive made a good little chunk of change swing trading but now I think its liftoff time. 

-Vaccines (while slower than expected) are ramping up exponentially. People will be going back to work and kids desperate to leave the fucking house will be getting their cars and moving about for the first time in a year. Youll see the benefit of the pop in drivers (premium) without the crashes theyll bring in the next 6 months. 

-As my previous post explains, less people on the road have resulted in significantly less claims. Progressive made bank on people who didnt wanna cancel their registration (no insurance means your registration gets canceled) so they stayed at home with their cars. 

-Earnings is 1/27. The 2/19 play will cover this if a swing trade doesnt hit. Do NOT play Jan 15th to save money on shorter calls. 

-Last year in the same Dec to Feb time period it gained **8 dollars**. This environment of undriven cars and a light winter (with less drivers getting stuck everywhere) has potential to crush that gain. 

Good luck, you fucking trash bags.

Title: AJRD 55c dirt cheap
With Lockheed buying them out they are paying anyone holding the stock 51(share price)+5(in dividend) when merger is complete. Looking at the lower strike values and the 55 call for 1/15, it is insanely cheap. The Greeks looking nice, and it might be the lowest IV any of you fucks have ever seen. Worth buying a few. Plus its a rocket company so how can it go tits up?!

Title: Opendoor FV at $44.78 
Opendoor ($OPEN) Fair Value its at $44.78, according to popular valuation metric of EV/Sales. If you look at forward Sales, Zillow is supposed to make $4.79B. If we take enterprise value of $30B we get a ratio of ($30B/$4.79.5B) 6.26. Opendoor is supposed to make $3.5B in 2021 ([Slide 39](https://www.opendoor.com/w/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Opendoor-overview-investor-presentation.pdf)).

Opendoors Marketcap = $27.55 \* 544.423 million shares outstanding (Shares + Warrants) \~ $15B  
Through the Pipe (private investments), Warrants and Exhibit 99 to the SEC filing on Dec. 18, Opendoor has $1.25 billion in net cash. ==&gt; EV = $15B - 1.5B = $13.5B

If we apply Zillows forward EV/Sales ratio, 6.26 \* $3.5B = $21.29B.

==&gt; 166% undervalued. Fair Value for $OPEN in comparison to $Z, even neglecting higher growth multiples, would be $44.78.

Looking to crowdsource a list of short candidates. I know, I know, this sub expects stonks to go up 20% per month for the next decade but some of us remember 2000 and well, this feels like bigger version of the 1999 bubble.

Title: VIACOMCBS INVESTOR DAY
If you saw the Disney Investor day in early December you know it was a monster success for the firm and the stock went up double digits. Overall its been a strong trade. I see the same thing happening early this year with ViacomCBS as they relaunch their SVOD service with paramount plus / CBS all access. This product already has about 10M paying subs and the rebrand will include a ton of new content including a major documentary on the making of the god father.

 I expect the investor day for VIAC that CEO Bob Bakish spoke of at the recent UBS investors event for the telecom media Space is going to play out similarly to Disney in 2019 and 2020. Massive upside on the new streaming service.

plus I love PLUTO TV as a business and investment to drive growth. WTF is fast ok so this is really cool and the future of linear TV or traditional TV.The service (Free Ad Supported Streaming TV) is a type of product and Pluto was acquired by viacom in 2019 for peanuts. The most recent quarter showed the revenue doubled for Pluto and they launched a showtime channel to drive subs to showtime. Pluto is great for monetizing library content. Example there is a this old house channel, a MTV cribs channel a few comedy channels with Comedy Central stand up and shows and a Dora the explorer channel. Also a channel that plays James Bond movies 24/7. Essentially fast is free streaming paid for by ads. No box or subscription just turn it on. I love it for selling other shows like narcos just dropped a channel and Netflix can make money on their old show without a Netflix sub sold. Same for old titles from everyone in Hollywood. 

Remember these people own Showtime, CBS, Nickelodeon, BET, Paramount, 49 % of Miramax, Comedy Central, MTV, VH1, 50% of the CW, and multiple international channels like 10 in Australia or 5 in the Uk. 

The library is really powerful and overall they have the production capacity to rival anyone. I expect the firm will still produce for others like NFLX and AMZN. 

Showtime is also a great brand and with the collapse of creativity and thought at HBO I like it even more for edgy drama and comedy. HBO was once the leader in top shelf content but they are going main stream and poorly executed. Showtime will become a bigger brand and this becomes a sum of all parts massive streaming play. 

Im long DIS I think its the best streaming play but VIAC is for sure # 2 with their brands, strategy and execution so far Im even more bullish. I think everyone should look at this trade hard because it could be a massive play given the investor event in early 21 paramount plus rebrand and the existing valuation is ridiculously low. The future is streaming and these guys have been doing it for 6 years now all while making a profit. 

 check it out for yourself but Im going balls to the walls deep on this play. Also I like VIAC over VIACA for a lot of reasons including red stone family control. 

Happy hunting

Title: BABA Oversold, Dont sell out of fear
If your someone thats holds stock or options 3+ months out, dont sell today out of panic. Lots of people are panic selling and also selling for end of year tax losses. This will rebound after the holidays. Alibaba is chinas golden child, the entire world looks at Alibaba when it comes to China big tech and lots of Chinese people have pensions in the stock. 

Essentially the dust will settle and Alibaba has said that they will comply with whatever the Chinese Govt wants, which is essentially to allow their sellers to sell on other platforms as well. This will not impact their bottom line going forward and their Q4 earnings are gonna be fantastic. 

Im personally buying more stock and holding my April $265 options I bought a few weeks ago. Options are down 65% but not worried. At $265 this company was undervalued but at $225 this is like giving free money away. Lots of institutions own BABA and are literally gonna take your shares/options for free if you sell.

If your a weekly call holder your fucked but I understand thats the way if an autist. Other than that, enjoy your holidays and come back in a few weeks once the dust settles.

Title: Steel stocks confirmation
This isnt true DD, it is more me relaying the conversation I had with a good buddy of mine. This buddy of mine owns and runs his own fabrication shop. Thats a big word for you retards, it basically means steel. He was talking about how the price of his steel has almost doubled in the past two months, and there was one size he was straight up unable to get for a month or two. 

This isnt just a meme. This is actually happening. Talk to anyone in the industry. 

$MT and $VALE to the moon 

Title: FSLR will Outshine its Peers into 2021
First Solar (FSLR) will continue to rip into the foreseeable future and is the best short-term option play for solar energy. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Macro Backdrop**

The Federal Reserve's accommodative interest rate policy and massive QE programs have fueled investor appetite for long duration cash flows. Corresponding speculative activity is already seen in several parts of the market. The EV space is probably the best example of this today, and many of its first derivatives have had absurd runs this year. Blink Charging and QuantumScape come to mind. 

It seems that multiple expansion in the EV space has already begun to decelerate, and I expect it to continue while first/second derivative companies that rely similarly on long duration cash flows to thrive. Solar energy is a second derivative of a sort for EVs and itself has an incredibly large TAM. 

**Political Backdrop**

It's no secret that the Biden administration has emphasized renewable energy, and investors have noticed with solar etf TAN up nearly 3x YTD. There are wide ranging beliefs on how exactly the new administration will invest in renewables, but at the moment ignorance is bliss for investors (and autists like me who refuse to buy calls more than a month out). As long as Powell continues serving his QE party juice and the Biden administration focuses on renewables, I think the solar parties on until Biden's inauguration or until he takes a hard policy stance upon which investors might sell the news. 

**Undervalued Compared to Peers**

**F****SLR Forward P/E - 30x**

Run Forward P/E - 135.82x

ENPH Forward P/E - 99x

SEDG Forward P/E - 72x

SPWR Forward P/E - 71x

**Relatively Low Implied Vol = Cheap Calls = Big Tendies**

ATM 1/15 FSLR implied vol is 55% vs. SPWR (96%), ENPH (72%), JKS (110%). If the entire solar sector is going to rally up to Biden's inauguration, cheap FSLR calls would pay bigly.

**Final Thoughts**

I'm not a huge believer in technical analysis, but FSLR just broke out of a near decade-long trading range. Reaching Obama-era levels of speculation at $290/share would be a lot, but given its relative valuation, First Solar has a lot of catching up to do. With extreme macro/political tailwinds, First Solar will outshine its peers in an already hot sector.

**TLDR:** Buy FSLR calls because of political and macro tailwinds and relative valuation.

Positions: FSLR 1/15 120c, FSLR 1/15 130c

Title: $MT - Update #3 and why it will 
Fresh off another two day ban, Im back to share some IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS.

First though, a couple of things:

1.  I joined Reddit two years ago, because someone suggested I look at something on there, havent used it until recently when my son rushed me to start posting because I helped a lot of people on the way down and on the way back up make $. 

2.  Ive been in the steel business for 25 years and own my own company with sales and operations throughout US, Canada and Mexico. I no longer handle the day to day, but am still President.  Im also helping an EV company I invested in procure steel from my many contacts I have bought from and made over 25 years in the business. I also have some Dominos pizza franchises. I can tell you when to short them and Papa Johns. It all has to do with the price of clock cheese on the CME. If it eclipses $3.00 - it starts being an unprofitable business. That almost happened in June of this year when it hit $2.89/lb. 

To whomever the asshats are that think Im a MM/hedge fund - you should keep crawling down that rabbit hole you fucking retard. 

Look, this is my take and Im deep into it - Im cutting purchases orders daily for wire rod and steel plate for our manufacturing in Monterrey, Mexico with $MT and none of the purchase orders have prices on them. They are merely place holders in line and that line has now stretched until June. The orders will be placed at price time of shipment.

THIS DID NOT EVEN HAPPEN IN 2008. 

As for $MT, yes they are different company than in 2008 when two companies combined to form $MT a couple years prior. 

They have spent the past 14 years getting rid of the dead weight and older, non-strategic facilities and investing in smarter, value-added ones. 

It is all going to pay off - and I believe NOW is the time. 

I also buy a lot of steel from US domestic suppliers and they are facing a scrap increase that we have NEVER seen. 

Shredded steel scrap - the main ingredient in US steel making jumped three times this past month for a total increase of $135/ton. 

This is UNPRECEDENTED and will be passed on 100% to customers in the for of new orders. 

This is what I got yesterday from someone inside one of the largest steel mills in the US:

Says scrap will be up $70/ton in January.
 
Look for another $3.00/cwt + increase
 
They also went up immediately the full increase on new orders for 20 rebar
 
Scrap brokers are short shipping to domestic millshe said if a mill buys 10K tons of scrap , they receive 7K ton. This is putting a strain on their supply.

Strain on supply = less supply finished goods = demand very high = MUCH MUCH higher prices. 

THIS IS A GLOBAL situation. 

So much in fact, China decided to pass this, which came across last night from one of my brokers in Tokyo:

MEIS2020: China's next move on steel scrap imports will move global markets, Turkey panelists say
China resuming steel scrap imports in 2021 will directly affect global steel markets because of supply shortages, speakers on the Turkey panel at Fastmarkets' recent Middle East Iron and Steel virtual conference said. 
China will end the ban on imports of ferrous scrap on January 1 after it  reclassified certain qualities steelmaking raw materials under the new regulations.  
On December 23, China's Ministry of Finance also announced the country will remove its 2% import tax rate on ferrous scrap and revive its most-favored-nation duty rate system from January 1. 
Grkem Bolaca, managing director at international trading firm Galex Steel International, expects China to start importing about 15-20 million tonnes of scrap in 2021. 
Turkey imported 18,856,851 tonnes of steel scrap in 2019, according to the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK). This figure made Turkey the biggest scrap importer in the world last year. 
Globally, about 100 million tonnes of scrap is traded every year, and China's expected import volumes will have a direct affect on global steel production, conference delegates heard. 
Didem Taskiran, sales manager at Turkish steelmaker olakoglu, said the impact of China's decision has already been observed in the steel sector. Scrap prices have increased sharply since the beginning of November, when rumors of the imminent new regulation started to be heard. 
Fastmarkets' daily index for steel scrap, HMS 1&amp;2 (80:20 mix), North Europe origin, cfr Turkey was calculated at $462.78 per tonne on December 22, up nearly 50% from $308.60 per tonne on November 17.  
"We expect scrap prices to go up further," Taskiran said, adding that Chinese demand for scrap will mostly be for shredded and bonus scrap. 
"We [as Turkish steel producers] are importing a lot, and local scrap supply is not enough for local production.
Chinese imports will affect the prices on an upward trend. Unlike flat steel, long steel prices are directly affected by scrap costs.
In addition, if China starts importing scrap, they will be ready to pay any price," she said. 
"We expect China to start importing scrap in June," Taskiran added. 
In the wider context of the steel scrap market, availability of steel scrap is limited. 
Russia's Ministry of Economic Development has approved an amendment to its export duty on ferrous scrap to raise the minimum duty to ?45 per tonne to combat the threat of a shortage of steelmaking raw materials in the domestic market. The duty is expected to be imposed in early 2021, according to a source close to the matter. 
Ersun zdemirel, strategy and marketing manager at Turkish flats re-roller and coated steel producer Borcelik, said decisions to switch to electric arc furnace production, which uses scrap as a feedstock, rather than blast furnaces could be driven by environmental concerns. 
The European Commission is reviewing European Union rules on waste shipments to encourage more recycling within the EU and is exploring ways to reduce the exports of such materials. 
"The European Union especially is working to reduce carbon emissions and in mid-2021 they will announce Green Deal regulations. If they apply the carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), EAF production will be advantageous and we will see demand for scrap increase," zdemirel said. 
"In the future, scrap might be scarce and much more valuable," he forecasted. 
Europe and the United States have a 80% share in Turkey's scrap imports. The country also uses hot briquetted iron for steel production, mainly imported from Libya and Russia.

Ok, so we already have an iron ore shortage and prices at ATH. 

Now, China is targeting steel scrap because they cant get enough raw material to take care of their own infrastructure needs. 

This will MOVE THE GLOBAL markets as it says above. 

How does $MT fit in - its simple they will be selling product at much higher prices with higher revenues = higher margins = higher EPS. 

For you fucking retards simple math:

If you normally sell a product at $600/ton and your margin is 20% - you are making $150/ton. 

With increases you sell the same product for $1000/ton and your margin is 20% (maybe more for an integrated manufacturer like $MT) your margin is $250 per ton. 

You have increased sales and revenue by by 66% on the same business EVEN if your business volume stays flat - which it isnt. 

Their business is growing and their PT has been increased by Goldmans, Jeffries and KeyBanc. 

I got banned for posting the KeyBanc increase. 

Anyhow - make your own decisions. 

If you dont want to buy $MT - dont. 

Good luck to the believers!

Title: $BFT (FoleyTrasimene II), SPAC to become Paysafe
 I think that this one has been under-reported somewhat but since I work in the online gaming industry, it showed up on my radar.

This SPAC has reached a deal to bring back Paysafe to the market, at a valuation of 9 billions.

**What is Paysafe?**

Paysafe Group has been consolidating the market for e-wallets and alternative payment methods for years and went back into private hands 3 years ago.

They regroup all the main e-wallets used for online gambling and Forex: Skrill and Neteller and also prepaid cards (to be bought in 7/11 and the like) under the Paysafe brand.

**Why e-wallets matter in the online gambling market?**

E-wallets and prepaid cards represent about 25% of the volume of payments in online gambling in UK, Europe, Canada and Skrill/Neteller/Paysafe are by far the biggest names in this field.

[https://www.fisglobal.com/-/media/fisglobal/WorldPay/Docs/Miscellaneous/Gaming%20Payments%20Report%202019](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/%22)

Neteller and Moneybookers (as Skrill was known then) were dominating the US alternative payment methods gambling market in the US before they got pushed out in 2007. They still have high name recognition amongst the gambling crowd and web searches in the US for these brands remain high, even if they cant process much transactions there for gambling since many states dont have online gambling legislations yet, or very limiting ones.

E-Wallets are often the preferred payment method for gamblers since it allows to move money from one operator site to the other quickly and cheaply. They can also use it as a bankroll segregated from their main bank account/CC and on top of that, Paysafe offers loyalty benefits to users based on their transaction volumes. As such, their user retention is very good.

The prepaid card business is also a major factor for this stock attractiveness. Prepaid cards to be bought in gas stations or the like are often preferred by gamblers who want to strictly control their gambling or those who dont have access to a CC (maybe because they gambled too much) or those that prefer cash transactions out of privacy concerns

**Why not invest in the gambling operators instead?**

Operators such as Draftkings or legacy casino groups are going to make money but the regulatory environment is harsh and gambling taxes are crazy in some states and might keep going higher.

Moreover, the regulations being so fragmented, many smaller operators push in certain states and not others and the competitive environment is broad. Remember that gambling is a fungible good. There is no difference in the casino games that the operators can offer (same game studios, same rules) and aside from bonuses and the margins on sports bets, the only differentiation is in branding, which is a thin moat on a product that often leaves the users disgruntled (losers).

Payments on the other hand are not taxed for their relationship to gambling and there are far fewer players.

**How does Paysafe make money?**

The margins on their products are pretty high and Paysafe charges both sides of the transaction in the case of the e-wallets and the merchant side in the case of the prepaid cards.

For the use of Skrill and Neteller wallets, Paysafe charges on average 4.5% on the merchant side for deposits and a whooping 9.9% on deposits with prepaid cards Larger merchants certainly can negotiate these rates down but this is still a healthy fee, much higher than credit card processors.

In markets where Paysafe has established domination they charge a small deposit fee to the user and a withdrawal fee.

For now, they charge no fees to the US users in a bid to grow market share surely but that will probably end some day.

**Growth opportunity:**

For now, the US online gambling market is still very limited. Most states have not legalized, the majority of those who have legalized only did so for sports betting and then a handful have legalized online casino gaming (where the real money is made). The opening up of the market is bound to grow as states need money and more of the world moves online.

It is estimated that the online gaming market could reach 25 billions a year in the US in a few years time and 150 billions worldwide.

[https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/online-gambling-market#:\~:text=The%20North%20America%20online%20gambling,CAGR%20during%20the%20forecast%20period](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/%22).

[https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-online-gambling-market](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/%22)

These revenues do not equal to deposited amounts, they equal net deposits (deposits minus withdrawals). The hold % of online casinos can be anywhere between 50% and 80% depending on how degenerate the market is in a given country but we can conservatively assume 60%.

This means that deposits volume in the US alone would reach about 40 billions, Europe about 50 Billions and worldwide 250 billions.

That should give Paysafe around 8-10 billions in transaction volume per year in the US alone , another 10-12 billions in Europe and conservatively, another 20 billions worldwide.

**Valuation estimates:**

Rough estimates are therefore revenues of about 1.5 billions per year for Paysafe group in a few years for gambling alone.

Paysafe claims 1.5 billions in revenues total projected for 2021, with only a third from gambling.

Even assuming no growth from the other verticals, this means that the total revenues of Paysafe should grow by 66% with gambling alone in the next 5 years or so.

Pysafe is investing a lot into expansion in other areas than gambling, notably video-gaming and remittance so assuming they dont fuck it up completely, we are likely to see a 3 billions dollar in revenues in the next 5 years.

Using Paypals marketcap vs revenues, that would mean 50 billions in marketcap for Paysafe Of course, Paypal is ingrained deeply in the whole of ecommerce and Paysafe is more specialized in gambling which might be shakier and herefore command a lower valuation.

The deal details are not fully known but it looks like a current valuation of 9 billions for Paysafe Group upon listing. 

Based on my estimates, the marketcap could reach 50 billions in a few years time, one US market for gambling fully opens. 

$BFT is trading at a 25% premium right now, therefore the estimate is 4x on investment over a few years.

Obviously you retards are not the most patient bunch but I believe the stock will jump when it morphs and so keep an eye out for the options.

Title: Merry Christmas, here's my DD on BABA
News broke yesterday that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) formally started an antitrust investigation of Alibaba. The stock plummeted by more than 7% in after and pre-market trading. This is the latest development in the ongoing story of a deterioration in relations between Alibaba and the CCP following Jack Ma's harsh criticisms of China's financial regulators on stage at a Shanghai conference in October.

Read on for an analysis of the relationship between CCP and Alibaba and whether BABA is a buy, hold, or sell after this news.

# What exactly happened?

China's State Administration for Market Regulation released a [very brief statement](http://www.samr.gov.cn/xw/zj/202012/t20201224_324638.html) declaring that it has begun an antitrust investigation of Alibaba over suspected monopolistic conduct including the "picking one from two", or "" policy. This policy forces online merchants to sell exclusively on one platform and is actually widespread in China's ecommerce market.

Alibaba responded publicly with an equally brief and terse statement.

&gt;"Today, Alibaba Group has received notification from the State Administration for Market Regulation that an investigation has been initiated into the Company pursuant to the Anti-Monopoly Law. Alibaba will actively cooperate with the regulators on the investigation".

# Analysis

There are three scenarios that can play out, ranging from mild, moderate, to severe. The following is a high level summary of each with a conclusion on what I believe is the most plausible outcome.

## Mild

The CCP is simply seeking to teach Jack Ma a lesson in humility. The antitrust investigation results in minor changes to the regulatory oversight of Alibaba and perhaps even a small fine. Jack Ma falls back in line and business as usual ensues.

This outcome implies buying BABA on this dip.

## Moderate

To preserve it's own interests and validity, the CCP is seeking to make a strong example out of Jack Ma and his companies. This is just the start of a long string of bad news between the CCP and Alibaba to inflict maximum pain on Jack Ma. A potential outcome for Alibaba could be heavy fines and heavy regulatory oversight that effectively sacrifices Alibaba in favor of more obedient domestic firms.

This outcome implies selling BABA and trimming exposure to other Chinese companies until new information emerges suggesting that relations are improving.

## Severe

The CCP pulls the plug on the Variable Interest Entity (VIE) structure that allows Alibaba and other Chinese companies to list in the US. In a VIE, the Chinese company sets up intermediate companies registered outside of China, thus outside of the CCP's jurisdiction. These companies own X% of the Chinese company and has a contractual obligation to X% of the company's profits but not the company nor its assets. These offshore intermediate companies then list on US exchanges and effectively give US investors ownership of the company (but not really, just the company's profits). For Alibaba, its intermediate offshore company is domiciled in the Cayman Islands.

VIEs are a legal grey area under Chinese law. In 2015, the CCP drafted legislation banning them but didn't follow through. In 2019, they approved legislation with an updated definition of what is considered foreign investment that conveniently doesn't mention VIEs. This was interpreted as an implicit approval. Why wouldn't China approve of VIEs given that they are a significant source of foreign direct investment in Chinese companies? However, not mentioning VIEs also keeps the CCP's options open to pull the plug whenever.

As it pertains to the current spat between Alibaba and the CCP, a possible outcome is the CCP banning VIEs and effectively ending foreign ownership of domestic companies. All Chinese companies listed in the US would have to be delisted.

## What's the most plausible outcome?

To the market, given everything that is known, the most plausible outcome is the Moderate case. This is as much because of the information at hand as well as the lack of information. What we know so far is that relations between Jack Ma and the CCP have deterioriated. What we don't know is how severe the deterioration is and how much pain does the CCP want to indirectly (and perhaps directly) inflict on Jack Ma through his corporate empire. So far, there is no indication that the CCP is getting off the case of Jack Ma and this presents significant risks for institutional investors. To make matters worse, the CCP acts on the behest of a single person, Xi Jinping, and a single person's opinions and actions are much more volatile than a commitee's. This only adds to the uncertainty of the present situation. What do institutional investors do in the face of uncertainty? They sell for safer bets.

A common argument against the Moderate case is that China is unwilling to hurt its geopolitical crown jewel. Alibaba is a key piece in China's strategy to satiate its hefty appetite for global soft power and the CCP hurting Alibaba beyond any surface wounds only hurts itself. The fall of BABA collapses the credibility of Chinese companies internationally and reduces foreign direct investment in China. On the surface, this argument holds weight but there are several holes. First and foremost, as much as the CCP desires to project global soft power, its number one priority is maintaining domestic power and legitimacy. There is little information on how much of a threat Xi perceives Jack Ma to be and again, this lack of clarity by itself gives weight to the Moderate case as far as market sentiment is concerned. Secondly, Alibaba is not the only Chinese multinational company that can continue to increase China's soft power projection. Tencent is a peer to Alibaba in terms of market capitalization and international influence and don't forget there are many other smaller companies waiting in the wings. As such, it's unlikely that market sentiment will veer towards the Mild case over the Moderate case.

Finally, the market doesn't believe in the Severe case. VIEs have been significantly beneficial to the CCP in terms of foreign direct investments and soft power projection. Banning VIEs will destroy the CCP's credibility and hurt international investments in China for years to come.

# The BABA action plan

BABA is a sell in the short term until the uncertainty begins to clear. Institutional investors will be trimming their positions and selling as soon as they can. Although there will be a segment of retail investors trying to catch a falling knife, their buying volume will be dwarfed by the rest of the market's selling. In addition, BABA's fall coincides with the year-end tax-loss harvesting period where investors sell underperforming assets to reduce the next year's tax burden which is even more impetus for selling. In terms of price action, BABA will probably consolidate after the massive drop overnight. There will be a short term relief bounce during this consolidation so selling the top of this bounce is ideal. After consolidation, if the situation doesn't change, it'll form a descending price channel to a prior support level (e.g. $200).

In the long term, I believe that BABA will do well and long positions should be established the moment clarity starts to form and BABA has consolidated at a lower support. I personally believe that the CCP isn't interested in significantly hurting Alibaba and is really targeting Jack Ma. Given that Jack Ma has given up the reigns of the company, the CCP has little to gain from inflicting more than surface wounds on Alibaba. As always, personal beliefs should be separated from overall market sentiment.

I share my thoughts in this blog: [FinanceTLDR - Alibaba is being investigated by the CCP. Buy, hold or sell?](https://www.financetldr.com/posts/alibaba-is-being-investigated-by-the-ccp-buy-hold-or-sell)

Title: A battery play for you EV freaks (ABML)
Hey y'all just wanted to stop on by to recommend one of the sexiest stocks I've seen in a hot sec. This stock alone has perpetuated my portfolio over 400% gains and it shows little sign of pulling back.

ABML is ran by ex tesla engineers and they have an excellent business model. They plan to recycle lithium and are currently in the mining business. They just purchased the land for their factory of which is mysteriously close to tesla's gigafactory . They plan to start construction in the spring and they have open communication giving updates at least monthly. https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4395892-american-battery-metals-less-of-miner-permitting-play

Disclaimer: this stock is traded on the OTC market so most of you fucks can't even buy in. Schwab is recommended for $0 fees for otc trades also there are no options :(

Positions: ABML shares (.09 avg)

Title: NKLA is fucked. Lion Electric to potentially gain the contracts and if so the MOON is waiting for us
So this is a lot of speculation but [Refuse Services announced yesterday that the deal for NKLA's 2500 refuse truck order is now off](https://www.wastedive.com/news/republic-services-nikola-electric-refuse-truck-waste-recycling/582647/) (since its all obviously a scam) 

However as the article states they really want to get their refuse trucks and believe that EV refuse trucks are the future (for NA) 

Why Lion? they have been promoting their [EV refuse truck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsNQwjXDP4&amp;t=2s&amp;ab_channel=LionElectric) heavily and mentioned on multiple interviews that **they plan to dominate the refuse truck market.** Their **first waste trucks are being shipped in Q1 2021 (soon).** 

Now if you look at the same article, **Republic Services mentions Lion Electric as potential candidate** for the waste trucks even when they had plans with NKLA: 

 *&lt;&lt; Mack,Peterbilt, BYD, and* ***Lion Electric*** *are among other notable names pursuing their own electric refuse models.Applications are on the road or on the way in multiple states, including among municipalities and companies such as Recology, Waste Connections, and Waste Management. &gt;&gt;.* 

Looking at **Lion Electric's investor presentation they mention having a contract of up to 2500 trucks** but cannot disclose who yet. This is the same 2500 as NKLA orders. So is it possible that now that the NKLA deal is officially off, Lion is getting the deal and will soon release the news? 

Who knows but this is one of the many catalysts that could send Lion to the moon. 

TLDR: NKLA dead, Lion electric stealing the tendies and leaving them on your from door. Launch mission could be soon.

Title: AZN about to breakout to the upside
AstraZeneca is another pharmaceutical company hedge funds are piling money into. At only 128 million in market cap with a ton of growth potential, a PE below 20, and a nice dividend at 2.8% this is a great stock to long. 

But that's not why were here. Look at the charts. This has hit a bottom and is crossing over on the 4 hour charts. If this closes above $49 today it will have confirmed the bottom and it will be time to pile in with monthly call options. I've already loaded up. The daily charts look way over sold and ready for a bounce. This stock is going to hit $53 in the next couple weeks.

Title: Recent IPO comparisons with OPEN (ABNB, AI, PLTR)
# Theory

I'm trying to form a theory around how OPEN should behave in the coming weeks, and so I looked at recent IPOs to see how they fared. My three comparables  ABNB, AI, PLTR.

|      | Initial Dip | Next 5 Days |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| ABNB |     -13.76% |     +30.76% |
| AI   |     -21.26% |     +73.99% |
| PLTR |       -9.7% |      +9.52% |
|      |      -14.9% |     +38.09% |
|      |             |             |
| OPEN |     -11.05% |           X |

If follow the average performance of those companies, we get +38% over next 5 days for a price target of $38.67. Insane, right? But happened to those stocks, so definitely worth revisiting this on 12/31.

Title: Reinfection Is Common - Implying Anti-body Half Life Is Short And B Cell Immunity Is Fleeting (DD)
**Preamble: Reinfections are common given the opportunity. Reinfections can be used to estimate anti-body half life for anti-bodies created by the vaccine. Reinfections can also be used as an indicator for B cell immunity, as B cell immunity created via a infection is the same as B cell immunity created by a vaccine. Yes, vaccines do provide a greater initial antibody count than a natural infection, but the anti-body half life is the same and short as indicated by reinfections. Bi-annual vaccine boosters are not logistically feasible.**

You can estimate antibody half life from how often people are getting reinfected. The antibodies created by the vaccine decay at the same rate. [[0]](https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/antibody+half-life)

All other immune responses induced by the vaccine after the initial antibody boost are the same as after a natural infection. [[1]](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html)

If bi-annual vaccine doses are needed, its a problem. Its not possible to distribute twice a year

Title: $BABA DD on the anti-trust probe
 So I've been seeing a lot of posts/comments on different subs lately from new investors who are scared and are thinking of selling their BABA shares first thing tomorrow. If you are uncomfortable holding this company given the recent news, and understandably so, then go ahead - this post is not for you. It's your money, do whatever you want. But I want to make this post for the new investors who are in between/scared because they have a big position in this stock and are not sure what to do.

Full disclaimer: Alibaba is my second biggest position and constitutes almost 8% of my portfolio. I have been holding this stock for a very long time and my cost basis is somewhere in the low 100s. Even I will be buying into this dip tomorrow. Let's break down some of the reasons and different scenarios:

1. CCP (Chinese Communist Party) has bad blood with Jack Ma, not Alibaba. Yes Jack Ma was the founder and he still owns massive portions of the company, including portions of subsidiaries of this company, but he is no longer the CEO. If the government took some action against Jack Ma, it would not fundamentally hurt Alibaba as a whole. Let's remember, Alibaba is one of China's tech darlings. The government and their people take pride in Alibaba being one of the biggest companies in the world. CCP cares very deeply about the global image of China. They would not do anything drastic to the company that would ruin it's image or ruin the image of it's largest technology company
2. Alibaba is facing anti-trust probes due to forcing sellers to do a pick one strategy. Right now, if vendors chose to sell on Alibaba's marketplace, they cannot sell on JD or Pinduoduo. Yes, the CCP can overturn this, and this is most likely what will happen. However, is this enough to justify the 5-10% sell-off that is coming tomorrow? Absolutely not. In fact, Alibaba trades at a 20x PE while Amazon trades at a PE above 100x. The company is already undervalued as of right now IMO.
3. Alibaba may be forced to pay a fine to CCP: This changes absolutely nothing fundamental about the company. Alibaba is sitting on millions in cash and they generate insane levels of cash flow every quarter. Even a large fine would not hurt this company
4. Alibaba may have to hand over some shares and ownership to CCP: This changes nothing about the company. Let's remember, the CCP essentially controls all businesses in China anyways. In particular, the CCP has always worked closely with Alibaba and Tencent anyways.
5. Stricter regulations on Alibaba and Ant Group. This will likely happen. However, the company has already said it is willing to work with the CCP and regulators to come to an agreement.
6. Worst case scenario: Alibaba gets broken up. Bad for Jack Ma, bad for Alibaba but GREAT for investors. If each of the parts of Alibaba were released separately into the market, Alibaba would be worth way more than what it is today. (The conglomerate discount: It's a thing, search it up)

In short, this anti-trust probe is likely just a small hiccup if you are a long term investor. CCP is most likely doing this just to remind Jack Ma and others that they are still the boss and that talking against Xi is a very bad idea, even if you are one of the richest man in the world. That is all.

Title: Sales Tax Software Avalara and Vertex
What is the solution to the following issueHow do states cover the budget gap caused by the coronavirus? We know the following:
-New York State faces a $14B -$50B revenue shortfall vs. spending. 
-Other coastal/Democratic-leaning states face similarly-massive budget shortfalls.
-American unemployment is at all time highs
-States cannot enter into a fiscal deficit under their State constitutions. 

(a) billionaires charitably save our ass
(b) we raise income taxes
(c) we raise sales taws. 

All answers are ridiculous but (c) is the winner. The cost of PP&amp;E, trial vaccines, and budget shortfalls can be passed on through charging online vendors to U.S. and state-specific customers sales tax. As a matter of fact, Wayfair v. South Dakota mandates that out of state sellers with over 100k of revenue and some-off transactions in a state collect and remit sales tax in a state even though they have no physical presence therein. Over 40 states have a similar rule to South Dakota requiring these out of state sellers to collect and remit sales tax in the state based purely on economic activity. 

-its popular because its not an income tax
-it removed an out of state sellers benefit vs. those in state. 
-little by little; we the cost of covid 19 to all states is passed to American citizens vs. big-time donors. 

All is well except its a pain for the sellers. How do they track customer location and whether they trigger a collection and remittance requirement? They but Avalara or Vertex Inc. software. Not because they want to, but bc they have to.

Today, I am here to share my next DD. And unlike my other DDs, this is a bit speculative.

TLDR: If Apple is building EVs, MGA is likely the manufacturer based on their past partnership and the fact that Apple likes to outsource manufacturing.

**So, what the hell is Magna?**

Today, let me tell you about this sleeping giant called MGA. Few years back (circa 2014-2016), when people first started hearing about Project Titan, aka Apple EV project, MGA was in talks to manufacture Apple EVs for Apple. Dozens of Magnas engineers were working with Apple to develop Apples new baby. 

For those who are not familiar with Magna, the company is considered as the worlds biggest contract manufacturer for cars. (Think FoxConn for iPhones or Taiwan Semiconductor for chips)    A big part of their business is to help automakers to manufacture their vehicles when these automakers lack the resources (i.e. factories) or time to build the cars themselves. For OEM automakers, their current and past customers include big names like BMW, Volkswagen and Aston Martin.

[Check out Bloombergs feature on MGA back in 2016](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-magna-international/)

**Ok. So they are like FoxConn to Taiwan Semiconductor, but for manufacturing cars. So why are they not   if they are in bed with Apple?**

Well, Apples Project Titan went through a lot of changes since 2016. It struggled with direction, leadership and technical challenges. the guy who lead the project, Bob Mansfield, left the company and then was brought back. They laid off a lot of people from the project and then retooled the scope of the project with focus on autonomous driving and a new battery technology. During this time, their previous deal with Magna also died out.

But now the project is back on track with a rumor to launch as early as 2024. Recently, various companies started mooning based on pure speculation that Apple might be using their parts for the project. (I.e. LIDAR)

However, theres not much talk about who would build the cars. Well, Apple normally designs the product, but outsources the manufacturing. Considering that other EV manufacturers needed to build their own factories in various parts of the world, Apple would need to do the same. However, their business model would suggest that they would outsource the manufacturing and since MGA was once a partner for Project Titan, it is reasonable to think that Apple will choose MGA for future manufacturing as well. Eventually, news will reach the public but in absence of any news that Apple is making capital investment to build its own auto manufacturing factory, it would likely tap a third party like MGA because Apple lacks the expertise to manufacture cars themselves.

**Ok, But what if MGA is not picked by Apple? What then?**

Well, you ungrateful bastard. Ive already told you that this DD is a bit different and its more speculative than the others. 

Considering that MGA is the leader in this field, and Apple tapped them before, two things are clear. One, Apple showed their hand that they intend to outsource the manufacturing in the past. Two, MGA has the relationship and familiarity with the Apple Project. 

But Magna has other trump cards in its deck. One, Fisher tapped MGA to build their electric SUVs and the production is expected to begin in 2022. As part of this deal, MGA received 6% of Fisher stock warrants so you know this relationship is going to be a long term partnership.

Secondly, LG Electronics formed a joint venture with MGA to develop EV power trains and other EV parts. LG works with General Motors and Jaguar, so this joint venture can potentially lead to deals with those automakers and it positioned MGA further as a leader in this field of car manufacturing.

Finally, even though they are strengthening their position in EV manufacturing, their bread and butter is their existing contracts with companies like Ford, GM, Toyota, VW and BMW. In China, MGA has even inked a deal to build entire electric cars for BAIC Group, as many as 180,000 cars annually with the first batch of cars arriving now.

**Recommendation**

Right now the stock is trading around $70~ per share with market cap of only $22 Billion. 

Over the next 12 - 24 months, EVs continue to be a hot topic. As more and more people convert to EVs, more EV stocks will moon and MGA will benefit from that conversion. But, if and when Apple confirms MGA as their manufacturer as they disclose more info about their EV between now and 2024, this stock will   beyond your dreams. My prediction? $100 by Summer 2021. $140+ by year end 2021.

Title: BABA and Chinese Antimonopoly
Back with some more news, I told yall one month ago there was the possibility of serious headline risk with BABA. There was a bounce, but now new news has caused the stock to break levels post ANT IPO. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jnycsf/baba\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jnycsf/baba_analysis/)

https://preview.redd.it/v287u7wcv1761.png?width=589&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=169c7f7f6a1b5e784c4c1c9593882d8bec1891fe

About two hours ago, this was posted on Xinhua News Agency, which is the official press agency of the CCP.

https://preview.redd.it/yyak0y8iv1761.png?width=959&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=449bcb97b74925ed5dc13e87b91730fb78949114

It reads, the state administration for market regulation in accordance with reports, has created an investigation into Alibaba group for monopolistic practices. What for? They forced sellers on Tmall to "two choose one", which means signing agreements to not list, primarily on JD, and other sites. In response to accusations of this practice last year, Alibaba was quoted saying that this practice is normal market behavior, the survival of the fittest.

 

The platforms are not tycoons, and cost does come from the wind. There is a natural lack of resources during sales, so we can only devote ourselves towards the brands and sellers that are most loyal to us, this is the simplest of market principles.

Also, I heard that Alibaba tried to offer a stake to the Chinese government for the ANT IPO and they still got fucked nonetheless.

The Chinese government, like the US, has been lenient toward its own monopolies but the party has always had a tighter grasp on its companies as opposed to Washington. The revival of anti-monopoly legislation is a serious threat to the bull cases for market leaders.

The best Chinese stocks, in general, are tanking in HK today, but competitors to BABA will bounce soon.

Title: Why GME could squeeze as early as tomorrow
Came across noise that GME has been on the reg sho threshold list for almost 13 consecutive trading days so I  decided to do some digging and boy did I find something interesting. So interesting that I dare predict a short squeeze could happen as early as tomorrow. The magnitude of the squeeze is something that will be hard to tell, and could be dependent on factors currently unknown to us, but it will definitely be an early christmas present for many. 

**What does it mean to be listed on the threshold list and what happens on the 13th consecutive day?**

The Regulation SHO Threshold Security List was created by the SEC in 2005 to reduce naked short selling. Stocks appear on this list when at least 0.5% of shares outstanding failed to be settled for 5 consecutive days or more. If a stock is on the list for 13 consecutive trading days, participants will be forced to close any settlement failures (a.k.a cover the naked shorts).

**Is GME on the threshold list?**

You bet. 12 consecutive trading days starting from 8th December 2020. Quick maths mean the 13th consecutive day would fall on 24th December 2020. Shorts will be forced to cover tomorrow basically.

https://preview.redd.it/wm6n09bbs1761.png?width=1145&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=552c76e3fdf51d81989e7021f53316385030a4ad

**Has this happened before?**

Yes. 12 consecutive days starting from 22 September 2020. Quick maths mean the 13th consecutive day fell on 8th October 2020. 

https://preview.redd.it/6r3d53lvs1761.png?width=1111&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a9f42ae5235bbee1b1044b42f8ce5fa6a0f382d

Guess what happened on the 8th October 2020? 

[Price shot up by 41.4&amp;#37; with a staggering volume of 76 million shares](https://preview.redd.it/kktrcq0pt1761.png?width=669&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d85baa22a8b5666de0e888355c90b8ce02c466f1)

**So there will be squeeze tomorrow? By how much?**

I am not a prophet but I am confident a squeeze will happen tomorrow. How much would be up to your own conclusion. All I can say is that back in October, almost everyone and their wives' boyfriend were bearish on GME other than the few OGs we have here. Ryan Cohen only had a 9% stake, GME gang and their theories were laughed off. Shorts were able to cover and close their naked shorts stealthily and without much trouble. 

This time round, Cohen upped his stake to 13%. WSB Capital has entered the foray with approximately 5% stake, which will probably be watered down to 2.5% of diamond hands stake.  Senvest Management has entered with a 5% stake as well. Hedgeye with 90k twitter followers sets a PT of $50 for GME. Some big player has been buying lots of GME shares for the past 2 days. 30M and 25M volume respectively. There are still 68M shares short at the moment. The market closes early tomorrow at 1pm. Shorts will have to buy a shitload amount of shares in half a trading day. Don't forget, GME is attracting a lot of attention from FOMOs and boomers with the Hedgeye tweet. Shorts will have to compete with all these buyers to cover. True available float should be much lower this time round with more big players in, and retail investors knowing about the potential short squeeze, and most importantly pure autistic energy. 

TLDR: All in GME. Set sell limit at $420.69.

Title: PSTH Long Play. Low Risk, Big Gains
#Disclaimer

This play may take several months to play out. So if you want returns fast close this out and hit up your favorite Wendy's Dumpster. Also ignore all the Stripe tinfoil shit from November. No one knows who the target is or if there is one except Pershing and the target.

PSTH jumped today for no reason so wait for it to cool back down to 25 to get the numbers I am throwing around.

#The play

Sell bull put spreads on PSTH close to NAV. The 20/22.5p spread for June is trading between 1.4 and 1.7. With a 1.4 fill that puts your breakeven at 21.10. I anticipate PSTH to run up before the next Pershing Square quarterly update. I cannot find a date but I suspect late January. Buy back your contracts during the meeting runup and resell after the drop. If Ackman releases a LOI specifying a SPAC target buy to close your position and go balls deep in long dated calls. The LOI pop should remove at least 50% of the value of your spreads. A side benefit is the put spread gives you a hedge to sell calls against your PSTH shares and still buy the calls back should there be an LOI before your sold calls expire. The acquision target really shouldn't matter. Even if we are eating fresh (Subway joke for you Gen Zer's) the target is a solid business it will run.

#Downsides

The spread is wide and volume is low for June. Fucking abysmal. Just set your order and forget it. I initiated my position when the mid was 1.75. It kept dropping as I lowered my bid but PSTH market price remained the same (algo working me?) and I finally got fills at 1.4 on 12/18. So I sold 100 contracts for a 14k credit. This is a great play to sell on your margin, especially if PSTH is your collateral. This keeps diversification low WSB style and with 100 contracts your portfolio moves $1000 for every $0.10 the spread changes. Pack pepto until closer to expiry or turn your app off.

#Sidenote

The mid on the June 20p is around 1. This is free money if you want to sell puts. Wait until the "OptIOns Are GamBliNg" crowd at r/investing finds out about low risk 10% yearly positions and comes in to chide us.

#Risks

* Ackman says the n word
* The new NYSE DPO rules which allow for capital raising attract Bill's targets and PSTH just fades. After the new rules were published this week there was no drop in PSTH. Bullish
* No target and the money goes back to holders and you, the contract seller hit max loss (just kidding you sold 2021 contracts, right?)

#Upsides

* With SPACs general market sentiment should not tank PSTH below 22.5
* You can play PSTH with margin and this is super low risk. Some of the big boys got in at 23 (citation needed)
* Here are the big players trusting Bill with their money: https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/psth/institutional-holdings
* The redemption value of this spac is 20 which really means the 20p you're buying for the spread is just buying you more margin

#PSTH details if you've been living in a cave

Bill Ackman launched this SPAC over the summer with investor and target friendly terms unlike pretty much all other SPACs. Giant market cap and he only wants a 10% stake in a unicorn. Lots of rumors and tinfoil hat as to the targets. Nothing substantial as of yet. Ackman said Pershing was still on track for a Q1 2021 merger in November. Search WSB for PSTH or head over to r/PSTH. r/PSTH has gone down hill since the Stripe pump in November.

#My Positions

PSTH shares and warrants. Sold 20/22.5 put spreads for June. Sold Jan 30c on my shares and will buyback if LOI lands before then.

#TLDR

TLDR: sell tight PSTH put spreads close to NAV

Title: GME DD Fresh Perspectives Pt 2. Gamestop vs Amazon
Todays DD is what I wanted to start out with. I know yesterdays DD was boring but I just had to start by laying the foundation to establish *GMEs bare minimum growth case (if I were to put a number, a low double digit growth yoy, which in todays world is just a survival case)* ***in the gaming industry******.*** This is their baseline. This is their foundation. 

Today, Im framing a bull case I havent seen others lay out the blueprint for. I hope you guys can all picture it. I am willing to bet this is at least some of what Cohen sees in Gamestop. If I were Cohen, Id be all over Gamestop too. Disclaimer: I am in e-commerce myself and Im in a niche within consumer electronics. I make a comfortable living making more than most professionals do. Remember, all of this is on TOP of their baseline growth. 

Back in September, Cohen said long term, he wanted to make Gamestop a true competitor to Amazon (source A). No article in September specified  the gaming industry. To be honest, I feel that only got added in November because to be frank, no one saw it. Everyone laughed. 1:1 competitor? Im not so sure about this one. I believe in you Ryan, but this might take some time.  
   Co-existing among eBay ($35B), BestBuy ($26.5B), Amazon in the next 2\~3 years? 100% Doable. Being #2 amongst those names? Definitely achievable and the setup is too perfect to ignore. 

**Gamestop vs Amazon. Advantage Gamestop has on Amazon**

 Gamestop has a location in every urban center. Even after closing 1000 locations that are losing money most likely due to them being in a mall, they still have 4000 locations. Its time to think of them as 4000 distribution points/fulfillment centers and NOT brick and mortar stores. Amazon has 175 warehouses worldwide. 

 They can deliver an item A LOT faster than Amazon or anyone else can. Almost as fast as you can get pizza/food delivery if you are in a major city. 

 instant delivery via Doordash (piloting, but no problems yet). For the generation that want everything right now, this is great

 They are already set up to take trade-ins of consumer electronics and already have a reputation for it.

 Direct to consumer = no middle man = greater connection with consumers as well as greater profit.

 When it comes to new items, its safe to say that Gamestop has buying power advantage over almost all, if not ALL eBay/Amazon sellers.

 By not having a huge warehouse and carrying 12 million SKUs, their operation is much more efficient. Consumer electronics with the exception of television, are all very compact. (Its not a loss though a TV is not a hot item people replace every couple of years). 

**Now here is where it's gonna get sweet.**

**Ever watch Forrest Gump? Cohen spots Forrest Gamestop sprinting through the field in a true autist form, but he sees the potential in him, as the fastest receiver of tendies.**

 Consumer electronics is one of the most popular and one of the most profitable categories in ecommerce. Think drones, phones, computers, tablets, gaming consoles, VR etc.

 When it comes to used consumer electronics, the profit margin is actually bigger. In major cities, even as a nobody, it is not difficult to make $100 flipping devices, and flip 20 devices/week. This is how I got started so I know firsthand.

 It also comprises the most commonly bought and sold items on local classifieds such as Craigslist, Kijiji, and Facebook marketplace. 

 Currently the only business with a global presence to facilitate buying/selling them used is eBay. 

**Where eBay &amp; others fail/their MAJOR drawbacks when it comes to used. Remember, this is the ONLY names in the game.**

 Long shipping times and many inconveniences to put up with to get the product

 Inconsistency.

 Risk of fraud or at the very least, risk of time being wasted leading to frustration. 

Do you see it now? Gamestop is a unicorn hybrid in the marketplace filling the gap between Amazon and eBay, in the most profitable and most category in ecommerce as well as offline, with faster delivery, and you can bet your ass that with Cohen running it, better customer experience. 

**But cmon dude. With a name like Gamestop? How do you think they can establish this in peoples hearts and minds as the consumer electronics shop?** 

How about this name? PowerUp, now it makes sense, right? 

They already have 55M PowerUp members, compared to 165M Amazon Prime members, its not a lot. At the same time, its not little, but GME has also created a revolving door by giving them more in store credit than cash for their trade ins. 

**Valuation**

Unless all shorts are underwater at $16.00 right? Let me use $16.00 as an example, because it will NEVER fall below it now. Meaning? shorts will eventually close. 

That puts the market cap at $1,1B. Amongst 4000 stores. $276,000/store. Try setting up a store in locations Gamestop is set up at, with inventory and trained staff for $276,000.

Its not possible. You would probably spend that on set up/reno and inventory alone and thats not even including the brand presence thats already built into peoples hearts and minds for buying and selling used consumer electronics.

Yeah but the valuation is low because theyre losing money! Without any of the things I mentioned today materializing, theyre going to be posting positive profit moving forward for sure after closing 1000 losing stores and focussing on e-commerce. 

Guess what though? Gamestop is already slowly gearing towards what I laid out. Check out their website. Drones, tablets, VR, phones, consoles, used games, computers. 

ALL of what I laid out today, is ON TOP of the gaming foundation I laid out yesterday.  ****  ****  **** 

**Squeeze valuation** 

$103 MINIMUM  ****  ****  **** $326 Maximum before coming back down to $40. Timeline 1\~4 months. I will talk about the squeeze valuation tomorrow. Theres a major positive I havent seen others mention.

Ask yourself, have you 4xd your money in the past 1\~4 months?  **** 

**Position**

Shares as well as options JAN 15 15C, 30C, APR 16 30C. GME makes majority of my port.

Title: Eidos Therapeutics (EIDX), BridgeBio (BBIO) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK): the Devil's Threesome
Eidos Therapeutics (EIDX - mkcap 4.95B) is in late stage clinical trials for a promising drug (acoramidis) for transthyretin amyloidosis cardiomyopathy which has a potential market of loads of $$$. BridgeBio (BBIO - mkcap 8.48B) an incubator for biotech startups - they provide resources (lab space, HR stuff, shared personnel for stuff like IT/bioinformatics) in exchange for equity. (mkcaps as of today's close)


Going back to 2019, BBIO has been building up to control 60% of EIDX shares. In early October, BBIO made its takeover official and proposed to buy EIDX outright for $73.26 in cash per share or 1.85 shares of BBIO (valuing EIDX at about 2.85B). BBIO's stake in EIDX makes this all but a done deal, to be completed in 1Q 2021. As a longtime shareholder of EIDX, the 40% rocket on Oct 5 was beautiful - EIDX closed at $73.51 per share and BBIO closed at $39.77 per share (which those especially autistic of you may notice means these two tickers are trading at the expected 1.85 ratio) and I thought that was a nice run I had with EIDX.


For the next month or some BBIO and EIDX pretty much traded flat. Then around mid-November, there were rumblings that a bigger fish was interested in EIDX. There was a steady influx of investments into EIDX since about November 11th. By early December it was revealed that GlaxoSmithKline (GSK - mkcap 90.9B) was that bigger fish and GSK had proposed to buy EIDX outright for $120 per share (valuing EIDX at ~4.6B). GSK has also indicated a **willingness to go higher than that offer**. 


In December, there has been steady and continuous pressure driving the price of EIDX up (up 37% this month). But because of the BBIO offer of 1.85 shares per owed share of EIDX, BBIO's share price has also been locked in with EIDX. (See today where EIDX closed at $127.36 and BBIO closed at $69.09 - autist vision = 1.84). BBIO essentially has control over the merger because of BBIO's considerable stake in EIDX. However, now there are lawsuits because the GSK offer is $120 per share compared to the BBIO offer of $73.26 per share and raises some questions about what BBIO is purposing. 


Thesis: it's GSK that's slowly and consistently driving up the price of EIDX (and thus BBIO), while at the same time *someone (GSK?)* has built a put position in BBIO because anything that disrupts the BBIO acquisition of EIDX is going to hurt BBIO more than EIDX . **Look at the May 21, 2021 puts for BBIO - over 1000 options for 35p - this is over half of all the current put options outstanding for BBIO - someone is taking a huge bet against BBIO before May 2021.** If any traction is gained on the lawsuits, this could bust down the BBIO stock price, while not affecting the EIDX price (because of the high bid on the table from GSK). All this should come to a head around mid-January, but I wouldn't be surprised to see EIDX hit $150. Counterpoint: why are there not more higher value puts against BBIO? 


Downsides: these are smallcap biotech stocks with relatively low volumes especially because of the merger/acquisition talk and very limited options markets (though the limited options markets highlights the usually bet against BBIO)

Which was outlining what had caught my eye with the share stats (fourth paragraph down), amongst other really positive news.




I had no actual price target until I saw the seeking alpha article. I knew things were looking good from the recent deals and watching the order book for the past week, but this was all the confirmation bias I needed.




I get $15/share by taking the $9/share mentioned in the seeking alpha article, multiplying by 2, and subtracting $3. Easy maths

Title: US spending bill creates first Uranium Reserve 
Listen up real close because you'll need to drool between the lines on this one.

The spending bill that's going to pass is creating a $75 million US Uranium Reserve to secure US supplies of Uranium and make us less reliant on foreign sources. This all follows the green energy hype train that if you're not on yet wtf are doing.

US based Uranium miners are hot and will be well into a Biden adminstration. The largest domestic miner of Uranium is small and shall not be named for fear of ban but look around in this space to find big memes.

Title: $LMND DD
**Alright retards**, PLTR is sick and all but its not exactly mooning.  Heres a stock that is mooning and I predict will continue to for a long time.

Lemonade $LMND is a disruptive insurance company.  Thats it.  Truth is, I doubt anyone here knows much about the insurance industry but you dont really have to.  These guys are attracting loads of young people, are changing the way insurance companies are viewed (from evil to good) and are using technology to make the whole process cheap and easy.

**$LMND:**  The stock has more than doubled in the last month and its market cap currently sits at $7 billion.  Think thats a lot?  [Think again](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/111314/top-10-insurance-companies-metrics.asp).  This is insurance were talking about people.  

State Farm market cap:  $64.4 Billion.

Allstate:  $30.6 Billion.

Berkshire Hathaway: &gt;$300 Billion.

**Lemonade could be more worth all of these companies combined.**  Thats what disruptors do.  Tesla is now worth more than many other car companies combined because they disrupted the fuck out them.  Dont be a gay bear and bet against a disruptor.

**Growth:**  [In force premium doubled year-on-year, while gross profit increased 83%, adjusted gross profit grew 138%, and net loss - per dollar of gross earned premium - halved.](https://s24.q4cdn.com/139015699/files/doc_downloads/2020/11/Q3-2020-Shareholder-Letter.pdf)  YUGE.

**The CEOs:**  Daniel Schreiber and Shai Wininger, two extremely successful driven dudes.  Maybe youve heard of Fiverr, or should I say [$FVRR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/fvrr?ltr=1) which has absolutely fucking **mooned** this year.  Maybe these boys know a thing or two about starting a successful company?

**Total Addressable Market:** Insurance is a huge industry, 5 trillion dollars worldwide.  Right now all they do is pet, homeowners and renters insurance  But they currently have plans to expand to term life insurance (another huge market) and eventually car insurance.  They just released Lemonade in France too.  *Frappe mon cul et appelle-moi Nancy. Ils sont l'international.*

**Millenial/Gen Z appeal:**  People fucking hate insurance companies.  Any company that can change this relationship and gain market share will inevitably grow a lot.  These guys give some money to charities which makes young people pitch a tent.  Also their logo is sexy and pink which is sure to make everyone cream their jeans.  If their customers are creaming, investors are creaming.

70% OF THEIR CUSTOMERS ARE UNDER 35!!!  SMELL. THE. TENDIES.

**Customer Satisfaction:**  I'm not gonna lie, this piece is not my best DD right here, but if you go through the app store and look at different insurers reviews, they have the highest rating at 4.9 stars.  FUCK IT.  That's a good sign.

I am sick and tired of you clutching your PLTR calls hoping that the stock will moon.  Stop posting memes about that curly haired data cuck.  Yeah that thing will probably keep going up, but the hype is gone and r/wsb looks like it got whipped in the balls.  Lemonade is barely on people's radar.  No gay bears in sight.  Want to make real money?  Stop being a fucking cuck and posting memes all day about that Alex Karp dweeb.

Title: $ShitFix ($SFIX) is going down the crapper
TLDR: 

ShitFix is about to have a red candle so extreme it will be called the devil's dildo.  Give your self a christmas present and get in on the drop. 

Positions:  $70 dec 31 poots. (some this week too). 

why? 

**News**

Demand for Fixes (when a stylist chooses some clothes to send to a customer) is so low that there is no work for stylists. A source who works there (let's call her SnitchFix), says that Stylists are literally being told to do the minimum hours they can because there is not enough work to go round.

# Insider Sales

No one in the company believes in this thing. Theyre selling it as fast as they can

Amazon has introduced Prime Wardrobe, a personal fashion shopper service for $4.99/month, slightly more than Stitch Fix's $49 annual style pass. Here's an article on yesterday's Wall Street Journal on how Amazon steamrolls its rivals.  This is not good news for Stitch Fix. No wonder Katrina is selling

**Technicals** 

SFIX  went up 100% in 11 days (from $35 to $70) based on 10% increase in quarterly revenues. This was the short squeeze GME gang has been wet dreaming about. But it's over. 

the overall volume has declined, but short interest volume has increased (see below).  Too many traders and investors believe that [$SFIX](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/SFIX) went up too fast too quickly-- it is time for a reality check. When (and not if) one or more institutional shareholders decide to sell to cash in their yearly profits.

Title: XL Fleet to the moon Part 2 
I wonder how many of you retards jumped on the PIC bandwagon when I had first mentioned it at 12$ a share :
 https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k2r2xi/xl_fleet_to_the_moon/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Now it's crossing 30$  To anyone who did, today was your day! XL flew so high it got suspended twice by the SEC today! 

The ride isn't over yet though! This is the day our adversary short seller Shitron has finally joined our ranks against the mutual enemy of gay bears :

https://twitter.com/CitronResearch/status/1341816134635417600?s=20

This day will always be remembered as the day all of the retards who hold XL Fleet took their first step to unlimited tendies in Valhalla! 

P.S : Still holding my calls and shares, sitting on 400% profits. Not selling till it's a 10 bagger! Price target : 100$

Title: Stop holding your bags, most stocks historically always drop on Christmas Eve. Sell now and hide or buy puts for tomorrow.
People on here are excited by several stocks rocketing for various reasons, usually stocks that shouldn't with some exceptions, and many of you believe that you can keep holding instead of taking profits but there's a problem:

***Christmas Eve.***

***Historically almost every listed stock (not OTC) drops on Christmas eve***,  and the few that are up are always gambles most would never expect to be up due to recent history, bad news, or other negative reasons.

And those of you who have longer options or shares thinking that you can take the hit and hold past are in for a painful ride. Most stocks even with good news crash on Christmas eve or start trashing, and the next couple months or more, depending on the security, it'll crash until it reaches it's stagnant point and will basically stay in that price range unless something causes the stock to break out. 

This leaves many shareholders taking massive losses and seeing not much movement for months or more depending on the stock/etf, and Option holders almost never outlast this stagnation before expiration.

***This has been the case every Christmas Eve since 1981*** with one exception and that was due to an unusual injection into the markets in the late 80's.

So the bottom line is, unless you want to gamble on which stocks are going to shoot up tomorrow or after tomorrow, which is likely NOT any of the stocks you are holding or are keeping track of...

You should sell your calls or all/portion of your shares now, or close to closing if you think there's more room to run in the next hour and a half.

And then just wait until things are clearer later on, or buy puts for option holders and get those drop gains. But then expect many stalks to be in limbo in the same prie ranges for quite some time.

***IF YOU ignore this warning*** you will be selling nothing, or hopelessly left with the bag one day hoping the stock goes back to that 2020 high that will never come again in all likely hood. Or worse, you are an options player and you aren't holding anything, the bag disintegrates in your hands like dust.

&amp;#x200B;

**DD summary:** Sell now before Xmas eve, nearly all stocks crash on Xmas eve, and spend weeks-months-years in stagnation on the same price ranges depending on stocks. Sell all/most shares and leave for some time. Option players buy Puts, ignoring will leave you expired or holding a bag that will never fill up to the current 2020 highs today.

Don't let the excitement of seeing days of rising value you make you a sucker and lose your gains, get out by 4:50 today at latest.

Title: This market has taught me that a much simpler strategy is needed
Let me start by saying this:
Research into company fundamentals, balance sheet, executives and future goals and buying the stock will almost guaranteed lead to appreciation in value. This post isnt to take it away from that.

But Ive been having much more success by taking myself almost fully out of the details and looking at companys from a birds eye view. Holding stocks or calls (that are out at least 3 months)

My current portfolio 
Safe bets (this is where I re invest all of my options gains, this is all of the research Ive done)
Disney  amazing scope in industry, theme parks, streaming, movies, and brand name
Sony  absolutely monster of a balance sheet. Dominant in consoles.
Activision  one of the only gaming companies that push out thrilling and popular games

Also hold Amazon stocks but thats through RSUs.

My options bets
AES  energy stock, renewable energy. Im Betting on a big contract or for it to gain traction on any news of government giving preferential treatment. 
2/19/2021 13 27C

CCL  Carnival. They almost guaranteed are planning worst and best scenario in order to prep themselves for the 2021 season. A company this size will not allow itself to be turned to dust even for a global pandemic, something will be done and Im betting on that.
4/16/2021 3 27.5C

XOM  monster of a balance sheet as well with focus on renewable energy. Oil will not go away in the next 5 years and they are known more of an energy stock nowadays rather than just oil.
7/16/2021 2 50C

BP  same as above
1/21/2022 4 30C

ATT  truly a gamble to see what will happen. Price has been depressed and with the amount of brand and exposure and customer base they have I do think they may make a comeback
1/21/2022 6 35C

Ford  betting on their new electric vehicles and the possibility of landing good contracts selling batteries. Also like their CEO, much more forward thinking. 
1/21/2022 7 15C

Nokia  Full gamble here as well. They have good engineers and they have good programmers. They have the experience and they still have the name that people remember. Betting on a full reinvention of themselves, they also got a new Chief Strategy officer that Ive no idea who is but hoping here they made a decent choice and he starts taking risks

1/20/23 18 7C

Veritone and Plug  just a couple hundred shares each IV is too high for the risk for me. Already made about a grand each but Ive literally done no research on it but just overview stuff. Will probably offload in Jan or Feb when hype dies down

This is an absolute trash DD and its not PLTR, GME or TSLA so Ill take all the downvotes :)

Title: Next Major Catayst for Weed Stocks
Alrighty ladies and gentlemen. I think we have a fucking amazing opportunity in front of us here today. "What's that?" you might ask. I'm talking about the potential marijuana boom following a Democratic Takeover of the Senate, which is very much in the realm of possibility.

We currently stand at 50-48, Republican Seats/Democratic Seats in the Senate; Democrats already have control of the House. The last 2 seats will be determined in the GA Senate Runoff Election, and boy is it close. A few weeks ago it seemed as if Republicans had it in the bag, but as of recent, polls are showing Democrats taking a slight lead. With a lot of early votes being cast, and turnout numbers similar to the presidential race, I really think Kamala Harris has a chance to be the Majority Leader of the Senate.

So what does this mean for the marijuana industry? It means bills will be able to hit the floor and get voted on, something that Mitch McConnell has blocked since retaking control as the Majority Whip in 2015. This in turn means reform, as the Biden administration has vowed to make changes: decriminalization, legalization, banking, etc. There are huge barriers restricting the growth of MJ in the largest MJ market in the world. A Democratic Senate would unleash the dogs, open the floodgates; whatever idiom you prefer, its will be BIIIIIIIG. And in my opinion, this event is not yet priced into the market. I think the run-up to this event will start soon, so if you're interested in profiting from it, then rev up your engines because its going to be a wild, volatile ride; high risk-high reward.

In terms of positions, I really like TLRY, MSOS and IIPR.

For TLRY, the recent merger with APHA will peg the company at around a $3b valuation, about 1/3 of the valuation of CGC. Once merged, the new company will be the largest company by revenue in the world (won't last long but still significant revenue for a global company) and headquartered in the US; they already have operations there (Manitoba Harvest, a hemp-foods company, and SweetWater Brewing Co, a terpene infused craft beer maker.) They now have top branded MJ products from APHA's portfolio in the Canadian market. TLRY also has a partnership with Budweiser to make CBD infused beverages; a partnership with Sandoz (an arm of Novartis, a major pharmaceutical company) to support the commercialization of non-smokeable, non-combustible cannabis products; a partnership with Authentic Brands Group to market and distribute cannabis products (if unfamiliar with these guys just do a quick Google search to see who they work with: celebrities like Shaq, companies like Forever 21. Blackrock holds a minority stake, NBD); contract with the DEA (one of few) to study medical marijuana at UC San Diego; access and partnerships in the EU, particularly Poland (where their major grow-op is located), Israel, Germany, and Italy; multiple clinical trials set-up globally to study cannabis. To get more info on all this you can look at investor presentations from the past including their newest one, post-merger. These guys are a big deal.

There's a lot of chatter and negativity about these guys, understandably so. They burn through cash like no ones business, they're still not profitable and people don't like that their Executives sell shares hand over fist, amongst other things. Because of the negativity surrounding these issues they have relatively some of the highest short interest amongst major MJ companies so it's very volatile. I personally feel that TLRY has been beaten down to hard considering all it's done so far. They are the first movers, pioneers or trailblazers in a huge industry, and one thing I know for sure, as I worked in the industry once upon a time, that major investors want to see companies making moves, and TLRY is doing just that: MAKING MOVES.

They have a low share float as well and when these shares pop, they pop. Just take a look at the charts and see for yourself how the stock moves. Most recently the presidential election sent TLRY soaring along with the likes of many other MJ names. TLRY saw some of the biggest gains of them all. I remember seeing someone post of WSB that they put $150 down on Nov 6 weeklies on Wednesday Nov 4. When they cashed out that Friday do you know how much that measly fucking $150 was worth? Over $10k!!! Are you fucking kidding me!? I follow this industry like a crazy person and I haven't ever had a win that big. FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE! JK but not really... congrats...? kinda... whatever, fuck you.

I could say more about TLRY but I'd probably burn you all out, if I haven't already. So I'll move onto MSOS real quick which is the first ETF of its kind, listed on the NYSE with exposure to American Multi-State Operators. Nuff said.

Now for the hedge: IIPR. You might be saying to yourself, "This dude is retarded. How can IIPR, another MJ company, be a fucking hedge to the MJ play on the GA Senate Runoff results? Go read about what an actual hedge is dumbass! You don't know poop from applesauce!" But please let me explain first before you "professional" traders get your man thongs up in a bunch. IIPR is running strong and has been for good reason. It's an REIT specifically for the US Medical-MJ industry. The use capital "to acquire income producing real estate" and their "sale-leaseback and other real estate solutions offer an attractive alternative to state-licensed medical-cannabis operators who have limited access to traditional financing themselves." In other words, without access to banking partnerships with major financial institutions, which is prohibited by federal law (and banks abide by it because they'll lose access to government subsidies), MSOS's have seemingly nothing else to turn to for financing besides IIPR if they want to grow and scale their operations across the US.

So bringing it all together here's how I see this playing out. TLRY and MSOS benefit from a Democratic takeover of the Senate and we could see instant price appreciation given the future revision of federal US MJ laws, and in context of this DD, access to future banking partnerships and being able to potentially receive cheap loans like every other legal industry, through the passage of the SAFE Act. If Republicans maintain control, I believe these names will be negatively affected (the risk therein.) Right now TLRY is still in buying range even as it rises today while I write this article, most recently bouncing off support. MSOS is coming off ATH's so use TA to find a good entry; I'd recommend scaling in and cost-averaging if you're an eager beaver. (Just a note on TLRY, my #1 play: today someone bought $11 Feb Calls and $15 March Calls for a total of around $350k in premium and at the time was worth about $5m in stock at that price. I don't think anyone is betting that they're about to waste $350k in premium on options contracts... just saying. My lucky ass happened to be averaging down on those March calls by the end of last week and the beginning of this week. Booyah!)

I'm still trying to determine how IIPR will play out in this scenario but I truly think that a Democratic Takeover of the Senate would have a negative affect on its stock price near term as it becomes more obsolete, but not totally (plus its coming off ATH's so its hard to say where it finds its next level of support, which I think it could settle around the $180 mark; time will tell.) IIPR will still be a viable investment as it is very profitable, increases its dividend QoQ, and is growing fast. Plus these laws will take some time to be passed and implemented in this scenario, but remember the market is a future value pricing mechanism. It wouldn't surprise me though to even see it rise as it's still an MJ stock. In the case of Republicans maintaining control of the Senate, I see IIPR being a benefactor here given its current function, but coming off ATH's I think we need to see more consolidation for a more favorable entry point but still a good play none-the-less.

There you go everyone, take it as you wish. The information is there for you all to dominate on. I have about 30% of my portfolio on TLRY calls which is small potatoes but I'm holding these bad boys for a big payday. Still scoping a position in MSOS and IIPR. Good luck ya'll and happy investing. Let me know if there's any questions and I would love to hear your feedback!

Title: My analysis on why GameStop will beat Amazon. The answer - Microsoft GPUs.
Im a software engineer. Im new to trading and slowly learning how to buy stocks and options. I want to share my thoughts on the technology side of things.

I think the comparison between GameStop and Blockbuster is both right and wrong. Its right when talking about brick &amp; mortar business losing to digital, but wrong in comparing movies to games. They are completely separate technologies.

Movies are pre-rendered and ran on the CPU. Games are rendered in real-time on the GPU. In other words, movies are in the business of CPUs while games are in the business of GPUs. This is why gaming is so important to Nvidia and AMD. 

I believe that Blockbuster failed because they didnt realize they were actually in the CPU business. How did Netflix defeat Blockbuster? They bought a ton of CPUs from Amazon and ran movies on them. With that CPU power they destroyed Blockbuster and became the de facto for movies. 

With Microsoft partnering with GameStop means $GME will get Azure GPUs for cheap. Which means POWER! 

I believe we are seeing the start of a proxy war between the cloud providers namely Amazon CPUs (Prime Video &amp; Netflix) vs Microsoft GPUs (xCloud and GameStop).

I am a long term bull on $GME. 
To the moon! 

POWER TO THE PLAYERS! 


Title: Amyris, Inc to $15/share 
Positions: 400 shares @ $5.50. A handful of $6c 6/18/2021

Amyris, Inc. recently won the 2020 Best of Whats New award from popular science for their PureCane product. Its a sweetener derived from sugarcane through a patented process. See more information here:

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/purecane-revolutionary-sweetener-derived-sugarcane-140000757.html

This is one of many catalyst that will continue to push this upwards as news spreads. This isnt a new meme company so its under the radar, but look at another positive catalyst here:

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amyris-closes-50-million-strategic-130000911.html

Yeah thats a 50m deal with 30 of it payable by 12/30/2020, and this is only one of MULTIPLE transactions in the near future. Also, while I was looking at the share statistics which are quite interesting, I came across this article:

https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4395271-amyris-is-setting-up-for-monster-run

Which was outlining what had caught my eye with the share stats (fourth paragraph down), amongst other really positive news.

I had no actual price target until I saw the seeking alpha article. I knew things were looking good from the recent deals and watching the order book for the past week, but this was all the confirmation bias I needed.

I get $15/share by taking the $9/share mentioned in the seeking alpha article, multiplying by 2, and subtracting $3. Easy maths

Title: PSTH  Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd  The "Once More Unto The Breach" DD
 **$PSTH  Activist investor Bill Ackmans Gigantic SPAC  Updated DD**  

I last wrote on PSTH roughly 30 days ago and at the time the SPAC was getting very little press attention at all. Ackman announced the SPAC in the spring of 2020 and it started trading in July at an NAV of $20. Ackman has steadily collected an impressive investor list, filled with long term and reputable investors.

Since then and since my last post a lot has happened. This DD serves to provide an update and recap for those new to the stock and considering a play here.

**TLDR;**

PSTH is a gigantic SPAC with a reputable CEO and the most impressive investor list ever created. The company is on record for a Q1 announcement and is targeting a mature unicorn. At an NAV of $20, the downside risk is capped significantly while the upside potential is very high depending on target.

**Background information and recent events**

 In July 2020, Bill Ackman went live with SPAC $PSTH  the SPAC raised $5B in proceeds with the option to take it to $7B (leveraging funds from PSCM, Ackmans hedge fund) making it the biggest SPAC ever created.

 In multiple interviews following the SPACs debut, Ackman has been clear about several things:

o He is hunting for a mature unicorn

o He has stipulated a predictable business is most ideal with steady cash flow or guarantees along the lines of predictable growth

o This means large cap, well run, asset light, family owned, high moat, company

o He has a buying power of approximately $7B dollars at present and is hoping to capture a minority stake of between 15-20% of a large enterprise. This means a valuation in the ballpark of $40B.

o He has delivered on developing an incredibly impressive list of investors thus far

o **Investors in the SPAC so far include:** 

 Baupost Group (headed by Seth Klarman, $30B hedge fund manager, the next Buffet and noted value investor) = $450M position

 Guggenheim Capital = $560M position

 Ontario Teachers Pension Plan = $290M position

 Soroban Capital = $290M position

 Wells Fargo = $290M position

 Kevin Sharktank OLeary = undisclosed position to be reported in Q1

 Warren Buffets position remains speculative. He recently left his JPM position and is secretly adding to a big position (pushing the filing deadline requirements as he does whenever he builds a big position as to not cause an overprice of the stock before he finishes buying). There is also a large undisclosed position in PSTH held by someone from Q3. This remains completely speculative and it may not be Buffet but another large stakeholder or pension fund.

 KEY Point: \*\*No other big banks have secured big positions in PSTH\*\*

o The investor list above is just a sample of the top holders. Each of these positions were made at the end of Q3 of this year. The stock has risen $2 or 10% of NAV since this time (not much considering the size and runway ahead).

**PSTH SPAC Design**

 PSTH is called a SPAC, but as others have pointed out, it does not resemble any other SPAC, in size or design. Some details:

 PSTH incentivizes long-term holding and only dramatic upward shifts in the stock price through its unique tontine structure. Upon purchase of one common share and holding of that share through announcement and merger, owners receive 2/9 of a warrant with a strike of $23. Those who buy and sell on announcement bounce therefore give up that 2/9 and it goes back into the pool for those who hold through merger. What a lot of people are missing is what this means. It means that the ceiling for the value of that fractional warrant is unknown but at minimum is 2/9. If there was a minority sell off on announcement that 2/9 could increase to 3/9 or 4/9 warrant for those who stay in. This creates a wild incentive for long-term holding of the company and is referenced in the "tontine" name - look it up, pretty cool.

**Targets**

Much speculation exists online as to what companies Ackman is targeting. Here are some key points:

 Earlier in the year he commented publicly on Air B&amp;B, Stripe and Bloomberg. He praised all three companies publicly.

 Since that interview, Air B&amp;B has gone public via IPO and notably lost out on $3.8B during the valuation process and IPO

 Stripe has generated intense interest online. Despite the hype, the Collison brothers (head of Stripe) have publicly commented via tweet that no such deal had been struck after a WSB twitter account congratulated the brothers in a silly way. Despite this, many (including me) believe that Stripe is still very much in play and that some of this is a negotiation tactic. When questioned on Stripe, Ackman was gracious but said that the company was not ready to go public, citing managerial and personnel deficits only. In the immediate aftermath of that comment (literally the next week), Stripe went on an insane hiring spree specific to Public Managerial positions. This has been documented extensively by u/YoloCapitalMgmt on twitter. Ackman is on record saying his biggest regret in investing was not getting in on MasterCard due to regulation uncertainty. He said the best investment you could ever make, assuming valuation made sense, was in a company that made royalties on others spending money. He has since commented that PSTH would very much be in favor of merging with a FINTECH. Big name FINTECH EXEC Jackie Reeses (former head of square) has been added to the board of PSTH, creating even more speculation around Stripe as a target).

 Bloomberg remains in play. There has been no definitive declination by Bloomberg and rumors in the past exist in both directions. Michael Bloomberg has both commented that he would not take the company public and that there could be interest in a minority stake being sold.

 Other potential targets that have been floated with little in the way of momentum include SpaceX, Fidelity, Inspire Brands and Subway.

**Target summary based on my view**

Targets in order of likelihood of Q1 merger announcement

1. Bloomberg

2. Stripe

3. Fidelity 

**Bill Ackman**

A few notes on the head of the SPAC, Ackman:

 A billionaire activist hedge fund manager with a highly interesting track record if youre interested in looking into it.

 He has had some misses in years gone by most notably Herbalife short (where he was correct but still lost money) and Valeant.

 In recent years he has mounted an insane comeback poster annualized return of 50 and 60%. 

 Some of his most iconic recent plays include Chipotle (take a look at that story) and Canadian Pacific

 Notably he shorted the market prior to COVID, correctly predicting a financial collapse. Through the use of CDS (made popular during the 2008 financial crisis, he turned a $27M insurance policy into a $2.6B trade in March of this year. He subsequently used the funds to advance positions in high quality companies he was a holder of (when these stocks were at their absolute lows in March).

**Some other notes**

This is a highly interesting play and to get in you are betting on Ackman and the impressive investor list he has obtained.

While this isnt objective financial advice, this play is incredibly enticing and one worth looking into

Title: MGNI overview and brief DD 
**TLDR:** 1/15 $40C if you're feeling risky. 3/19 $35 calls if not.

**What is Magnite and how does it make money?**

Magnite is a sell-side advertising platform (SSP) that aggregates advertising units (aside from GOOG, AMZN, and FB). This is an automated platform that takes these units from publishers across different media channels (e.g., mobile, tablets, Connected TVs, etc.) and then sells them to the buy-side (DSPs like TTD). Magnite makes money through a "take-rate" - essentially taking a cut from the publishers sales. That cut is somewhere in the realm of 8-14%

**Why Magnite over company xyz in this space?**

Magnite has big goals. The companies Telaria (leader in CTV) and Rubicon (leader elsewhere) merged in April to be the #1 player in this space. Think back to that management class you took sophomore year of college where they talked about the BCG growth-share matrix. Magnite is a star (or ), meaning it has a **high growth rate** (we'll get to that below) and **high share**

**Why will they keep going up?**

* The space Magnite plays in is HOT (30%+ CAGR). Linear TV (that $200/mo bill your grandma pays DirecTV) is dying, and streaming is taking over 
* Taking this further - Magnite stands to make money off of streaming content that has advertising (AVODs/FAST). The SVOD market (Netflix and co.) has matured, but ad-based content is just now taking off. Think players like PlutoTV, Xumo, Tubi (all acquired by huge players like CBS, Comcast, and Fox this year). It's the place to be, and Magnite is the winner because it can profit off of all of them
* So far, just a Disney+ relationship has been announced. **Expect more of those announcements** in the coming months.
* In terms of valuation, MGNI is only at a $3B market cap. TTD sits at $30B. 
   * MGNI's EV/rev is \~13, TTD's is 59

**Responses to common comments**

* "They're up 90% in a month, thanks for the late DD"
   * *Better late than never, this was on CNBC for the first time yesterday and the real pump is just beginning*
* "Needham has a $30 PT, which they've already blown by"
   * *Needham's PT is based on a DCF analysis. $30 is the bottom. Speculation will make this  *
* "You're an idiot"
   * *Ya*

**Positions**

* Safe play: Q4 earnings are expected mid-late February. Any March calls are a safe bet as even a dip will get eaten up and this will run up to a monster Q4 earnings report, given record CTV sales and everyone sitting at home watching the Mandalorian in Q4
   * 3/19 $35C
* WSB play: $40C options just opened up, buckle your seat belts
   * 1/15 $40C

Title: $SKLZ DD LETS GO BULL GANG
Courtesy of The Great Correction from Yahoo.

SKLZ family and future family...

I took some time and created an accurate DD resource for anyone new and curious about SKLZ and its prospects as an investment going forward. This should serve as a good jumping off point for anyone who wants to research further.

To the best of my knowledge, everything here is FACT and easily verifiable with a google search and/or listening to some of the recent interviews with the CEO, who by the way, is borderline giddy in some of them at the prospect of finally going public.

So without further ado... This is why I sincerely believe that being able to buy into this company at the current valuation is a VERY rare opportunity with huge long-term upside potential.

MARKET GROWTH&gt;&gt;&gt;

\-The mobile game market is currently experiencing explosive growth.

10 years ago it was an 8B market. Today it is 68B. In 2025 it is projected to be a 150B market.

\-Video games are rapidly becoming the leading form of entertainment.

\-Already more popular than books, movies and music, video games are on a path to even eclipse TV.

\-SKLZ DOES NOT CREATE GAMES. SKLZ provides a PLATFORM for game developers to monetize their creations through competition.

\-There are currently 10M game developers world-wide that are are looking for the best way to monetize.

\-Before SKLZ, game developers relied on advertising and in-app purchases to monetize their creations.

\-SKLZ has found that developers who monetize their games through competition (game-centric) instead of advertising are up to 5X More profitable.

\-SKLZ will run 2B (yes BILLION) tournaments in 2022.To put that in perspective, that's 1700 tournaments EVERY SECOND.

\-SKLZ user engagement (minutes a day spent gaming) trumps many other popular platforms.

SKLZ 62 minutesTikTok 52Facebook 41YouTube 40Snap 28Mobile Gaming Average 17

MARKET OPPORTUNITY&gt;&gt;&gt;

\-90% of SKLZ revenue comes from North America

\-TAM outside of North America is roughly 4X as large.

\-SKLZ currently has 2.7M monthly active users.

\-Total MAU world-wide is 2.7 Billion.

That mean currently SKLZ has only penetrated .1% (that's 1/10th of one percent) of the potential market. It's almost impossible to imagine a longer runway for potential growth.

MOAT&gt;&gt;&gt;

\-SKLZ Competitive moat is its Anti-cheat tech which involved years of data science development.

\-SKLZ measures 300 individual data points a minute during gameplay.

Think McAfee Anti-virus but specifically designed for competition-based games.

\-58 issued or pending PATENTS for this Anti-cheat technology.

INVESTORS&gt;&gt;&gt;

The people behind Flying Eagle Acquisition Corporation, the company that merged with SKLZ to take them public are the same people that took DKNG public through Diamond Eagle. Yes... These are the Exact Same Guys.

\-PIPE investors are of the highest quality.

\-Wellington, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Nueberger Berman.

\-Existing SKLZ stockholders and PIPE investors have agreed to a 24-month lock up period, a testament to all involved party's faith in the business.

\-SKLZ has been able to deliver incredibly consistant, predictable growth since 2017.

\-In 2017, SKLZ met with Flying Eagle (DKNG guys) and provided them with growth projections for 3 years out.

\-SKLZ has met its growth projections every quarter within 1%-5% since 2017.

\-SKLZ is expected to grow at 57% CAGR through 2022.

FINANCIALS 2020 Q#/YTD&gt;&gt;&gt;

\-Third Quarter Revenue of 60M, Up 92% YoY-Revenue YTD of 162M, up 91% Over Prior Year-Affirming Full Year Guidance of 255M

\-Gross Margins of 90%+-Long-term projected EBITDA of over 30%.

VALUATION DISPARITY&gt;&gt;&gt;

\-At $20, SKLZ is valued at Approximately 12X 2022 Revenue (P/S 12)

\-Currently SKLZ is valued at Roughly 24X 2020 Revenue (P/S of 24)

\-Unity Software, a company in a very similar space, is currently valued at 60X Revenue (P/S of 60)

CEO&gt;&gt;&gt;

\-SKLZ CEO Andrew Paradise is a Big-Idea kind of a guy.

\-He previously founded and sold his startup AisleBuyer, a company that let consumers check out in stores via their mobile phones, to intuit in 2012.

\-He is always talking about his company's "100-year vision". That vision- Creating the "competition layer" of the internet.

\-My favorite quote from him from a recent interview....

"What a lot of people don't understand about our business is that SKLZ is not so much a video game system as much as it is.... (wait for it...... ;) a DATA AND FINANCIAL PAYMENTS SYSTEM.

Aka... FINTECH.

Big things in the future here folks, short AND long-term.

As always... Good Luck!!!!

Title: the Yeezy of stocks
Look, we all have seen retards go for yeezys at resell value, spending hundreds of dollars on shoes that don't last 6 months. The hype is real when Kanye is involved. Look at Nike, when he was part of it, now Adidas and just look at the brand YEEZY becoming a billion dollar company. 

Kanye, THIS YEAR, announced a deal with GAP, instantly bringing the stock from 9 to 14$ a share (something like that). 

He signed a 10 year deal. DO YOU KNOW WTF 10 year is? (10 years ago, the iPhone 2 came out) Pretty sure it's half the life of most of you fucks. 

You want to know something AMAZING? Gap and Kanye have yet to release the first collection, set to come out, early 2021. This shit will sell out quick and make GAP, the new COOL brand. 

People in their 20s buying yeezys and feeding the hype, will buy the yeezy gap collection. They will be in line for it, they will buy it no matter what. Same thing happen with Jordan fans buying retro sneakers re-releasing every 5-6 years. 

We as a community should make GAP our meme stock and let Kanye do his thing. HELL, he might even be president of American lol. 

Who's with me? I'm at { } to YOLO this b.

Title: OTGLY CD Project Red DD
To thank WSB for the $150k gain I made this year by reading other DDs, below is analysis of Cd Projekt Red and full disclaimer I own 1500 shares bought in at $18.7.

The caveats:

* Company hyped up the game to the moon, release was buggy for 7-year-old older PS4 and Xbox consoles. Company was not able to even find most these bugs during their testing stage.
* Company "manipulated" reviewers by not sending OG console version for review. Company execs tweeted the game played "surprisingly good" on OG console right before launch, which is now leading the investigation of class lawsuit on security fraud.
* Even if the game wasn't buggy, gamers believe the company false advertised the game as next generation open-world RPG with non-linear story telling and impactful life choices - but the game is rather more like a more open action RPG where most of the open world components were either cut or still under development at this moment.
* Because of how bad the game was in terms of FPS and bugs, Sony pulled the game a week ago and issued refund for all play station gamers.

The pros:

* Company management and exec team owns a large stage of the company (&gt;15%) and have been running the company \~20 years. For a game studio of more than 1k employees, their execs are under paid relative to the industry [https://simplywall.st/stocks/pl/media/wse-cdr/cd-projekt-shares/news/our-take-on-cd-projekts-wsecdr-ceo-salary](https://simplywall.st/stocks/pl/media/wse-cdr/cd-projekt-shares/news/our-take-on-cd-projekts-wsecdr-ceo-salary) this shows strong financial incentive for long term performance of the company from the management team.
* Through the most recent post release conference call, we learned that COVID has impacted their QA partners and QA process where testing among multiple remote location and onsite location renders issues harder to identify - this shows a temporary problem and as more gamers are playing and sending live data to the game, bugs are going to be easier to reproduce and patched. In fact as ridiculous as it sounds, the more buggy the release is, the easier it would be for the company to fix these bugs. Full conference call script can be found here [https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/presentations/?presentationtype=conference-calls](https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/presentations/?presentationtype=conference-calls) another thing to consider was The Witcher game also suffered serious bugs at launch.
* The company is known for its strong suit for story telling and artistic choices among most studios and Cyberpunk 2077 still mostly nailed it. While other game studios aim for safe and conventional re-skin of their games, the company takes risks and explores new territories of visual designs, which creates down stream pop-culture effects for Movies (Netflix), Phones (OnePlus) and other peripherals where CDPR could benefit from which I don't believe can be priced in short term as artistic societal impact is hard to quantify the photo mode as well as character design is done super well in the game (as seen in [https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/) ) and we can see that gamers still largely support the game due to its artistic and story telling merits, and I believe these are going to overweight the issues with car riding and cops for the long term reputation of the game.
* China - The OnePlus Cyberpunk phone is now exclusively launching in China ( [https://www.oneplus.com/cn/8t-cyberpunk2077?from=head](https://www.oneplus.com/cn/8t-cyberpunk2077?from=head)). We won't have actual licensing fee per unit but the phones have sold out. As gamers in China are mostly on PC and there are a huge population there where the original sales projection didn't include China as there is no official channel of sales (gamers mostly download pirated copies), I think this is an untapped market CDPR will get in soon. [https://www.pcgamesn.com/cyberpunk-2077/sales-china](https://www.pcgamesn.com/cyberpunk-2077/sales-china)
* Despite the removal of the Play Station game, as of 12/20 the game sold 13 million copies (factored in refunds), lower than 16 million copies of expectation at launch. Consider half of their sales are console and play station is around another half of all console market, missing 3 million is pretty on the mark and it could also mean their PC is performing better than expectation. The original stock price moving average at $25-30 was anticipating 30 million copies sold over the next 12 months with a potential upside to $30-35, which if accomplished will still give a lower multiple valuation/earning to the stock price similar to EA and Ubisoft for the Cyberpunk 2077 game alone. The current stock price around $18 would be justified from industry average multiple if the game sold for only under 20 million copies over the next 12 months without any other sales from their other games. After the bugs are patched, newer consoles are available, Ubisoft gamers finished Watchdog and Valhalla and are looking for new stories, I believe the game can still easily deliver over 30 million copies in 2021 which will support a price target of $30-35.
* Fandom around Cyberpunk culture and word of month from the romantic storylines should not be underestimated (see [https://www.reddit.com/r/FollowersofCyberJudy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FollowersofCyberJudy/)), and this is what WatchDog, GTA, and other games do not have and I'd expect the network effect from people posting memes, character stories which could drive more sales are not priced in. I'd argue CDPR is a mater of pop culture story telling therefore [https://www.dualshockers.com/the-witcher-season-2-first-script-page-revealed/](https://www.dualshockers.com/the-witcher-season-2-first-script-page-revealed/)
* Lastly people forgot that only half of the CDPR team is working on CyberPunk, others are working on existing and new games. With 13 million copies already covering the cost of development, I don't see any financial issues even if the company settle the lawsuit (if it ever materializes) and it won't impact their development pipeline of other games. Witcher is still ongoing and their Switch sales number likely won't be revealed until March [https://gamerant.com/cd-projekt-red-praises-witcher-3-performance-switch/](https://gamerant.com/cd-projekt-red-praises-witcher-3-performance-switch/)

Other WSB factors

* CDPR predicted that their whole game is going to be a meme two years ago [https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1013883730929340418?s=20](https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1013883730929340418?s=20) and it indeed becomes one.
* Elon tweeted CDPR about his "Huge Cock" [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1338505515719143425/photo/1](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1338505515719143425/photo/1)

TL:DR - OTGLY will likely recover beyond $30 over the next 3 months with a 40% potential gain.

"Cash provided by operating activities during 2019 was primarily attributable to net income of $40.9 million and noncash adjustments to net income of $229.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $65.1 million, which included the following:

an increase in accounts receivable of $42.1 million due to an increase in billings for advertising plans, particularly for customers paying in arrears, as well as the timing of payments from these customers;

an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $1.3 million;

a decrease in operating lease liabilities of $41.8 million due to operating lease payments made during the year; and

an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $20.1 million, primarily driven by an increase in accrued employee compensation and related costs due to a change in the frequency of pay cycles. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses related to various operating expenses."

Title: Did you miss out on EV? The next $LAZR, $VLDR
Two thing are so overhyped rn: SPACs and EV. Now that EV is booming, companies that make LIDAR sensors (which make electric cars self-aware  and autonomous). I know you guys just buy meme stocks without knowing what they do, but that's what $LAZR does and why it was hyped to 4x NAV.  


Ouster literally THE leader in autonomous vehicle LIDAR, was rumored to be nearing a deal to merge with SPAC $CLA. Now the deal has been officially announced, but they haven't merged yet obviously and no DA yet so it appears. Source is Reuters and this was also covered by Bloomberg. Both have a great track record with breaking SPAC news.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ouster-m-a-colonnade-acqsn-exclusive-idUSKBN28W00B](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ouster-m-a-colonnade-acqsn-exclusive-idUSKBN28W00B)

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ouster-m-a-colonnade-acqsn/lidar-start-up-ouster-agrees-1-9-billion-deal-to-go-public-idUSKBN28W1D3](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ouster-m-a-colonnade-acqsn/lidar-start-up-ouster-agrees-1-9-billion-deal-to-go-public-idUSKBN28W1D3)  


$LAZR is sitting on a $12.3B market cap with stellar projected sales: $15M this year and $418M in 5 years. $CLA on the other hand (if and when this deal goes through) has a market cap of $2.8B when it has more projected sales this year $18M and has double the projected sales in 5 years: $818M. 

[https://twitter.com/DJohnson\_CPA/status/1341395521169215488?s=20](https://twitter.com/DJohnson_CPA/status/1341395521169215488?s=20)

If $CLA is priced based on where it is now, based on the way the free market priced $LAZR, $CLA should have a market cap of $14.8B which means a share price of $81 (5.5x INCREASE!). But it gets better, based on future growth which I know the market loves $CLA should have a market cap of $133 (8.5X INCREASE!). I know these valuations for EVs/LIDAR is bonkers, especially for $CLA but still, that's the way the market is pricing this stuff. So when I tell you a 2-3X increase from $CLA, I'm being conservative.  


Not only that, but I'm even more bullish on Ouster compared to its LIDAR competitors. LIDAR is super expensive and Ouster's goal is to be cost-effective. It's pricing is noticeably cheaper than LAZR. A similar product that is cheaper translates to more widespread adaptability. Furthurmore, unlike its LIDAR competitors, Ouster is not tied down by the EV industry with only \~20% of its sale constituting EV vehicles. The rest are in industries such as tech and industrials. This means that Ouster has more opportunities to expand into different streams of revenue.

[https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/02/the-ars-technica-guide-to-the-lidar-industry/](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/02/the-ars-technica-guide-to-the-lidar-industry/)

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as this deal becomes official and Cramer and the CNBC boys hype this up to boomers and institutional investors this is going to the stratosphere then mars then Saturn and Jupiter for superpower boosts.  


Positions: (I'm poor: 69 shares of $CLA)

Been reading up on Titan Medical this week since I saw a mention they secured a couple huge $10 million awards from Medtronic a couple months ago and more to be awarded soon as they hit milestones in their development.

Chatter on Yahoo is they expect a minimum $1 billion takeover offer in 2021, with only 82 million shares outstanding that's $12/share - currently its @ $1.55/share.

Anyone have some deeper DD to share please??? :-)

Title: Convenience store shakeup play
Now I am not one to typically post on reddit let alone post on this sub, but you guys have made me some solid money so figured I would pass along my own knowledge of the shit show of convenience stores right now and how you can make major tendies on this shit. So last year the biggest sale in the industry occurred with 7-11 buying Speedway LLC from Marathon Petroleum. Since MP was getting railed with oil prices they were desperate for cash. So that sale is announced to officially close in Q1 2021 which is wicked fast.

**Why does any of that matter?** 

So right now there is a lot of transactions of large chains being absorbed by larger chains. Just 2020 alone has led to some huge transactions:  
[https://csnews.com/year-review-top-ma-deals-2020](https://csnews.com/year-review-top-ma-deals-2020)

This is all pointing in a big shakeup of the industry. With more electric vehicle sales there are only a few chains doing some small piloting of electric charging stations. Bring in Recharge acquisition corporation (RCHG). This bad boy snuck under the radar as a holding company looking to buy 1 billion in stores with their new public funds: [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/20/2131168/0/en/Recharge-Acquisition-Corp-Announces-Separate-Trading-of-its-Class-A-Common-Stock-and-Warrants-Commencing-on-or-about-November-23-2020.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/20/2131168/0/en/Recharge-Acquisition-Corp-Announces-Separate-Trading-of-its-Class-A-Common-Stock-and-Warrants-Commencing-on-or-about-November-23-2020.html)  


This company is led ed by Chairman Rajesh Soin, CEO Anthony Kenneyand Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Michael Gearhardt.

[https://csnews.com/recharge-acquisition-corp-completes-200m-ipo-will-seek-opportunities-c-store-industry](https://csnews.com/recharge-acquisition-corp-completes-200m-ipo-will-seek-opportunities-c-store-industry)

Most importantly with this is that Anthony Kenney (previous CEO of Speedway) is running the show here. He was a proponent for Speedway to go towards electric but big daddy Marathon wouldnt have liked that. Right now there is a huge gap in the industry for newer age convenience stores that support electric vehicles while also offering frictionless checkout (amazon go type shit). 

&amp;#x200B;

**How does this all tie together?**

With the sale of speedway to 7-11 and the close being so quick in Q1 2020 you best believe that 7-11 wont be taking all the stores under their wing. They have too many overlapping stores in markets that would cause lack of competition. They would never get approved so they will need to liquidate some of the new stores. Their press release even mentions sale as an option for providing liquidity of up to 5 billion:  
[https://corp.7-eleven.com/corp-press-releases/08-02-2020-7-eleven-inc-transforms-its-u-s-store-network-through-acquisition-of-speedway](https://corp.7-eleven.com/corp-press-releases/08-02-2020-7-eleven-inc-transforms-its-u-s-store-network-through-acquisition-of-speedway)

This means they will be unloading some stores and with that this new Recharge acquisition corp will be snatching up some likely after the sale. With the leadership of Anthony Kenney and the eventual shake up of the industry I would expect this stock to pop the second the purchase of the stores are announced by RCHG in Q1-Q2 2021.

Title: AST SpaceMobile - Huge SPAC opportunity
I saw a post here a few days ago about AST SpaceMobile which caught my interest (link at the bottom), while the xmas slowdown is on I thought I might see if I can find anything that was originally missed - oh boy does it get juicy. I found their institutional investors presentation from last week, sharing some slides as hedge funds dont get a monopoly on this.

This might be a long one so TLDR at the bottom, and Ive split this DD into sections.

# Context

Last week on the 16th, it was announced that AST SpaceMobile were going to be taken public via a SPAC (New Providence Acquisition Corp), for $1.4 Billion, the merger should happen in Q1 next year. They are a company who are building the **first** and **only**, space based, cellular broadband network to be accessible by any standard mobile phone. This considerably expands the reach and reliability of network providers mobile broadband coverage. Something traditional companies have tried to do but only with specialised hardware devices  connecting to smaller less powerful satellites.

https://preview.redd.it/me1kyphghx661.png?width=903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77acf3ce971645898f7bcbaf0bba4883d8361225

# Business Model

It only gets better from here, they already have signed commercial agreements with huge players such as Vodaphone, AT&amp;T, Telefonica + many more firms who cover emerging markets like Indosat for Indonesia - This sums up to **1.3bn existing subscribers**. AST operate a business-to-business model, if an end user of one of these telecom companies loses coverage, they get notified if they want to use ASTs coverage to reconnect. This will be a surcharge and cost 1-2 USD a month for countries like India and revenue is split 50/50 between AST and the telecom company.

This offers two major benefits for telecom companies:

 Growth from adding extra value to subscribers

 Providing a differentiated service so reduces churn between providers

Since it is a low cost, efficient, wholesale model theyre targeting 90%+ EBITDA Margins. Either you're a provider who can offer unlimited coverage or you're not. This will be huge for emerging economies who don't have the infrastructure in place already.

# Valuation

As I am writing this, its trading about $12 which puts the EV/24E EBITDA at 1.7x, compared to comps of 13.3x.

https://preview.redd.it/eyxqzoshhx661.png?width=679&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c4e8905382d31e879b8383228671fd834a29f24

To be trading inline with its comparable companies, the price should be **$51-77** after the merger.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aluwqx9tix661.png?width=394&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72e91ee36f458ffb2103dbf1a2294047644212d6

Even a very bearish analysis would put the target price at $25-30. So what does this all mean? Well AST is incredibly attractive price right now, and its climbing, the last two days have seen a 20% increase in price as investors start really jumping into the SPAC because of this.

# Investment Thesis

There is a lot of appetite for this, being first to market with no competitors gives a huge advantage, already having agreements/partnerships in place means that theyre hitting the ground running. Patents and high barriers to entry will restrict direct competitors from being able to compete for a substantial period. The deal will go live in Feb-March next year so lets get rich and get in before it takes off.

**TLDR**

AST SpaceMobile is going public via a SPAC in 1Q 20 (SPAC is trading now). Its the first and only company to offer space based, cellular broadband that will work with the existing Iphone youre reading this off now  no extra hardware or software needed. They already have 1.3bn subscribers via partnered telecom companies and are targeting the 51% of the global population without any coverage. Price is now $12 but should be $50-70 to be inline with comparable comps. Deal announced last week and its getting hot. Jump in early and     .

The SPACs ticker is NP(A)

OG post I took the idea from:

Title: Pot stocks, the GA senate, and the art of the deal
The GA senate rate is coming up on Jan 5th.

Trump is turning out to be a big ally for the dems using his 'art of the deal' techniques to bomb the republican party by asking for higher stim payments to individuals (which Pelosi quickly agreed to).

The polls are close as hell and it looks like it's a coinflip.

Why does this matter?

Look what happened to pot stocks when biden won the presidency. That will happen again if the dems win the senate race because it means we will have federally decriminalized pot in 2021. If you were in pot stocks before the election, you know how much money we made. If you weren't, you missed the fuck out.

Look at the picture. See the giant spike in november? That was the election erection.

&amp;#x200B;

Pot stocks have backed off their recent highs and IV is at the lowest it will be prior to the election. Now is the time to get in. You want gamble? Buy Jan 18th calls. Buy them out of the money. Buy a lot of them. If the dems lose, they will drop to 0. If the dems win, your calls will enter valhalla.

This is a goddamn gamble so my calls are short term and OTM at a few different strikes.

Title: Anyone in Dynavax Technologies? The Sinovac Vaccine Efficacy is being announced today.
As the title says, I dumped my spare cash into Dynavax Technologies, which manufactures the adjuvant for the Sinovac Vaccine. Preliminary trials showed an efficacy over 50%, with the results being announced by the Butantan Institute of So Paulo, Brazil today. It will supply most of South America, Russia and Asias vaccine demand. 46million vaccines already ordered by the Brazilian Government, with room for an increase to 150million. Sinovac is a Chinese company, and the CCP are relying on them to produce these vaccines. The Eastern nations would place a total order of 3 billion vaccines. If efficacy is above 90%, which is the most desirable result, then you could see Dynavax skyrocket.

Positions- 6000 shares at $4.94

Title: If you missed out on $LMND, $ROOT is the play.
I will get straight to the point, $LMND and $ROOT are both insurance companies, but have drastically different business models. $LMND has mooned to all-time highs while $ROOT has fallen to lows and in this DD I will compare both and show you that $ROOT is better. 

**Business Models:**

Root is a TECH company that uses a model to determines insurance premiums based on a persons driving skills. Better driver means less likely to crash means less likely for Root to have to payout insurance claims. The great thing is all Root customers install the app on their phone, and it tracks their driving, allowing Root to collect more data and improve its model, increasing margins as they can better detect who is likely to crash their car.  This model is unique and gives Root a high MOAT as well as high potential market share.

Lemonade is an insurance company like Root, except they are NOT a TECH company. Their business model is just traditional reinsurance, nothing new, no moat. The only thing "tech" about them is the fact the UI on their website looks good. So this brings me to my next point: valuations. 

**Valuations:**

Lemonade, as a traditional insurance company is being evaluated like a tech company. They have a QUARTER YES A QUARTER of Root's sales (97Mil vs 402Mil respectively) and a HIGHER MARKETCAP SOMEHOW (6.55B vs 4.58B respectively). Now these evaluations would make sense if Lemonade was a tech company and Root wasnt. It would make sense if Lemonade had room to grow or something unique about it separating it from other insurance companies. But no its literally the same as every other insurance company. While Root the actual company with room to grow and high moat is evaluated like Lemonade should have been. Is this opposite year or something? 

**TLDR AND THE PLAY:**

Lemonade is a boomer company in disguise but has high valuation while a tech company like Root is does not. Root 20C Any exp before April ( thats when lock up ends). Free tendies.

Title: $SNOW MASSIVE Dilution Incoming &amp; Easy Put Opportunity $$$
I put together the below DD for retards together in bullets so you retards could easily follow. Everyone knows SNOW is MASSIVELY overvalued and there is a tremendous Put opportunity in the next few weeks/months as 2 more significant share unlocks are coming. 

&amp;#x200B;

* We have seen a massive run up in $SNOW with very small volume because the float is incredibly small at 30M shares prior to the first lockup. All of this is changing over the next few months. SNOWs lockup period is in three stages:

1. The first lockup expiration for $SNOW was on December 15th of 11M shares. Prior to the first lockup the stock ran up to $420 then going into this lockup traded all the way down to $300 into expiration.
2. The second lockup expiration is expected Jan 4-7th per the S1 I posted below by meeting the post IPO requirements. Per the S1 below, this unlocks 37M shares, the float today is only 50M shares, that is a 60% increase in the float and with that many new shares available paired with ultra low volume we see on buy side, that should cause the stock to massively correct. 
3. The third and largest lockup is March 5th 2021 and will take the free float to 345m shares.

* The stock is INCREDIBLY overvalued trading over 200 x 2021 price to sales. To put that into perspective Tesla only trades at 23 x 2021 sales. 
   * Snow CEO makes $1.3B annually while revenue this year is only $489M, can't imagine shareholders will continue to be okay with this
* Stock today trades at $350, you can see over the last week since the first lockup, MMs have been manipulating the price higher (easily done with a small float) for their clients to get out at a higher price. Look at the very low volume and also the order book. 
   * Once the 32m shares unlock, many of which employees received at less than $10, they will be selling before the stock goes any lower, especially before the big lockup expiration in March. Given the low volume and limited buyers, it will be hard to manipulate this stock with these shares entering the market
* Now some of you will protest saying nothing happened to Uber during their lockup expiration, however their float was 700M SHARES at unlock compared to the only 50M shares for SNOW, this is significant and will push the stock down substantially. 
* The stock ran up to $420 after a poor earnings report, prior to that it was showing some support at $250, I think that is the minimum this stock drops to over the next few weeks. Also, if we see a market sell off, as insiders are looking to dump shares, this will fall off a cliff.
* Since my balls don't drag on the ground when I walk, I am not trying to time this perfectly. I own feb 300p to give it a few weeks after jan expiration and may 250p to give it some time after March expiration. Positions below, $10k in each. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: SNOW very overvalued with a very small float and on low volume. Two large lockup expirations coming soon that will cause the stock to plummet as insiders sell. Buy puts. 

&amp;#x200B;

This shows price to sales ratio for large companies and how massively overvalued SNOW is, this is a few weeks old but still relevant

Title: $MGA: AAPLs, EVs and low Implied Volatility
All I have heard about the last couple of days is AAPL getting into EVs, how it affects Tesla etc. I cant believe no one has brought up Magna International ($MGA) yet. They are a legit Tier-1 EV supplier with $40B in revenue (yet only a $19.9b market cap) that is a top contender to partner with AAPL. News just broke tonight as I was typing this up of Magna creating a $1B joint venture with LG electronics to make EV gear ([https://www.reuters.com/article/lg-elec-magna-intl-jv-idUSKBN28X0BC](https://www.reuters.com/article/lg-elec-magna-intl-jv-idUSKBN28X0BC)). Oh and options are dirt cheap, with implied volatility currently around 35 and a low company valuation (only  \~1/2x revenue and under 10x forward P/E). This is still early innings for this play. Some key points about Magna:

	Has already had prior discussions with AAPL regarding outsourcing their vehicles ([https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/us-business/magna-in-good-position-to-build-apple-google-cars-says-ceo/article24320885/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/us-business/magna-in-good-position-to-build-apple-google-cars-says-ceo/article24320885/))

	Prototype that MGA supplied to AAPL in 2012 looks very similar to AAPLs current prototype ([https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/))

	Boomers are catching wind of it, picture below is from today

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hetv5xm1fv661.png?width=468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25835c59093a90ffb29f539e79e8b075a397af90

	Fisker (FSR) recently announced they will use Magnas EV platform for their upcoming Ocean SUV. Magna has warrants for 6% equity stake in FSR. Fiskers market cap is currently \~$4.4b, implying Magnas stake is worth north of $250m.

	Invested in Waymo (Googles self-driving car program) alongside other top-tier investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Silver Lake and partnered with Waymo on their first factory 

	Very active in core autonomous technologies and is first to market with solid-state LiDAR ([https://www.magna.com/blog/post/on-the-road-to-a-complete-adas-systems-provider](https://www.magna.com/blog/post/on-the-road-to-a-complete-adas-systems-provider))

	Makes the Jaguar i-Pace since 2018 (Waymo placed order for 20,000 vehicles plus 20,000 other vehicles sold)

**Financials/Stock:**

	Currently at 52-week high

	Market cap just under $20B with $38B revenue

	Operating cash flow more than doubled in last quarter to $1.6B

	Trades for under 10x forward P/E

**How this trade goes right:**

	Perception of potential AAPL partnership drives share price up, already has good momentum

	Actual AAPL partnership sends this to the moon

	Fisker goes on a run and MGA benefits from equity stake

	Low implied volatility gives this trade very good risk:reward

	Valuation multiple catches up to comparable EV suppliers 

**Risks and mitigants:**

	Current market conditions erode, causing a broad market selloff. This risk is low over the next year given the Fed is committed to keeping interest rates low at least until 2023-2024 and pumping billions of dollars worth of liquidity into the market each day (incl. purchases of corporate bonds and junk debt).

	AAPL partnership doesnt materialize. Apples exclusive leak to Reuters highlights the tech giants intent to produce cars. While I think Magna is in the pole position to win business from AAPL, Magna already has a robust business that will grow well next year without any AAPL revenue. Magnas relatively cheap valuation vs. peers gives the stock plenty of runway without AAPL hype.

Title: Why it's not too late (still early) to invest in Magnite (MGNI) - CTV/PTV play
MGNI holder since $10 here. Also holding 800 call option contracts (positions at the end of post). It has been one of my top performers and is still in BEAST MODE. Some of you may have seen Laura Martin (same analyst who called FUBO early) mention on CNBC today that it is her top stock pick for 2021 and could run up 500% when asked by the hosts. Her pick caused MGNI to run up another 17% after hours.

IT IS STILL NOT TOO LATE TO GET IN. In fact, you are early. This is going to keep running, here is why:

We are just starting to see advertisers open up their budgets for Programmatic Advertising more and more. You've heard of cord cutting, right? You know you don't watch shit cable TV or at least don't want to anymore, right? Well, your favorite apps or shows on Connected TV (AppleTV, FireTV, Hulu, Netflix etc etc) are just beginning to work in advertising spots on their free programming. Magnite is the one who sells alot of those ads for massive clients (exclusive agency for Disney Hulu and Discovery Networks) and they will absolutely add more partners. This is just the beginning. I would say we are 30% of the way into adoption from big brand advertisers (they can also serve small-mid brands).

In addition, the technology they have processes super targeted ads in real time. This is much better for advertisers than what they got on linear. These advertisers have to follow the audience. They have no choice and the younger generations are ditching the cable box completely. This is like investing into the ad agencies that got huge at the inception of the television. BIG MONEY. Lots of room to grow.

Magnite is also working closely with TTD (TradeDesk) to develop identity technology (think cookies) that is less intrusive to the user/consumer. TTD is buying the ads for the big brand advertisers from MGNI who represents the sellers (Disney Hulu etc).

TTD has a $50B market cap. MGNI is sitting right around a $3B cap right now. You see where I am going here. This company will grow and probably quickly since they are leading the sell side (SSP) of the Programmatic TV industry right now. Happy to answer more for any of you who have questions.

Here is a great thread on Twitter that breaks down CTV/PTV, TTD and MGNI among others:

Title: Computer Vision vs Lidar ($AMBA)
With the recent ev boom a lot of focus has shifted to stocks in the lidar industry such as luminar, velodyne, aeva, and now possibly microvision. Elon musk has said in the past that lidar although useful now, is more of a temporary solution that computer vision will make obsolete. One stock I feel that is completely under the radar (or under the lidar) right now is Ambarella ($AMBA). With a market cap of a little over 3 billion they focus on computer vision technologies with one of their applications being the automotive industry. I honestly think computer vision is the route to go with as it will allow for more features compared to just range tracking as found with lidar.

TLDR: $AMBA = good, computer vision &gt; Lidar

Title: GME DD Fresh Perspectives Only Pt.1
**GME Fresh Perspectives Pt.1** (sources at the bottom)

Hello Autists,

Here is the Pt1 of daily fresh perspectives I promised. Im breaking them down to chewable bits (less than 5 min read ea) because I know reading isnt fun. Im with you, I dont enjoy reading either. Please let me know kindly if any of this gets too boring.

 Through this series of DDs, I hope to show you guys perhaps *some* of what Cohen sees.

 Please note that I will be referring to these 2 points in this DD, and maybe even throughout this DD series. These are the most important points that would form the foundation of my DD but they aren't the 'freshest' I apologize.

 **1. Let me start by pointing out that most of us WSB autists are privileged. There exists the others, who actually make up the majority of the population** who/whose kids cant afford to risk losing hundreds if not thousands of dollars making educated guesses/gambling the way we do. 

As a group, its easy for us to confirm each others biases, forget about the rest and create our own echo chamber.

 **2. Digital games is overtaking physical copies. This is true.** 

SONY, EA, Take Two all have crossed a tipping point where more than half of their console games are now sold via download 51%, 52% and 55% 

For Sony, it was up from 37% last year. (Source A)  
 

Generally, the growth of digital vs discs seems to be quite even, so using SONY as an example, thats a 38% increase (Yes. Its a 14% difference, but its a 38% increase from 37% that takes it to 51%). That means GMEs going to experience apx 26% decrease YOY in sales. 

**BUT!**  
 The global console games market is expected to grow from $40.6 billion in 2019 to about $57.9 billion in 2020 (source B) Thats a 42.6% increase.

&amp;#x200B;

[The numbers,](https://preview.redd.it/wiy7milvwu661.jpg?width=735&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=795d2a001ba7d25b4e7275f732ba8514d3df0c17)

 **Young Mason:** This mean physical copies are dying! GME is DEAD!   


Not quite. Actually, not at all. GME will definitely get a smaller piece of the *console pie*, but the pie itself has grown and they will actually get a larger pie.

**But wait, theres more!** The research/stats was published in May. Did anyone project COVID will be as bad as it is now? Stay at home kids want to play games, meet desperate WFH parents that want a break. I am confident that the 2 factors push the numbers a lot higher than $57.90 Billion, but hey for now lets just use that.   
  Also remember, that % for digital games download vs physical is based on quantity including all the shit/old games they push for cheap and people buy out of boredom. Although the numbers arent reported solid, the consensus is, is that more disc consoles are sold because people want to play their old disc games. Even at a modest 50/50, were locked in more or less until the next console cycle. 

**But wait, theres even more!**   
  So the console pie has grown 42.6%. You know what else has grown and is growing?  

Gaming overall! Mobile, PC, even board games, theyve all been growing. Checkout Gamestops website.  

Theyve been getting into phones, computer parts and board games. Its not out of desperation. It is the right move as Gamestop is really establishing its brand as one stop shop for games. When you think building supplies, you think Home Depot. Soon, when you think games, you will think Gamestop.

Gamestop is already set up for used games/devices trading like no one else. Phones are super liquid and high in demand (This isn't anything serious YET, I will cover this in another DD). Did I tell you that the digital consoles are now more tradable/rentable too? No moving parts = very low risk of damage other than drops/spills. Keep an eye on this. Remember the point #1. 

 Carrying computer parts also shield them from any sort of lockdown possibility because computer parts are essential. Bigger pie, and more pies.   
 

**What you are saying makes sense but bro, dont you remember Q3 earnings?**

Yes, I doBro. They had a decrease in revenue. Do you remember Q3 was for August, September, October? 

Were you really thinking about video games back then? We were all out there seeing friends, partying, enjoying nature thinking either Covid was gone and it was renaissance or thinking second wave is coming, and we have to enjoy it while it lasts.

 **Establishing its brand? Are you nuts? People hate GME.**

Yes. **We do**. We all have that bitter memory. We remember the day when we or our friend went to GME to literally get hustled as a noob kid like we remember going to the strip club to get hustled as a noob adult.   
 

Remember, we are ALL 18\~40+, privileged minority. (Point#1).   
 Peak gaming target demographics is around 13\~25.

Right now, GME is putting trade value of all games online, updated daily and it isnt as hustly as it used to be. This is a simple change, but powerful. People now know exactly what to expect, and theyd only bring in games/consoles, when they see the money/credit is worth more for them.

Results? Happier transactions on both ends, and better branding moving forward.

Theyve also been spending a lot more on advertising for brand recognition. That recognition will soon put them in a spot where they are the only one that can organize e-sports/gaming tournaments in the western world in any meaningful way. 

I will leave you with this. The majority (Point #1) isnt so lucky to start blowing money at the launch of a new console. Where can the majority go to fill their increase in gaming needs while being fiscally conservative during this pandemic? eBay? With all this shipping delays? 

Like how Amazon is eating eBays breakfast but eBay will always have its market share in ecommerce, GME will always have its place in gaming at the very least. 

**Tomorrow I will tell you why GME will crush Amazon and not the other way around, and also touch up on either what their current valuation means to Cohen, or the future of gaming.**

Dont worry, Im even going to cover Stadia at one point too.

Title: GME short squeeze is a myth that assumes massive incompetence from people that actually know what they are doing.
So with GME running the myth of the inevitable short squeeze has popped up again.  In order for this to happen a ton of people need to short the stock naked.  Which among competent investors is really fucking rare.  I will walk through it below but you can also click this link:

https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/021715/how-protect-short-position-options.asp

For example lets assume you wanted to short GME today at $20 a share.  So you sell 100 shares short at $20 each.  With a naked short you have unlimited losses as the stock runs up.  Nobody who knows what the fuck they are doing is going to do that when you can hedge to cap that loss.  A single January 21 call at a strike of 21 had a high of 2.42 today would hedge that just fine.

You short the shares and buy the call.  Your break even is now 17.68 on your short but your max loss is now $342 without borrowing costs assuming it closes at $20.99 on expiry.  Call expiring worthless for loss of $242 and $99 to cover the short.  

Borrowing costs on 100 shares at 20% and stock at 20 is about $1 a day.  Assuming everything is held to expiry with the January expiry would be about $25.

So max loss regardless of how high the stock goes is less than $400.

Your break even is kind of ass but thats because you are protected until mid Jan.  However if IV is particularly high, even if the stock goes down pushing your return on the short up, the call might still retain enough value that your break even is much higher.  

If its a short term play which a short on today would likely be, you could buy a call for Friday which had a high of 1.15 today which puts your break even at 18.85 assuming you hold until Friday at close.  Factoring in borrowing cost its 18.8.  

Thats a hedged short which likely the vast , vast majority of GME shorts are.  Have you not noticed how fucking expensive relatively speaking call options are even with the spikes. A 20c at close with 1.5 days to expiry had a break even at 20.72 with a volume of 30,000.  Now part of that is people buying lottos but a ton of that is covering shorts.

So the whole premise of there are millions of shares that are short at $5 or $7 is some serious bullshit.  Yes there were 70m shares short give or take 2m at the end of October and there were the same number of shares short at the end of November.  This does not mean they are the same fucking people shorting it. Some have covered, some executed hedges and others have sold that shit short at higher prices.

For example today alone 8m shares were shorted.

https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme

Yesterday there were 3m shares shorted.  Borrowing rates are in the 20% range, which works out to around $1 total per 100 shares.  Or a single fucking tick downward.  So no institutions arent going to be covering shares they shorted at $15 when it spikes to $19.

But why has it been spiking if its not a short squeeze, and thats really fucking simple, a ton of people are playing the momentum on it.  Hell 10% of the daily thread is people spamming to buy shares and you can make some money provided you dont buy the top.  Its not a coincidence that they announce the stimulus and the stock spiked and I would be willing to bet that the vast majority of shares bought today were through Robinhood.

But Cohen you say?  He added another 3%, yeah he added 3% directly on the dip after earnings.  Hes in at $12 - $13 range based off the timings of the 13d.  If you are wondering what happens if he decides that the board isnt being accommodating enough and drops his shares look at what happened the day Buffet said he was dropping airlines.  He can eat the ride down to $13 and still be profitable.

Then finally the biggest piece to the short squeeze is long term positive catalysts, the last significant short squeeze came from ACB two earnings ago when they closed the gap on their loss and cancelled their at the money offering.  At that point the long term growth story fundamentally changed as did the state of the business.  Thats what it takes to force a short squeeze, doubling e-commerce sales when overall sales are still massively down isnt going to cut it.  A slightly green quarter during the launch of multiple new consoles isnt going to do it either.  Now if they follow that with another solidly profitable quarter in May, at that point a squeeze is possible.


TL:DR:  The infinite short squeeze on GameStop is a bullshit argument assuming basic competence from anyone shorting the stock.  Options were in fact originally designed to offset the risks of shorting.  It will go up as long as more people are willing to become bagholders, just dont be shocked when it comes crashing down.  It also explains the crazy ass high IV on call options.

Title: FUBO is an absolute monster and MGNI was picked to be next today
On this sector Needham and Laura Martin have been dialed in. In the Winter of 2018 Laura picked Roku as her #1 stock for 2019 -- went on to an over 400% gain. In the Winter of 2019 she called TTD her #1 pick of the year for 2020 -- despite covid, look how TTD performed!

And now Laura is going with MGNI for 2021. I'd say that's a pretty good endorsement considering the source.

This stock has been on a straight uptrend and now has all eyes on it after this news. It was talked about on CNBC today.

Title: Why I'm bullish on ABML mooning like ALPP.
This interview of the CEO got me really bullish on the market potential.

BASF Circularity Award winner and even hints at partnership with Dupont/BASF or other major players.

TLDR: CEO says recycle plant $30M to build will output 20,000 tons of materials with a top line of $200M. Plant will run easily 50 years with on site 7 employees. 100% sustainable.

Title: Warning: This is the time Hedge Funds try to Manipulate the market
Take anything you read here with a grain of salt for the rest of the year.

**Why?** Hedge funds get their bonuses based on their performance. Also if they are not positive on YOY they will see their AUM evaporate. So they try to manipulate the price of their losers to end the year on a high note. At this point Market Manipulation is the name of the game. There is also tax implications. They are trying to pump their losers because they have to close some of them before the new year.

**How?** Assume you have 5 million in Black Berry stock that is down since the earnings. What would you do? Spend just 100k buying call options which will immediately make Market Makers buy the stock to cover the calls they sold you. This pushes the price up. Then you spread a rumor that there is good news coming. Maybe some insider knows something. You definitely would make a few posts on forums and reddit about this info so that others buy calls and force market makers to buy even more shares. Price goes up and you sell your 5 million worth of stock for 5.5 million. Then you cover unload your calls on people at the tail end of the news cycle. 

I flaired this DD because these kind of MM posts are usually flaired DD and there are people who only read DDs here. 

Also did you notice how posts about buying steel companies tend to be posted within 10 min of each other from 2 different accounts and then no posts about steel companies for 10 days. Then two random new accounts post back to back DDs about steel companies? 

Upvote if this is important for others to know. Down vote if you think I should go to hell.

Title: Why JOE won't slow-- how this stock is primed to double in 2021
Let's start things off by saying that The St. Joe company is hot right now. \[After the promising Q3 that was promised\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jiiw0q/joe\_to\_obliterate\_earnings\_wednesday\_on\_sale\_today/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jiiw0q/joe_to_obliterate_earnings_wednesday_on_sale_today/)), JOE has risen a whopping 42 percent over the past month, and I am here to tell you why that trend won't be changing anytime soon.

&amp;#x200B;

The St. Joe Company is a land development company headquartered in Watersound, Florida, and are currently the second biggest private owners of land in FL (177,000 acres). What makes JOE stand out from the crowd is that they on the precipice of a once in a lifetime bull run when considering all of the bullish cases: An absolutely glamorous forward projections of sales, their control of Walton County, the mass migration from city to suburb, the bullish case for real estate in the US as a whole, and as a hedge against inflation. 

&amp;#x200B;

JOE is currently in a spectacular position, growth-wise. After years of sitting on empty lots and middling growth, The St. Joe Company has found itself now generating a decent cash flow and is reinvesting the profits heavily back into its developments. JOE's latest lots have sold almost instantly at 100 percent margin. With JOE's land ownership being concentrated to specific regions (Florida panhandle/Walton County especially), they stand to gain immensely from the recent growth of residents as their counties/towns transform from ghost towns relying on tourist revenue to legitimate communities where people want to live. Take a look at JOE's Q3 earnings update video showcasing their newest developments in progress \[here\]([https://youtu.be/ije46j7Tc4k](https://youtu.be/ije46j7Tc4k)). As you can see, that is a fuck ton of homes, apartments, and commercial buildings being built on beautiful panhandle land. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to specifically touch on JOE's control of Walton County due to its importance in JOE's future growth. Walton County is one of the fastest growing counties in the nation (4.58% increase this year), and JOE holds almost all of the salable land that remains. Development of these lands into bustling commercial and residential properties is something JOE stands to gain from immensely, as this monopoly will allow them to profit in a huge way. Florida will not stop growing for a long while, and JOE is prepped to build the future of the panhandle and will certainly attract much more attention in the following year as they start reporting their record growth and projections. For the reasons listed (and the implied reasoning that wasn't explained such as hedging against inflation and the bullish case for real estate), I easily see JOE hitting somewhere in the 90-100 range by Q3 next year. This is a stock that, today, still provides great value to investors willing to hold for at least a couple months while investors price in JOE's forward growth along with the near certainty of Florida remaining a booming growth state for years to come.

Title: Missed the EV boom? Lithium start-ups could be the next tidal wave.
**Tl;dr: Read up on Kodal Minerals (KOD: LSE AIM) and consider taking a punt. I am a pure retard and not a financial advisor, take my analysis at your own risk.**

International EV manufacturers have collectively shot to the moon this year. TSLA is likely overvalued, NIO performance has slowed. There are likely to be a range of discrepancies in supporting industries where securities are undervalued (e.g., steel, as recently popularised on this dumbass sub). Undoubtedly, these industries will grow to meet the needs of EV manufacturers as governments set ambitious targets to halt the production of FF vehicles.

Ref 1: [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-54981425](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-54981425)

Ref 2: [https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-Elon-Musk-Wrong-About-Lithium.html](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-Elon-Musk-Wrong-About-Lithium.html)

**If you have not considered the lithium market yet, you should**. As global demand for lithium rises (for EV li-ion batteries) demand is set to rise dramatically, and current supply is insufficient. As such, there are likely to be a range of lithium mining/exploration start-ups that will do astonishingly well in months and years to come, despite the fact lithium as a commodity has fallen in price. Moreover, as lithium is now in a dip, it is an excellent time to buy into the industry.

I draw your attention to Kodal Minerals (KOD: LSE), a British firm headed by Aussie Bernard Aylward, who comes to the firm with high repute. KOD is a mining &amp; exploration company currently developing a project in Bougouni, Mali, with a whopping 350km of potential mining operations, expecting to haul ***1.94 million tonnes*** of lithium over 8 years, with an ***estimated 1.4bn revenue***. The company is currently sat at a **hilarious market cap of 9m, trading at p0.08/share.** The project is in large part funded by Suay Chin, an enormous player in the Chinese lithium market.

Source 6: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdyMZvQzcDg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdyMZvQzcDg)

 ****  **** The current market valuation remains low as KOD awaits a mining permit from the Government of Mali, which is expected in a matter of weeks. I anticipate that as the permit is granted and project action begins, KOD will carry my autistic fucking nut to Pluto. They also hold gold mining permits in Mali and Cte d'Ivoire which will shore up the share price. Definitely worth a look at. ****  **** 

Disclosure: I am in 295k KOD shares at p0.08.

Title: The next meme hot pick for all the 'GOOD BOY' autists. $STIC &gt;&gt; $BARK aka BARK BOX
 **$STIC -- Northern Star Acquisition Corp. (merging with Bark aka Barkbox which will become $BARK)**

**Current stock price:** $13.95

**Enterprise value:** $2.1 billion

**2020 fiscal year revenues (est):** $224 million

**2021 fiscal year revenues (est):** $370 million

**2022 fiscal year revenues (est):** $516 million

**2023 fiscal year revenues (est):** $706 million

 **Price Target:**

If we consider $BARKs 40-50% revenue growth potential over the next few years plus their 60% gross margins plus their current operating margins and net cash positions I think its very fair to consider a 12x sales multiple (conservative) on FY2022 sales of $516M (conservative). This would put the market cap in 15 months (end of FY2022) at around $6.2 billion / 202M outstanding shares equals 15-month price target of $30 to $31 which would be 140-150% upside from Fridays closing price of $12.40

***Heres why Im really excited about $BARK and why I started a 2.5% position in the company last Thursday as soon as the news broke that $STIC was merging with them***

**1.** $BARKs current retention rate of 95% is phenomenal for a consumer products company. This retention rate is more evidence on how much Barkbox customers love their products and see tremendous value in the monthly pricing options. Consumers are realizing you can save a lot of time and money by buying directly from the manufacturer in bulk which is essentially what youre doing with Barkbox plus youre not paying all the overhead costs associated with retail locations.

**2.** People love their dogs which means making them happy as much as possible. I have friends that post videos of the unboxing every month of the Barkbox with their dogs because its such a fun event for them. The dogs go wild as soon as they see the Barkbox coming towards them. As we return to a more normal world after Covid and millions of people are back in offices (at least part-time) they will start to feel the regret and guilt of being away from their dog(s). I believe Barkbox can be one of the solutions to help relieve some of these feelings. We love to spoil our dogs but why deal with the inconvenience of going to the pet store every month when you can just subscribe to Barkbox, save some money, make your dog happy, bring a smile to your own face and take one more errand off your to-do list.

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/o873gn7ast661.jpg?width=950&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4cbc38d1b603332b7250d90788782c8a882c25a)

**3.** Through the first 3 quarters of FY21 $BARKs customer acquisition cost on subscriptions have dropped from $56 to $42 (25% decrease). Theyve also been able to increase their gross profit per subscription by 20% during the same time period. These are both strong trends to watch closely as the company stays in growth mode. I think these numbers are moving in the right direction because of my #6 reason down below (social media &amp; influencer marketing).

**4.** When Barkbox first launched they were using toys and treats from other companies but over the years as theyve gotten to know their customers and analyzed the data...now they design and manufacture more than 90% of their SKUs. On average they design 15 new products every month which means they are always trying to stay ahead of the competition and create the next cool toy or treat rather than playing catch-up. $BARK wants to be the premier innovator and disrupter in the pet industry which I love.

**5.** Bark has embraced the omni-channel strategy which means selling across multiple platforms, both ecommerce and in retail locations. Not only are they doing phenomenally well with their subscription boxes and BarkShop.com website but they are landing huge retail partnerships.

**6.** Bark does an amazing job on social media, they are one of the best Ive seen at sharing great content although lets be honest the cute dogs make it easier. Across all social media platforms Bark and Barkbox now have more than 8 million followers and fans. Ive also noticed that theyre doing a great job working with influencers and affiliates to help drive website traffic, brand awareness and subscription customers.

 As of Fridays close I had a 2.5% position in $STIC which reflects my early excitement and enthusiasm for this company. The stock did rally a little bit last week on the merger announcement however I still think the current stock price and impending enterprise value of $BARK is not yet reflecting the growth potential of this company. I did own $CHWY earlier this year and exited with a decent profit but personally I felt the valuation was getting too rich. I still love the pet industry and I want to be involved but no other company got me excited until I heard that Barkbox was coming public via $STIC. Once I dug into the numbers I knew that I needed to start a position right away which Ill continue to add to in the coming weeks especially on any pullbacks.

 Last Thursday, December 17th, Northern Star Acquisition Corp (SPAC) announced they will be merging with Bark to take the company public. Bark is the parent company of Barkbox and several other similar pet brands. The deal which is expected to close in approximately 3-4 months (early 2021Q2) gave Bark an enterprise value of $1.6 billion. This included $454 million of cash proceeds, $200 million of which came via PIPE from firms/funds including Fidelity and the Federated Hermes Kaufmann Fund). Bark will use these funds to accelerate growth through product development &amp; new product launches as well as customer acquisition via retail channel partnerships and DTC marketing. After the deal closes the ticker symbol will be changed from $STIC to $BARK.

The image below gives you a rough idea of the capital structure and balance sheet:

Across their multiple brands $BARK has more than 1.1 million active subscriptions and 6.5 million lifetime customers which includes sales on Amazon and 23,000 retail locations through Target, Petco, PetSmart, Costco and others. Here are some of Barks toys being sold on Target.com \[[click here](https://www.target.com/b/bark/-/N-iskuo?Nao=0)\]

With more than 300 million pets in the US and the global pet industry expected to reach $100+ billion in sales this year it means $BARK is operating within a massive TAm. With that large TAM means plenty of competition but I strongly believe $BARK has carved out a nice niche for themselves which means plenty of room for exponential growth.

Part of $BARKs strategy going forward is to launch new products and services they can upsell to their 1.1+ million subscription customers. This strategy should keep customer acquisition costs low leading to better operating margins and quicker profitability. In the first half of FY2021 $BARK saw 179% YoY revenue growth from new product lines so this could be a massive growth engine moving forward. $BARK knows what their customers want and now they have the capital to build it for them. Since the company has so much data on both dogs and pet owners they are able to create new products and launch new brands with a high probability of success.

$BARK is also planning to expand their relationships with Amazon and their other retail partners. Over the past year $BARKs sales on Amazon were up 2.5x so it makes sense why this is a focus for them.

For Barks current fiscal year which ends on March 31, 2021 the company expects $370 million of revenues which is 65% revenue growth over fiscal year 2020. The company is also forecasting 60% gross margins (was 61.2% in the first half of FY21). These gross margins are superior to any other public companies in the pet industry such as $CWHY and $FRPT

Going forward the company is forecasting $516 million for fiscal year 2022 and $706 million for fiscal year 2023 -- they are probably low-balling the forecasts because its always better to under-promise and over-deliver once youre a public company.

If these forecasts come to fruition it would represent 40% revenue growth and 37% revenue growth respectively for FY2022 and FY2023. $BARK expects gross margins to stay around 59-60% for the foreseeable future. The company expects to lose money through 2023 which is slightly disappointing but not surprising for a consumer products company in growth mode. Personally I think the companys estimates in their investor presentation will prove to be too low and the company should beat them quite easily. Dont underestimate the increased brand awareness that goes along with being a public company. Once $BARK is trading under its own ticker symbol and being talked about in the media, on blog sites, on trading platforms and of course on FinTwit it means this really awesome company is now getting exposure to millions of new potential customers.

In terms of public company comparisons, Id say Chewy which trades under $CHWY is the best one to use. Chewy was founded a year earlier than Bark and is forecasted to do $7 billion of revenues in their FY2021 with a current market cap of $42 billion. As of Fridays close, $CHWYs stock price is now up 245% YTD for 2020. $CHEWY's revenue growth is expected to decline from 45% YoY in their FY2020 to 25% YoY in their FY2021. Throw in their 25% gross margins and its easy to see why I think $BARK could be the better growth stock going forward.

Not that I ever invest in companies based on the potential of them being acquired however that is a real possibility for $BARK. I can think of at least 3-4 companies that could be potential acquirers in the future -- $CHWY, $AMZN, $WMT and $TGT just to name a few.

 I'm not saying that $BARK is going to be the next $CHWY because they are very different companies with very different business models but it does show how large the opportunity is for pet focused e-commerce and omni-channel companies especially ones that put a priority on making the customer happy.

Title: Cloudera, the best cloud play on the market ($CLDR)
Alright boys. Listen up to some pristine DD. Cloud's real hot right? Cybersecurity is real hot right?

In comes Cloudera. The most obvious of plays. Currently sitting well below the IPO price this little guy has the potential to make you a retarded millionaire and let me tell you how. 

&amp;#x200B;

Where are clouds? In the sky. What else can be seen in the sky... the moon.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you need to know more? Probably not. Do you want to? Nope.

&amp;#x200B;

In all seriousness, I believe they are entering a super cycle with rising indicators. Check the charts for yourself on the long time frames, but they are poised for a break out within the next 3 months. The cloud, cybersecurity, and IT management solutions time is now because of the Solar Winds Fiasco. This should create a catalyst that pushes it forward. They also have a rising EPS. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's the juicy bit:

The calls are cheap. Dirt cheap. You can pick up 3 month long calls for 0.2-0.5 cents for maximum OTM and this really does have the potential to reach $30+ given it has only a $5 B market cap right now. It also has a 4 days to cover the shorts so there's some potential for a short squeeze if all goes well. 

Disclaimer:

My position is ($CLDR) 2/19/21 800 calls, 25$ with plans to add about 800 more. YOLO

Title: It's just about time - ARCELORMITTAL - STEEL GANG

Here with your daily update on the steel situation. Get your shit packed because we're heading to the moon for some juicy fucking tendies Q1 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

Because I can't put it into better words myself, here are some direct quotes from the article:

&amp;#x200B;

**Quotes of the day**"Availability remains extremely limited," one sheet consumer said. "There is so little spot HRC available that the price just pretty much changes on each shipment."

Said a service center source: "For the first time in the history of our company, we have submitted steel orders with no pricing on the orders. We are being told to place orders, to hold the production time and we will be told of the pricing shortly. In the short term, I believe there will be hurt feelings between suppliers and customers." 

And a second distributor said: "Mills are so far behind, I think they dont want to overcommit on an already robust book. We see no chance for a breather on pricing until March. Crazy end to a crazy year."

&amp;#x200B;

$MT's PT continues to receive upgrades from various investors with each passing day. We're seeing all-time highs with respect to the price of steel. Unfortunately for those who need it, steel is expensive and in high demand - but this is fantastic news for us fucking autists.

Historically, we're seeing some of the lowest interest rates being offered by banks and these rates are likely to stay until 2023. This bodes perfectly as infrastructure projects are all financed (who the fuck has $10B in cash to complete a construction project!?!?!).

Either way, I'll shut up and post my position:

Title: AMC - A dead Phoenix.
AMC is currently down -91% in year over year revenues.  


Theaters are about to open up again, and they're all booked out over Christmas season.  


" In the company's 2019 fiscal year, AMC Theatres reported annual revenues of over 5.47 billion U.S. dollars.  "  


Which means in this recent year they got rid of the dead weight, only made 500m dollars, restructured.  


They suspended the dividend.  


All in all, when AMC recovers its revenues this q or next with covid opening its moon-time.  


$10 AMC coming shortly,  


AMC JAN 2022 $10c  


BONUS:  People are afraid it's going to go bankrupt, but it won't because BRRR stimmy boi coming to prop its bottom up.  They have already earmarked 15bn for theater business with recent stimmy; and more to come with the next one Biden boi promised.  


TLDR:  MOON AMC JAN 2022 $10c MOON (unless you're a real man then $22c jan 2022.)

Title: Sprouts Farmers Market DD- Calls
Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) is a healthy grocery store that has made healthy living accessible to shoppers by offering affordable, fresh, natural and organic products.  Their slogan is healthy living for less.

Over time they have been slowly growing and have around 356 stores and approximate they will continue to add around 20 stores each year (based on their last quarterly report). The CFO said that at a minimum they will continue with a 10% annual unit growth rate. 

They are able to keep their costs low due to strategic distribution centres and they mostly self distribute their produce. They will be adding more distribution centres in 2021 to cut down costs even more and improve efficiency as they grow in scale.

Sprouts has had tremendous growth with an average revenue growth of 12.9% and net income growth of 16.2% per year for the last 5 years (including the last earnings report).  Their balance sheet looks good in terms of the grocery store business. One thing to mention when you look at their financial statements is that they had a sudden increase in long term leases and property plant and equipment (PP&amp;E). This is due to a change in accounting policy and is nothing to worry about.

How has COVID-19 impacted Sprouts? First of all, they have had more sales and CEO, Jack Sinclair said Our e-commerce business grew 337%, outpacing most e-commerce growth rates in the industry. We ended the quarter with e-commerce representing 11% of our sales. Our gross margin increased 400 basis points versus last year.. However, the best part that COVID-19 has done to Sprouts is accelerate its 5-year goal of creating a highly profitable, differentiated specialty grocer with a long growth runway.  They have not had much of an emphasis on marketing, but have still accumulated a few millions of followers on social media. They have developed a strong brand that integrates sustainability with supporting farmers, their society, etc while offering lower prices on organic produce than any other grocer. 

With this strong brand proposition, they plan to expand their efforts on marketing since COVID-19 has accelerated their goal (mentioned above) and want to implement a loyalty program in the near future. Who doesnt love more deals and saving money, right?

In addition to this, the CEO is relatively new (under 2 years) and has plenty of experience in the grocery sector with being an executive vice president of the U.S. Grocery Division of Walmart. 

With the current trend of wanting to be healthier and being frugal at the same time, this is another catalyst that differentiates Sprouts Farmer Markets from other grocery stores. 

Did I forget to mention that they brought in revenues of 6.231 billion and only have a market cap of 2.38 billion!

Title: JIH? Tendies to be made??
Like most of the autists in this sub I'm not a huge fan of doing my own DD and I'm looking for some insight into JIH.

I was going through a list of SPACs and JIH really jumped out at me. It's up just over 6% today and has hit an ATH. The main thing that stood out to me though was the volume. It has an average volume of under 200k yet today traded over 8m shares.

Can anyone provide some info on this and if it is worth a play. Tendies or no tendies?

Title: AAPL EV is good for Tesla
**Unless any of you gains think that another electric vehicle company is going to be able to produce higher quality cars at a lower cost than Tesla which I think is exceedingly unlikely, then all news of competitor electric vehicles should be treated as a positive. Heres why: **

Dominating the electric vehicle market right now is far less important than hastening the transition to an electric automotive market. Every electric vehicle that comes out , Especially if an Apple vehicle comes out, normalizes the concept and reality of electric vehicles for the American consumer. It makes them more comfortable with it. Big brand names with consumer trust like the legacy auto manufacturers and Apple instill confidence in electric vehicle purchases for the average American.  

**Therefore, if tesla can retain the edge and remain the best electric vehicle manufactured at the lowest price, they stand up from facilitated American adoption of electrical transport.**

Currently, tesla enjoys that very same status. Tesla reigns supreme within the electric vehicle sector right now. I think that is likely to stay 

- The manufacturing advances they are making with the model Y (casting machine) and the cybertruck, (folding chassis) and The new battery design, which is designed in order to enable very cheap, mass manufacturing, are unlikely to be challenged by any electric vehicle competitor from a cost basis. Tesla is going to source its own raw materials for batteries for the most part, whereas their competitors are going to have to buy from third-party. 

- unlike other car companies, Tesla doesnt have entrenched unions, it doesnt have colossal amounts of debt, it doesnt have an entrenched dealership network opposed to electric vehicle adoption.

- unlike Apple and other electric vehicle start ups, tesla already has brand name recognition, a Pan-American repair and delivery network

- Tesla technology lead to pack right now. People have been saying for years that a Tesla killer was on the horizon. Currently not exists. Tesla had the first mover advantage of moving from a luxury, to semi luxury, to main stream car in order to facilitate their growth. Other companies dont have this luxury, they have to produce a car competitive with the model Y and the model3 immediately, but without the strong internal engineering capacity while having to source parts including batteries and components from third parties. 

**I genuinely dont see a path to success for competitors outside of smaller niche market like small transport, vans, traditional truck designs, that sort of thing. I think Tesla has such a lead at the moment, that they are in the process of juicing the most out of capital expenses, their technology is so far ahead in terms of efficiency and cost, that they absolutely stand to benefit from competitor vehicles.**

In fact, I think the worst case scenario is that the entire auto sector ignores Tesla and continues business as usual, not normalizing electric vehicle ownership and letting Tesla be lord of a little kingdom rather than a prominent player in the entire auto sector.

One thing you guys need to keep in mind is that the current share price is, obviously, directly tied to future sales estimates. I genuinely think these are conservative. If the transition to an electric car market is hastened for the majority of Americans, and test the remains number one, the current number projections are exceedingly low. Especially when you factor in the profit margin on Tesla insurance, full self driving subscription, among others.

Title: The next charging station play. DON'T SKIP.
(T.P.G.Y.)

So we all know about Chargepoint and Blink by now - this can be reflected in their outrageous SP - both trading in the 40's. I currently hold both and will continue to hold for a VERY long time as I view this as a similar play to buying gas in the 60's and 70's. 

Somehow, a THIRD charging station stock has silently slipped through the rafters and is just now really gaining some traction (compared to it's charging station brethren). This is a company by the name of **EVBox**. These guys are the current charging station leader in **EUROPE.**

[https://blog.evbox.com/7-faqs-ev-charging](https://blog.evbox.com/7-faqs-ev-charging)

Not too long ago, the ticker mentioned above silently released the news and saw a parabolic increase in price in the afterhours of the market. This SPAC went from trading in the 10's to the 20's within hours. 

Now, this being a SPAC, everyone expected this crazy price action to correct itself and consolidate in the mid teens. But it never did. The lowest this dropped to was the 19's and then proceeded to consolidate in the low 20's. It's currently trading around $27.30 a share.

I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A HIGH PREMIUM FOR A SPAC. BUT.

I don't believe we will see it drop any lower than 25. The market is gradually finding out about this and- if it follows the path of it's competitors, Blink and Chargepoint, I believe this price range will be very short lived. You can argue that the SP has some major growth ahead as it becomes recognized as the major player that it is.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE FACTS**

* **2020 Revenue: $85 Million**
* **Projected Growth in 2021: 72%**
* **Charge Ports Delivered: 190,000 (38,000 more than Chargepoint)**
* **Charge ports Delivered in 2020: 80,000 (48,000 more than Chargepoint)**
* **CURRENT MARKET LEADER IN EUROPE**

&amp;#x200B;

The last fact is very important. These guys are the current leader in Europe for charging stations. 

They have recently announced a partnership with Chargepoint as well that will allow drivers to roam between the two stations.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.chargepoint.com/about/news/chargepoint-and-evbox-pave-way-fully-electric-future-forward-thinking-partnership/](https://www.chargepoint.com/about/news/chargepoint-and-evbox-pave-way-fully-electric-future-forward-thinking-partnership/)

&amp;#x200B;

I've loaded the boat at an average of 25.00 and expect it follow the price action of Blink and Chargepoint.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq56ax8xR3Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq56ax8xR3Y)

TLDR; So, once again, my main argument is that this is currently undervalued thanks to the massive spotlight on Blink and Chargepoint. I expect EVBox to have a similar growth pattern as the market slowly discovers this hidden gem. It's the current charging station leader in Europe and has an agreement with Chargepoint. I own all three. 

**Chargepoint SP: $43.18**

**Blink SP: $47.05**

**EVbox SP: $26.96**

Title: CHGG DD
If youre on tiktok you may have noticed all the posts about Chegg. If not, go search for them.

Basically, Chegg is used pretty much exclusively for cheating. Students post entire exam questions on there to solicit expert answers. 

Recently some professors mustve discovered that they can contact Chegg and get the info of everyone who viewed an answer on Chegg, who posted the question, IP addresses, etc. This because in Cheggs terms of service, they say they will release user data if it pertains to a university investigation. They can literally tell the professor who *viewed* a post. 

Now theres basically been a huge wave of cheating scandals all over the country and Chegg underlies many of them. On TikTok theres this whole Chegg is a snitch movement where students are cancelling their subscriptions in huge numbers. If you studied engineering in college, you know that people only use Chegg to cheat, and now that that utility has been compromised, nobodys gonna use it. Buy CHGG puts. Im eyeing the feb 19 contracts, which will occur after their earnings.

Im on my phone so I dont feel like pulling up the sources but just look this shit up. Its real.

Title: Opendoor DD (OPEN)
I'll try my hand at this analyst nonsense. Please tell me how wrong I am in the
comments. Love you.

# Opendoor

TLDR  1/15/21 $35+ calls

Is an online real estate marketplace. It acts as the market maker by providing
cash offers for sellers to take their inventory without a listing. It then
takes the property on its books and then sells it. They're basically an
institutional house flipper.

Since 2014, they've flipped [80k houses][1]. During 2019 it sold close to [19k
homes][2]. Revenue grew from $0.7B in 2017 to $4.7B in 2019. Read more in their
[S-1][3].

They listed on NASDAQ 12/21/2020 through the IPOB SPAC from ya boy @chamath.

## Financials

### Private funding rounds

1. 8/27/2014  $10M (lead by Koshla Ventures)
2. 2/26/2015  $20M (lead by GGV Capital)
3. 10/14/2015  $80M at $500M (lead by Access Technology Ventures)
4. 12/1/2016  $210M at $900M (lead by Norwest Venture Partners)
5. 6/13/2018  $325M at $1.7B
6. 9/27/2018  $400M at $1.6B (lead by SoftBank Vision Fund)
7. 3/20/2019  $300M at $3.5B (lead by General Atlantic)

### Private debt

1. 1/24/2018  $135M

Total private funding  $1.48B at $3.5B valuation.

### Public funding rounds

This is a little hairy, because it's a SPAC merger, but I believe the company
received $1B in cash at $4.8B valuation to complete the merger.

As of this post, OPEN was trading on NASDAQ at $29.42 with a market cap of X

### Margins

They have a 1.9% margin for the whole company, but various
individual markets have higher margins (Pheonix has 3.0%). This means there's
room for margin expansion. Let's say to 4-6% as per their
[analyst presentation][4].

## Valuation

With their 2019 revenue of $4.7B and a +159% compound annual growth rate, if we
skip 2020, 2021 should have $7.5B in revenue and at 4% margin we get $300M.
With all of the other bullshit P/E ratios in this stupid bubble market, even
though OPEN is currently not posting EBITDA profits, this is easily a $30B
company.

Mind you, the company is projecting $3.5B for 2021 and $6.2B for 2022. With
those numbers, it's more like a $15B company.

## Price Target

For Q1 2021

Conservative  $40
Autistic  $60
Retarded  $69

## Disclosure

I own OPEN shares and calls.

Title: $BB Insider trading  Unusual options activity on weekly 7.5cs  checks all the boxes for an insider trading on news leak coming this week!!!
Full disclosure: I have a large open BB position thats bled since earnings, so Ive been watching the chart like a hawk 

I noticed today a large position of $100k+ worth of weekly 7.5 calls purchased. 

Open interest was roughly 8K, the volume on that trade was roughly 11K. Definitely unusual for a weekly play...

Now, theres only one way to check if unusual options activity trades are opening or closing trades versus the open interest, you either wait till the next day for the trades to settle, or you check the stocks minute chart at the time the options were bought 

Look at the minute chart today for BB at 11:11 time stamp, theres a huge volume push and stock price shoots up

What that means is this, whoever bought those calls exposed MMs to $8 million worth of naked short stock positions. MM will always hedge, almost instantly in these situations, therefore they begin buying $8 million worth of stock to hedge against whoever bought those calls. You buy a call from them, they buy the stock. Thats how options work. Stocks randomly pump this way and then drift back to the days normal movement exactly what happened here. 

Those calls were 100% a buy to open trade this afternoon 

$100k is low enough to be an insider trading on info leak. Especially considering they expire on a short trading week. It could also be an autistic gambler. Someone knows something or someone is being super retarded. There is no in between here. 

Its not a short hedge fund. Funds will not randomly hedge an 8 million short position with weekly contracts. Someone is betting big for some strange reason 

Remember when WSB was jerking off to tracking insider trades earlier this year that a private group formed to follow these trades? I was in it along with others and learned quite a bit about the mechanics of insider trading 

This literally checks all the boxes to be an insider trading on a news leak 

BB catalysts ppl are waiting for are either patent sales, FB settlement, more AWS IVY news... or something totally unpredictable 

Putting this out there just so I can say I told you so if theres news this week. Textbook insider trade. Someone will get in shit for this, they were not discreet whatsoever!

Title:  Are Fuk GME and market will  
New stim bill coming and all these retarded kids are getting money from Christmas meaning they will do the same thing we are, spending it all on Robinhood. The kids that don't do that will go to Gamestop and blow it on extra controllers for their moms boyfriend. Buy calls on everything.

Title: BTWN Peter Theil SPAC
Peter Theil (crowd goes wild) has a SPAC , Bridgetown Holdings, that intends to bring a company public in Asia. Rumor has it he's gonna target Tokopedia, an Indonesian e-commerce company. Very new SPAC, already down Substantially from IPO. This is about as deep as SPAC DD gets. Pre announcement, solid rumor, at a discount to IPO. And The Crowd goes wild.



Positions: Shares. Hold forever.

Title: Partnership leak?
This flashed on my screen as I was watching market updates. Not sure how legit this is. This would be amazing. Tesla has to do something to fight back against Apple's iCar press that is tanking the stock.

Title: TMO to the moooon
Hey autists, first time poster, but long time gambler and fellow autist. 
Let me cut to the chase: I work for a biotech company doing Covid-19 tests, and Thermo Fischer supplies nearly 90% of all our consumables. Most importantly, the Taqpath for the RT-PCR test, that costs 1000s of $$$ per bottle, we go through like a fat man left alone with a 20 piece nugget. 
Now the company I work for has labs across the country, that all use the exact same SOPs and consumables. After contacting some friends in other companies doing covid tests, the taqpath is surely the leading method for RT-PCR Covid tests. 
With covid testing at all time high currently, and only going to continue to rise, what company with fingers in almost every covid testing site do you think is going to moon this quarter? This year TMO hit a high of 530, so there's plenty of room.

TLDR: TMO 510C 2/19/2021

Title: CFII - Ride the merger up - possible deal with Tesla?!
Just thought I'd share a little DD with you all on this under the radar.

They're merging with View. - a market leader in next-gen smart windows that use AI and machine learning which will tint the glass to optimise natural light while controlling heat and glare to enhance mental and physical well-being...this includes buildings and CARS....who else but Tesla will have a deal with them very soon. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Merger value $1.6 Billion
* Merger date Q1 2021, exact date TBC
* Company est. revenue $60m
* Largest smart window manufacturer
* *Already* have &gt;$1 Billion funding
* Already producing products

I say don't be the one to miss the train..it luckily hasn't taken off yet. Solid buy -  Minimal risk right now. To buy a SPAC that's going to merge under $13 is a no brainer. They run up past $20 on the run up, just have patience. So many examples to give...QS, VLDR, PIC, LAZR, PSTH, etc. Just play the merger build up. 

Good luck!!

Title: Big Rock Partners Acquisition will give you big cock tendies!!! BRPAW DD inside 
Long time lurker, GME PLTR DM bag holder, first DD. I never imagined my first DD would be a warrant arbitrage play, but this is 2020. Ive got something gay bears and big ball bulls will like. Big Rock Partners Acquisition (BRPA) is about to give you big cock tendies. 

What is BRPA you ask? Its a SPAC set to merge with NeuroRx, Inc. is a clinical stage, small molecule pharmaceutical company which develops novel therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 (RLF-100 or "ZYESAMI (aviptadil)") and Bipolar Depression (NRX-100, 101). An article recently came out that COVID ICU patients survival rates tripled on this drug.  https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/neurorx-and-relief-announce-initial-successful-results-from-expanded-access-use-of-rlf-100-aviptadil-in-patients-with-critical-covid-19-and-severe-comorbidity-72-survival-seen-in-icu-patients-301179820.html

Do you need to know anything beyond that? No. Do you care are about anything beyond that? No. Should you? Maybe.  

Whats important to note is the stock is at ~$52 rn. The warrants, BRPAW are at ~$7. You can exercise the warrants post merger into stock for 11.50. For all you retards out there this means should remain approx $11.50 below the stock price. Thus, these warrants are severely undervalued. This is because of extremely low float. Well shouldnt I go balls deep in warrants then? I did very happily did, but there is a potential drawback. The majority of commons got recalled. They have an extremely low float. That's why the stock price is so disconnected from the warrant price.

When warrants can be excised, they will dilute the stock. Which will have a big impact, because they will increase the float by a lot due to the recalled shares. The warrants price in an unusual amount of dilution.

Don't hold them until after the merger. So gay bears, even if the stock is getting pumped  and may be overvalued and will come crashing down to $18, the warrants value is still solid. In that case, you dont stand to lose all that much money.

If stock price stays flat we are talking 500% gains on the arbitrage. 

TLDR: long BRPAW - short term play
Position: 1K warrants

Buy TSLA buy TSLA buy TSLA. TSLA rocketship. TSLA to the moon (for the algos)

&amp;#x200B;

Ok so anyone remember how the dot com bubble burst? 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Yahoo got added to the S&amp;P500 and jumped 50%+ on the news
2. Y2K was over, so there was no longer an immediate catalyst driving tech up

&amp;#x200B;

What's happening now?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Tesla got added to the S&amp;P500 and jumped 50%+ on the news
2. Covid's almost over, so there will no longer be an immediate catalyst driving tech up

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to that, Apple's making electric cars. This is going to be enough to burst the bubble. Luckily, Tesla isn't a shit company like Yahoo. Tesla won't die. But it's crazy-high valuation isn't sustainable. Look for a drop back to $400 (where it was before the S&amp;P announcement), at which point greedy institutional investors will pile back in looking to pump &amp; dump it back to retail

&amp;#x200B;

Positions:

&amp;#x200B;

Put spreads on TSLA until it hits $400

Title: $LUMN - future of tech play with 10% dividend, large moat, Burry ownership
We all know that Dr. Burry bought into Lumen Technologies (formerly Centurylink) sometime earlier this year, and there are some rumors that Daddy Buffett might be accumulating a position. We all know what Burry does his research, so what makes them an attractive investment?

Pros:
10%+ dividend (probably would be better off reinvesting though)
Current dividend payout is under 40% of FCF, 75% of Net Income
Interest rates to remain low, allowing most of their debt &gt;6% to be refinanced
Once another 30% of debt is paid down, can return to investment grade status and reduce rates to below 3% and continue paying down
Revenues have stabilized in core businesses, recent growth in enterprise segment
Huge competitive moat with fiber assets
Biggest competitive threats (Starlink, 5G Internet) unable to replicate bandwidth and latency advantages
5G relies on Fiber backhaul
Data centers and Fiber to Edge enable next generation tech
Partnerships with Zoom and other tech companies show new path
Insiders hold large stakes, include their CFO, Neel Dev.

Cons:
CEO (Jeff Storey) is a boomer who doesn't understand emerging technology, would rather milk the company for his own gain until retirement vs take necessary risks
Huge debt pile from acquisition of CEO's former company, being paid down but dragging on the business
Landline business dying, but still has to be supported due to government rules and there aren't any takers
Never invested in a wireless service, missed out by selling to Verizon
Debt repayment and dividend limit investment in R&amp;D

If Storey leaves, this stock goes up 50% overnight, and I hope that investors will demand this. Even if he does ride things out, they are at least setting up the next management for a cleaner balance sheet to fully take advantage of their fiber and data centers.

TLDR: This boomer-infested utility could become a real tech player and enable the next industrial revolution, get paid a nice 10% dividend while you wait for the boomer leadership to retire.

Title: Why Gamestop earnings makes sense and this dip is the perfect time to buy. crosspost from my sub /r/GME_Stock
 

For one Shorts love to meme this stock hard af, everytime there is a sharp increase they increase their short stake massively, usually in after hours there is a big increase in value coming from shorts being limited and no news but last earnings report showed how a normal fucking earnings call can put a damper on greedy yolos, Gamestop has been increasing EPS massively for the past 2 quarters by closing down unprofitable stores and increasing online sales optimization doing basic divison of the 250% increase in online sales and the 25% decrease in store sales everyone can see that online sales are a 10th of what store sales but another quarter of this means big positive news.

My final bull case for this stock is the fact that huge jumps in value usually result from catalysts and the best catalyst is upgradings of price action by financial firms this happened with nio multiple times and with xpeng, and i think seeing the profitability increase by 2x coming out of the coronavirus pandemic alot of financial valuing firms with see this and massively upgrade this stock based on it.

My positions are 40 calls expiring 12/31

and 20 calls expiring april

Title: Why a $150 price target for GME is realistic
Todays 25% move upwards was pure authentic buying. According to \[iborrowdesk\]([https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)), shares available for borrow did not change at all today. This shows 2 things.

&amp;#x200B;

 Firstly, the institutional shorts like BOfA and melvin have yet to cover, yet are getting pushed further underwater. When/If the squeeze eventually occurs, it is going to be violent. This also shows that the price dips at the 19 range was not a short attack but rather weak hands profit taking. 

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, a big player is accumulating. Either its Cohen trying to increase his stake for takeover(hell have to report within 2 days), or another institution buying. Either way its bullish.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, heres the important part. Take a look at this chart, paying attention to the red crayon marks.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5i6dco7lqr661.jpg?width=3038&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d2c3e40eb68b649d7d8b42eb6acff2ad4f3a970

Before every console season, some idiots start shorting GME, resulting in a mini short squeeze in 2008 and  2014. At its peak, it had a share price of about $64. Now, take a look at how much higher the short interest is, and how much lower the float (total number of shares issued) is. Accounting for the same peak market cap, this gives a conservative estimate of $150 if the squeeze occurs. Note that due to the significantly higher short interest, it may very well exceed 150 by a mile.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, for the short squeeze to occur, we need to all stop being paperhanded bitches. stop fucking selling at a 20% gain when u can easily get a 10x gain. The more liquidity u give to shorters, the less violent the short squeeze.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: GME to $150 provided people stop being paperhanded hoes.

Title: XPEV 55 Call 04/16/21 to the MOON 
Easiest (and first DD of my life so wish me luck bois). I found this AI options analysis thing and its been pretty much right most of the time which blew my mind. And then it said XPEV 55 Call 04/16/2021 as one of its picks today so yah know what time it is.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR for you idiots who can't read two sentences:

XPEV 55 Call 04/16/21 to the MOON cuz artificial intelligence says so.

Title: CIIC arbitrage opportunity update + vote date announced
11 days ago I posted about an arbitrage opportunity and a potential 180% gain by holding CIICW over CIIC. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kanwe9/potential\_180\_gain\_ciicw\_is\_undervalued\_relative/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kanwe9/potential_180_gain_ciicw_is_undervalued_relative/)

They announced a merger vote date, December 28th. This vote will definitely pass. CIIC shares are up to 30$ and have been stable in that area. Management at Arrival has voted in favor of the merger, so it's just a matter of waiting.

The vote is in 6 days. Once it passes, the warrants should jump to trade in line with the share prices.

I initially told you guys to buy in at about 7$/warrant (CIICW), they stayed around 6.50-7.50$ range until today, they're now up to 8$. The intrinsic value of these warrants is 18.50$ at the moment (30-11.50) This is a gain of 131% from here.

I've doubled my position, up to 4000 warrants this morning.

This is a pretty high likelihood of a double or triple in a week. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another option: short CIIC, buy CIICW.

TLDR: Buy CIICW.

Title: NASDAQ: FTNT
**Irrelevant Intro:** I thought I'd kick this off with the first play I've ever made *entirely without outside suggestion or analysis.* That might make you wonder why you should even read this to begin with, because I am very clearly *not* a professional, but god damn do I love analysis and stock picking. 

**Actual intro:** Fortinet, no not Fortnite, is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Sunnyvale, California that develops and markets cybersecurity products and services, such as firewalls, anti-virus, intrusion prevention and endpoint security. I ripped that description straight from Wikipedia, but it's important to note that a hobby, not profession, of mine is cybersecurity. Over the last few months reading various books, content here, and yes, digging into technical trading too, I finally decided I was ready. The only problem was, I didn't know where to start- this is where FTNT comes in. 

**I need to be clear here, the analysis I did for FTNT was done at the end of November. It's been about 3 weeks since this analysis so the valuation of the company *has* inherently changed.** 

**Why Fortinet?:**

Ultimately, my decision to buy into FTNT came from wanting to invest in the Cybersecurity industry. Yes, there are ETFs for this that spread out risk over a number of players, but I wanted to try and apply the tools I've picked up to real world investing. As I mentioned, cybersecurity is a hobby of mine. It's grown increasingly interesting to me, but more specifically, it's grown increasingly *more important* in today's tech driven world. To me, Cybersecurity is 'the utility industry with upside' because of tech's reliance on it.

Because I wanted something *specifically* within the Cybersecurity industry, I looked into *many* different companies listed in Cyber ETFs or competitors within the space. Specifically, I want to call out Palo Alto as a competitor, but others such as CyberArk, FireEye, and others. It's also important for me to stop right here and mention to you that if you do not know these companies well enough, you will not recognize that they **do not** offer the same products and services as one another. Just because a company is in the same industry as another doesn't mean they operate similarly. 

**Metrics:** 

1. Cybersecurity Industry CAGR:  Somewhere between 8% - 13% over the next few years.

1. ROIC: 19.74% as of Sep 2020, but their last couple of years have been well above my mark for buy consideration. (GuruFocus)

1. Institutional Ownership: 71% of shares held by Institutions, 85% of float held by Institutions. FYI, this was slightly lower during my purchase. I wanted to note institutional ownership for the following reason: The less Institutional ownership, the greater the chance for a significant rise in price after proven profitability comes. (Yahoo)

1. D/E ratio: Pre-pandemic was around 2 and declining consistently. As of end of Sep, closer to 4. I can't imagine the D/E ratio not to drop off over the next couple of quarters. I wanted to mention D/E ratio specifically because of FTNT's in comparison to the rest of the industry. Because the industry is still tech based, high debt is *very* common. The fact that this company, especially 20 years ago, already has a successful track record of obtaining debt for higher returns is especially encouraging when comparing their competitors. 

1. PEG Ratio: At September's end, FTNT's PEG Ratio was .66, however it has increased to 1.16 as of today. Again, this is absolutely *insane* when compared to other Cybersecurity industry competitors. (GuruFocus)

1. There are many other metrics that could be listed here, both in favor of FTNT and against them, but the ones above are a handful that went into my secret sauce when comparing the company against its competitors. 

**Subjective Sentiment:** 

There have been huge catalysts that have helped boost FTNT recently. The COVID pandemic, like most other tech related picks, has definitely boosted FTNT's ability to outperform. The 52 week low of $70 was robbery and unfortunately I was too late to buy in at that point. My actual buy in price didn't come until the stock hit $124 but I'm glad I did, even then. About a week later, it was announced that FireEye was hit by a malware attack, which further exploded into basically what's being referred to as the largest cybersecurity event in the last decade and maybe ever. The implications are reaching as far as the US Gov't, foreign entities, and private businesses alike due to poor cybersecurity practices on behalf of the vendor SolarWinds. I'm not going to get into the details on this attack, but with every passing year, more cybersecurity incidents arise. Hacking is its own industry. Cybersecurity is its opposite. As the hacking industry grows, as does Cyber. This will *not* be a one time thing. If you are too concerned that you 'missed out' on a significant event and shouldn't even consider FTNT, you're gonna keep missing out on what Fortinet will continue to prevent against.

What I think is the most important piece of this short novel is the sentiment behind the company itself. I am not a FTNT customer, so I was unfamiliar with their level of success from the customer's perspective. How did I get an idea of the company? Literally just reddit. It sounds insane, but it was tremendously helpful. Subreddits like r/sysadmin and r/netsec was a gold mine for finding out how people feel about both Fortinet, Palo Alto, and other competitors. And guess what, Fortinet was all thumbs up. "Inexpensive and cheap" was the mantra. Palo Alto, you ask? The cream of the crop when it came to the specific solution both companies were trying to solve, but expensive as heck. Even after the fundamental analysis done above, I reasoned that *everyone* needs to start considering Cybersecurity as a part of their core business expenses, but very few but the largest and mid size organizations are willing to put out cash for the "Ferrari of equipment" from Palo Alto.

**Conclusion:**

I could go on and on about Fortinet. It checks all of my boxes and again, it's important for me to say that FTNT is something I'm going to hold for *a long* time. Their leadership is killing it, they're performing when others are still figuring things out, and they still have incredible room to absolutely crush it in the industry. Despite my position being up only 20% since November 30th, I'm absolutely stoked about the potential that Fortinet has in the future.

Please provide criticisms &amp; feedback about FTNT because my strategy is based on examining all possible data &amp; information. It may not be relevant to me now, but keeping it in mind as I move forward with holding FTNT could prove fortuitous if things change. 

*Disclaimer, I am long FTNT and I wish you good luck trying to change my mind.*

Title: New index trend mostly confirmed
I posted a while back on following $AI and $ABNB toward a possible trend for new tech indexes in 2020 that would start to really ramp upwards after options become available and that was definitely the case for AI during which I got paper hands and only got a fraction of the gains I could have potentially made.

Now this is happening with $ABNB and it seems to be paying off only that Im going to maintain some patience and hold for ~30 days. The next target is $WISH which just opened for options trading today. 

I know you degenerates hate straight stocks so this is possible strategy to consider your YOLO magic when everyone here keeps shilling the same stocks and youre looking for something new: new indexes that recently make option trading available.

I do understand that $ABNB and $AI had unique IPOs but are still following the trend and these are just the general samples Im using. Look at any new tech stock or any that act like a tech stock like $ABNB. 

TLDR buy calls on tech stocks that open for options and hold for up to 30 days before plateau

Title: GME search trends
I'm a pretty big fan of Google Trends. I think it's one of the best free ways to do some real time DD. It's flawed in many ways because it's not always clear why people are searching for something. Just because "Ford Cars" becomes a big search term it doesn't necessarily mean that Ford is going to go up, it might mean Ford cars began to explode, etc.

With that in mind, and also bearing in mind this is all *my opinion* on things, here are some of the search trends for GME.

https://imgur.com/a/rDktx4x

Checking the search term "Gamestop Playstation" lets you compare across years. What this chart means is that the search term "Gamestop Playstation" in Nov 2020 is about 400% larger than it has been since 2012. You'll note that the chart includes 2013, the year the PS4 was released.

The bump for Xbox is there but not as huge. It still does beat all of the last 9 years including the launch of the Xbone.

https://imgur.com/a/Jg4rA8g

Hang on because this is where it gets a little bumpy. I have contended that COVID is damping down interest in going to GME stores in person. That's a tough one to tease out of this data but I think you can get a proxy.

First, searches for "is gamestop open"

https://imgur.com/a/rXAsSvt

That huge blue dildo at the end is a break from the past which would normally occur at Nov to Dec, this year it happened starting March. I think you can guess why. But why does this matter?

The next chart is "gamestop trade in" which we know is a big part of their business. You see a spike in 2013 when the last gen consoles were released. Then you see an even bigger spike the year after as people are getting new used games for the consoles they bought the year before. Then a long steady trend down, which makes sense.

Now pay close attention, when did this search term start to plunge way below its trendline, yes right as COVID started. I contend that COVID is suppressing interest in game trade ins and we will see a massive rebound when COVID gets its boot off our neck.

Title: Vaccine Hopes And Dreams Warning - They're Gonna Dump On You
You can estimate antibody half life from how often people are getting reinfected. The antibodies created by the vaccine decay at the same rate. 

&gt;Antibody Half Life: The period in which the radioactivity or number of atoms of a radioactive substance decreases by half; similarly applied to any substance, such as a drug in serum, whose quantity decreases exponentially with time.

All other immune responses induced by the vaccine after the initial antibody boost are the same as after a natural infection.

&gt;Next, the cell displays the protein piece on its surface. Our immune systems recognize that the protein doesnt belong there and begin building an immune response and making antibodies, like what happens in natural infection against COVID-19. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html

Title: While everyone's talking about steel... [PART 2]
Part 1: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/khmlan/while\_everyones\_talking\_about\_steel/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/khmlan/while_everyones_talking_about_steel/)

&amp;#x200B;

Your neighborhood Copper prophet is back to deliver some good news.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, as [u/VitoCorlene](https://www.reddit.com/u/VitoCorlene/) continues to deliver more of his steel prophecies, I think it's appropriate I give you guys some of the more important and juicier DD (scriptures you'll find usually find in [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/)) for you autistic tendies chasing perma bulls. If you refer to my first post, that was just a general/catch-all/scratch the surface type of information **but the bread and butter is in this post:**

&amp;#x200B;

**1) FCX has one of the LOWEST PRODUCTION COSTS within the industry**

"As a mechanical engineer for Asarco, I can tell you that literally everyone is sitting jealous of Freeport. Typical production cost per pound for each mine tend to average around 1.70. Asarco's is about 1.53 but my mine is tiny compared to many of the competitors. **Freeport is sitting at like 1.15.** Thats how they're actually able to be paying off debt and hire up a shitton of engineers to improve their processes."

*\[This valuable piece of information was given to me by someone who directly works in the copper industry\]*

&amp;#x200B;

**2) Biden Administration will be balls deep in solar energy**

"Biden pledged to reverse Trump-era environmental rollbacks and re-empower federal bodies such as the Environmental Protection Agency. His appointment of scores of federal officials  in dozens of energy-relevant bodies, from the departments of interior and agriculture to energy..."

Congress approved a new economic stimulus proposal that includes roughly **$35.2 billion for energy initiatives**

$1.5 billion for new solar technologies

$2.6 billion set aside for transportation technologies

$1.7 billion reauthorization of the Weatherization Assistance Program

Energy-grid technologies get a $3.44 billion boost through $1.08 billion in support for short-term, long-term, seasonal and transportation energy storage technologies and $2.36 billion for smart utility and energy distribution technologies.

$625 million is dedicated to new research, development and commercialization for both onshore and offshore wind technologies

$850 million is being set aside for geothermal technology development

$933 million for marine energy and hydropower tech

$160 million earmarked for hydropower generator upgrades

$500 million pot for stakeholders in industries like iron, steel, aluminum, cement and chemicals as well as transportation businesses like shipping, aviation and long-distance transport that are looking to decarbonize.

$6.2 billion for carbon capture utilization and storage technologies

$6.6 billion in funding for the modernization of existing nuclear power plants and the development of advanced reactors

$4.7 billion for nascent fusion industry

The new energy bill includes a directive to the Department of the Interior to target the generation of 25 gigawatts of solar, wind and geothermal production on public lands by 2025.

&amp;#x200B;

**3) Freeport-McMoRan Has Broken Out of a Large Double Bottom Formation**

https://preview.redd.it/ddyp0efllq661.png?width=773&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c755f7485166aaf2ebfc10417c46354f2d456955

 Prices are in a bullish alignment - in an uptrend above the rising 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line is bullish and so is the MACD oscillator

 **Prices have both broken a major long-term downtrend** and **broken out of a double bottom pattern** when the highs of 2018 were broken. The height of this pattern projected upwards gives us at least a **$35 price target**

Listen nerds, I'm literally handing you a platter of tendies so just fcking take them and treat your wife's boyfriend to a nice post-covid vacation next year or so. I know you're sick and tired of jerking off to your own loss porn while waiting for your next paycheque. **Clearly, I'm on Interstellar's Endurance spaceship with TARS and CASE about to enter a wormhole that'll slingshot me into another galaxy near Gargantua... while most of you nerds are fighting to get on wooden sail boats.**

**TLDR;** Buy FCX May 21/21 calls (27c/30c range); other great (higher risk, higher upside) plays include Hudbay Minerals and Taseko Mines.

Title: Alpine 4 Technologies - Taking over the drone market?
A month ago, I posted telling you retards to buy Alpine :  https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k26o9e/alpp_is_50_today_get_in_losers/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

If you listened to me, a stranger on the Internet, congratulations on your new Lambo and holiday home in the Maldives. 

Yesterday saw a huge rise in share price, mainly down to the US government moving to blacklist DJI, who represent 70% - 80% of the commercial drone market. Full story here: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/amp/news/937108

Today the price will probably go down, as people start to sell to lock in their profits. But it might not. I don't have a crystal ball.  Personally, I bought more at 1.7 because the DD is so strong, Alpine is going to moon all the way into the new year, so I'm not trying to buy the dip. 

Whos all in!? 

Title: AXSM - Make money and help depressed people
AXSM

Ill keep this simple coz it is. 

These fucking muppets have a drug (combination of two drugs) up for approval for Major Depressive Disorder. 

The two pharms used in the their proprietary combo al already approved for use for Depression. 

The safety profile is well known. Doctors are comfortable prescribing these drugs. 

Okay... so wont docs just prescribe these two drugs together but separately and not need to buy (prescribe) the proprietary combo? 

No. Why? Compliance. Compliance to medication is important to Docs and patients for good outcomes. You know who sucks at taking multiple pills? Depressed people. If one pill a day can do it thats far superior than someone having to mix two seperate drugs themselves. 

The research released so far shows improvement above other current conventional used pharmaceuticals. 

They also have other drugs in the pipeline for Alzheimers and some other shit. 

I trade from Australia with a shitty app so I dont have access to options but Im in shares at an average of $73. 

I work in mental health so this is just my insight from that. 

This is not financial advice and I dont know what Im talking about and no I wont help you with you mental health issues. 

Im too lazy to link or reference my statements, do your own research.

Title: SRNE: The stage is set for Sorrento Therapeutics once again - DD Post #1 - The Non-Covid story
**Positions: SRNE** 1/15/2021 $10c  

This post is focused on the non-Covid aspects of SRNE. There are some significant developments on that end as well, which I'll write up later this week. I'll leave you with a little teaser, though - [does this](https://jpeocbrnd.army.mil/docs/default-source/default-document-library/jpm-fact-sheet-surveillance-stick(3).pdf?sfvrsn=55cb2dd7_0) look strangely similar to **SRNE**'s CoviStix, right after they got $37m in funding from DARPA a few weeks ago? Will get to that in the next post...

**DD #1: Pending $1b+ Arbitration: Is it pending, or over and awaiting announcement? See DD2# last 3 cliffnotes...**

Patrick Soon-Shiong (referred to as PSS going forward) was CEO of NantPharma in 2015, and purchased the rights to [Cynviloq from **SRNE**](https://www.genengnews.com/news/sorrento-sells-cynviloq-for-1-3b/) for up to $1.3billion, pending milestones. Shortly afterwards, PSS discontinued development of the blockbuster drug. Why? [Because it benefitted him personally](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/sorrento-sues-soon-shiong-over-catch-and-kill-its-cancer-drug-a-potential-abraxane-rival). 

Tl;dr:

* PSS sells company &amp; Abraxane to Celgene for over $1b in Celgene stock
* Abraxane = success = Celgene stock goes up = PSS net worth go uppies
* Cynviloq = Direct competitor to Abraxane = Bad news for PSS net worth 
* PSS buys Cynviloq from **SRNE**, and halts all progress - aka Catch and kill
* **SRNE** sues for fraud/breach of contract
* PSS tries to get lawsuits dismissed, Judge aint having it and ruled it must go to arb
* $1bill lawsuit + damages on table

**DD #2: SRNE and PSSs fates are still intertwined.** 

Yesterday (12/21/2020), NantKwest merged with ImmunityBio, and NK saw its stock price soar by 60% during the day. Why is this significant? **NantKwests CEO is PSS from DD#1.**

You may be wondering - well, so what, how does that affect **SRNE?** Great question. [**SRNE** owns 10 million shares of ImmunityBio](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/node/11421/html) (Ctrl+F  issued 10 million shares of NantCell). What the hell is NantCell? Ctrl+F NantCell, Inc. (which subsequently changed its name to ImmunityBio, Inc.).

**SRNE** = Significant Shareholder (owns 10m shares, or $160m as of today after the 60% increase) of ImmunityBio. [Open this SEC filing ](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/node/11421/html)and Ctrl+F issued 10 million shares of NantCell

**NantCell = ImmunityBio** (in the same file above,Ctrl+F NantCell, Inc. (which subsequently changed its name to ImmunityBio, Inc.).

 

### SRNEs significant staked company just agreed to merge with the company owned by PSS, a guy theyre in a billion+ dollar arbitration with currently (DD#1) 

Tl;dr:

* SRNE owns 10mill shares of NantCell
* NantCell changed name to ImmunityBio
* ImmunityBio just merged with NantKwest (stock went up 60% in one day)
* NantKwest CEO is none other than PSS, the guy SRNE is in arbitration with
* Reading between the lines, seems like a successful arbitration arrangement will be announced when you consider the filing on October 27th where [**SRNE** voluntarily dissolved agreement to sell up to $250m worth of shares to raise funds.](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/static-files/bef9e5a6-1189-4f20-844b-6d19b4f3a463) Why? Perhaps another source of funds was found? That filing came a couple days after the last meeting in the arbitration case - go to [LA Court Website](http://www.lacourt.org/casesummary/ui/index.aspx), type in these two case numbers: 20STCV08789,19STCV11328. Oh, and the next court date for both is a Post-Arbitration next year.
* October 21: Court hearing for the $1b arbitration
* October 27th: SRNE voluntarily cuts agreement to sell up to $250m in stock

**DD #3: SRNE rejected $7 a share buyout offer when stock was under $1.6 in November 2019.**

On Monday, November 25th 2019, Sorrento released [this PR](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sorrento-therapeutics-inc-received-and-rejected-unsolicited-all) stating that they received and rejected a $7/share buyout offer. The trading day prior, the stock price was $1.60. They rejected a buyout of almost 330% premium because they felt **the offer significantly undervalued Sorrento** and unanimously rejected it. Keep in mind, this was pre-Covid pipeline, so based on their ownership of their IP / products at the time.

**DD #4: Unusual options activity again!**

Back in March, when SRNE was trading at $1.8, I made a thread on r/options asking about [Unusual Options Activity](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/fl38vh/question_about_unusual_options_activity_does_it/). On March 12th, [someone had purchased ](https://imgur.com/a/rwStwJJ)3700 calls 250% out of the money. SRNE a couple weeks later started its infamous run from $1.8 to $19, and our fellow autists learned about it.

Last week, I noticed unusual options activity again in SRNE. This time, [it was 8500 calls purchased for Jan 15, 2021](https://www.optionsonar.com/unusual-option-activity/srne) representing over $400k in volume for that strike/exp. After a little more digging, I noticed today that there was over $1.4m in Jan 2022 deep ITM calls purchased **just today.**

Title: QuantumScape warrants (massive arb)
Hi, long time lurker, first time poster here.

TLDR: If not using Robinhood, buy QS warrant for massive arb opportunity, probably going to close within a month. Hold for a few weeks, make massive bucks even if QS doesn't go up. 

SPACs gets issues as Units, which quickly split between the normal shares, and warrants.
These warrants are typically a 11.5 strike call on the share, and they can only get exercised after the merger with the target company. Minimum 30 days after, in practice a few more extra weeks after that, as the SEC is slow to approve the S1 filing for the merger.

KCAC became QS on November 27th. Which means that QS warrants will become exercisable theoretically as early as December 27th, in reality probably mid-January.

Because Robinhood doesn't allow trading on warrants and probably the lazy "professional" market makers only look at the normal options, this QS warrant is stupidly undervalued.

Even for a "European-style" option that can't be exercised yet, they should still be worth at least intrinsic. Intrinsic value is: share price - strike price.
Here we have QS closing the day at $94.9, strike price $11.5, these should be worth at least $83.4.
They are currently trading for... $27.12.
That's $56.28 too low. We're talking about +207.5% in a matter of weeks.

Alright that's retarded enough. But there's more! When the warrant becomes exercisable in a few weeks, you can just freely take your massively undervalued warrant, message your broker to exercise these, and bam, you end up with the shares, currently worth 3 times as much.
But even if you're worried about operational aspects, worry not my child! One thing the market makers got good at, is on the day these become exercisable, they quickly buy them and erase the arbitrage opportunity. So they will just pump up the warrant back to its correct value and you'll just have to sell it back to them!

So yeah if QS falls back down a bit you'll make less money. With the warrants currently at $27, the share would have to fall back below 27+11.5= $38.5 for you to lose money!

Enough people long QS on this sub. Here I'm telling you that you can triple your money by just not being a massive gay bear in QS. It just needs to roughly not go back down too much and you'll make money. Any gains on the share will eventually get reflected 1:1 on the warrant. Literally can't go tits up!!! 

Previous experience on doing the same on NKLA and HYLN warrants but they weren't even close to that stupid level of being undervalued.

Current positions: long 5k QS warrants. 
(Yeah it's been a good week, but as I made money I realised the potential gains were getting even bigger.)

Title: Vaccine Hopes And Dreams Warning
You can estimate antibody half life from how often people are getting reinfected - a lot. The antibodies in the vaccine decay at the same rate. 

&gt;Antibody Half Life: The period in which the radioactivity or number of atoms of a radioactive substance decreases by half; similarly applied to any substance, such as a drug in serum, whose quantity decreases exponentially with time.

All other immune responses induced by the vaccine after the initial antibody boost are the same as after a natural infection.

&gt;Next, the cell displays the protein piece on its surface. Our immune systems recognize that the protein doesnt belong there and begin building an immune response and making antibodies, like what happens in natural infection against COVID-19. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html

**1)**If it turns out you need bi annual vaccine doses, market is fucked. Its not possible to distribute twice a year

You can estimate antibody half life from how often people are getting reinfected - alot. 

&gt;**Antibody Half Life:** The period in which the radioactivity or number of atoms of a radioactive substance decreases by half; similarly applied to any substance, such as a drug in serum, whose quantity decreases exponentially with time.

All other immune responses induced by the vaccine after the initial antibody boost are the same as after a natural infection.

Title: PSTG - Pure Storage DD. Cathie's Favorite Sleeper.

Alright, I've done my homework on a sleeper stock with serious potential so we can all make some holiday money, treat ourselves, pay some bills and hopefully give back to those in need. Today I peeped Cathie Wood put **675,000 shares**, or [$35M](https://i.imgur.com/xMP9jTV.png) in PSTG today across 3 of her funds, **ARKK**, **ARKW** and **ARKG**, which looks like one of her biggest splurges ever, so I'm feeling even more confident. After seeing this reach 22.5 for the first time since May 2019 and seeing a 52 week intraday high, I figured it was time to get some more eyes on this cyber play.

First of all, I just want to say if Cathie Wood just bought another $35 million worth of PSTG at a price of $22.79 does this even need any DD? I'm long as fuck on this on this point alone, but let's get into it.

Some points about the industry:

* The next generation of primary storage arrays continues to be shaped by NVMe, AIOps, public cloud integration and alternative consumption models. I&amp;O leaders must view future primary storage array investments as foundational to digital business transformation.
* By 2025, at least 50% of enterprises will shift toward operating expenditure (opex)-based storage consumption models, compared to less than 10% today.
* By 2023, at least 20% of enterprises will leverage cloud storage management tools to integrate on-premises storage platforms directly with the public cloud for backup and disaster recovery use cases.
* By 2025, at least 20% of enterprises will adopt NVMe-oF, compared to less than 5% today.
* Our Govt. and Agencies around the world are under constant cyber attacks. The security of information is invaluable and the demand for reliable data storage and securities will grow exponentially, as will the cost.
* In the last year, Pure has continued to innovate and deliver new solutions that solve pressing customer needs.

Pure storage, simply is **high-performance data storage**. They started in 2009 developing software for [storage controllers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_array_controller) using generic [flash storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory) hardware while secretly developing their proprietary software. They completed this in 2015 and went public, raising $470m in venture capital efforts. Now they are a leader in Garnet Magic Quadrant for primary storage arrays in 2020. If you don't know what this means, they're known in the industry as highly efficient, inexpensive and secure data storage.

Some cool examples of their reputation: F1's top team, Mercedes AMG picked them up and has attributed their success to PSTG's tech. The City of New Orleans was victim to an extensive cyber attack in 2019 and PSTG saved the day. PSTG's tech was recently compared to Dell's EMC Powerstore and it wasn't even close. Pure Storage's FlashArray is the shit. When the top entities look for data security and management they're not going to settle for the 2nd or 3rd best option, they're going to the best in the industry.

The run-up for PSTG and many stocks post-election has been the stuff of fairy tales, but I'm not letting that slight me. Sometimes I will turn away from stocks because I think it's too late, but in reality I'm early. I bought CRSR at 25 and sold at 35. Honestly there's no telling how high a company can really run up. All I know is with a market cap of 6 billion, PSTG has a long way to go. The 20% run-up over the last month has been on average daily volume. It looks like institutions have been steadily accumulating ever since Pure Storage established themselves as the best in the industry with the highest potential for growth. Their numbers make me think that they will be bought out by a larger entity soon, because they're basically operating at a net loss, but with huge potential if they can get their costs down. **1.36b revenue in 2019.**

Keith Martin, the Senior Director at Cloud Capacity Engineering had this to say about PSTG:

*Pure has had a revolutionary impact on the business, completely changing our mindset and how the cloud infrastructure team functions. The storage experience freed us up to be more creative. It was a magical transformation.*

Lastly I really like the team. The CEO was a Senior Exec at Cisco Systems. The Chief Technical Officer  was a founding engineer at Veritas, and their Co-Founder served in Yahoo!'s Office of the Chief Technologist. The company is solid, has a ton of new press / clout and is clearly going places considering cybersecurity is probably the hottest sector right now. I am blown away that the volume has been so low so far especially with Cathy scooping up shares all year. I really love how the chart looks with slow and steady bleed up over the last month. I expect a huge pop this week and have a price target of $26.50 by EOY.

Title: CLDR is undervalued tech at $13/share 
Cloudera is turning things around and will be turning a profit soon with their enterprise data biz. 

They dropped 43% when the ceo resigned 1.5 years ago, but  thats ancient history now. Theyre turning a non GAAP profit and will be at GAAP profit soon esp with support for google cloud coming within next few weeks. Google has a large investment in CLDR too.

This stock will make big moves as it turns a GAAP profit and gets considered like other big enterprise tech. It should be already, honestly.

Look at c3.ais valuation for example. That was suppose to ipo around $40 and instead opened over $100. The public is thirsty for big tech,  especially in the cloud, AI/machine learning. cloudera is just under the  radar at the moment because they got off to a rocky start.

Palantir isnt making a profit and you guys are crazy for it. Can't get enough of it. AND I'M WITH YOU. GET IN ON THIS SHIP NOW TOO. Palantir was also $13 once. 

Fastly isnt making a profit and theyre being valued 8x as much as cloudera in a competing biz. Its a complete market inefficiency right now.

Currently CLDR is trading 27% below ipo price (3.5 years ago) and trending up (+13.88% in the past month).

&gt;Currently, Cloudera only offers two application services atop its  private cloud offerings, including data warehousing and machine  learning. For its public cloud offering, it offers those two services,  plus data engineering. But that will soon change, Koopmans said. We have a couple of services that are on the cusp of being  launched, he said. The Cloudera Operational Database \[i.e. HBase\] is  launching early next year. And the DataFlow experience is launching soon  after that. Thatll come out in the public cloud, and later it will go  to all the different public clouds, as well as on prem.

Title: VLDR (
 Something something about cornell university saying Lidar isnt required in autonomous cars...

Boomer in the comments:

If Musk changed his mind and said LiDAR is the future then every single person that rails against LiDAR would change their tune too. The argument is not about science. Its tribalism. Waymo uses LiDAR but it also uses cameras, radar, and microphones. And Cornell isnt even claiming cameras are better  just that the are almost as good in most conditions. The addition of LiDAR is undoubtedly better. The question then is cost. Waymo is getting into the LiDAR selling business and has brought the cost down from $75k to $7,500. As the cost comes down and the device becomes more streamlined it might see widespread adoption. I dont know the future. And neither does Musk. But right now, the technology is at least marginally better than his best effort and when we are talking about a kid running into the street to grab a ball Id rather vehicles have the marginally better technology. Regulators may agree. And again, costs are coming down so his arguments about the cost are becoming less valid and less relevant. And yes, Telsa has a major advantage in real world conditions. But only with cameras and they have no data on LiDAR so they are not light-years ahead of the competition. Not Waymo. And the fact that some people on here think that Teslas autopilot is more than just branding and that other high end apaptive cruise control isnt the same is scary. Dont treat it like autopilot! I like Tesla. I like electric cars. But I dont like how science is turning into politics. Let LiDAR technology develop and if it works great. No one should be hoping it fails.

Other than maybe people that have a financial interest in Tesla and dont value human life. Also, I dont like that Tesla isnt working harder to try to open its charging network to non-Tesla. Even charging a premium would be fine but dont intentionally stifle EV adoption. Tesla has done the impossible and thats great but it doesnt mean Musk doesnt make mistakes. Look no further than his plan to automate his factories. It failed. But to his credit, he changed positions and admitted his mistake. If LiDAR comes down to sub-$2,000 Id be surprised if he doesnt adopt it. And while Im on an epic rant, Teslas valuation makes no sense to me. I have always thought Tesla would be very successful so it is not that Im betting against them. Its just that if 10 years from now we have self-driving cars it wont make sense to own cars at the same level as today. There will be a decline. And even if Tesla is a leader in autonomous vehicles it doesnt seem possible that others wont be competing in that space considering how evey car manufacturer has invested in adaptive crusie control tech dev (unlike EV which they lagged significantly). And its hard to imagine people will only use Tesla self-driving. Premium will have its place (limos) but people will tend to go with the cheapest functional self driving service  that Im sure about. So the next 5-10 years should be great but at best after that is unknown. At worst, expect car ownership to drop and self driving taxi companies to be a dime a dozen. Too hard to predict which means the value is too high. **The camera detecting autonomous driving systems are like investing in Garmin in the early 2000s because you think navigation systems are the future but ignoring that rise of smartphones with maps. (Smart phones is Lidar for the autists out there that don't get it)**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The above is something i copypasta'd from a boomer. 

There's this technology that companies have been working on for years called Lidar.  There's a few companies that have the price around $10k per system but "that's still too expensive to implement". When firms like GM / Toyota / Volkswagen start funding these companies the tech gets here faster. 

AAPL just said they'll get the best self driving and the best batteries. Kinda seems like they'll contract with QS and VLDR.

VLDR market cap still around $500M. If it gets to the size NIO is, that's a 100 fold return in SHARES. imagine calls bois. TENDIE TOWN

Also, I'd say LAZR is good because it's literally the only competitor but the market cap is higher and company looks like a big fat ol joke.

Title: [CRSR] Catalyst + recent price upgrade by analysts =
**TLDR: ALL-IN on corsair. Ride the wave.**

Corsair is a consumer hardware company. They make money from PC components, Xbox and PS controllers and streaming components so your daughter could show off her mosquito bitten chest for the Chad's on twitch. They basically have monopolized the power supply market for the DIY gamers and is how they've built their brand. Their memory cards are also respectable in the field because memory doesn't compete the way AMD and INTC do for CPU performance. They also make fans, cases, headsets and mice for computers, all of which are starting to become very popular. They acquired SCUF Gaming so they have a foot in the console space, which is going to see the growth that will be off the charts in Q4 and FY2021 as the printer brrrrs and everyone stays home.

My DD will include two of the most important things you should seek: **Catalysts and Undervalued Fundamentals as well as analysts**

And because no one seems to give a fuck about fundys these days, we'll start with

**Catalysts:**

**Generally Speaking:**

* **Gaming is making your fatass, cant-run-a-lap-without-stopping, son cool in school. Look at all the stocks of gaming companies. Hard to find a loser.**
* **Twitch has made it cool to build your own PC**
* **25 day Quiet period expiration expires Monday**
* **Economies of scale and catch-up effect (for my econ majors)**

**Q2 2020:**

* **Two high demanding FPS's** in Call of Duty and Valorant release
* **WFH stipend** employees have been receiving for their WFH conversion; people bought herman millers and your wife's bf built her a new PC with corsair case, fans, PSU and memory cards

**Q3 2020:**

* **Nvidia's 3000 series released in September and sold out immediately.** The GPU is twice as efficient as the next best and for the same price. THIS literally makes people more willing to go big and build a new rig.
* **Valorant** was released in June, so CRSR really starts benefitting in Q3
* **Summer,** which means dad has to buy son the PC he built because that idiot got straight C's in school. I heard they hand out medals for every idiot who participates these days.
* **WFH Stipend** again, as the unemployment rate falls, the amount of money new employees receive increases, incentivizing gamers to build a new PC to watch porn at 240hz ofc.
* **Market realizes the growth in DIY computer builders because of Twitch and WoM marketing. DIY computer builders -- it has been a long time coming.** I built my first computer when I was 15, over 10 years ago. It's easy as lego's and you get more value out of each dollar spent. It is 100% the trend as well.

**Q4 2020:**

* **AMD** releases and **NVDA supply chain** improvement this quarter will make and have made a lot of people orgasm, more so than previous years. The rise of RH trading this year (increases exposure to the brand), all of which means more DIY nerds building PC's to finish the year
* **XBOX release** this year 11/10 will be huge for SCUF gaming (WHOLLY OWNED subsidiary), which makes controllers for the new console. The company's ELITE controllers are sold out online. [https://scufgaming.com/xbox](https://scufgaming.com/xbox)
   * SCUF PlayStation (11/12) controller has not been released yet for the new console
* **Stimulus is finally coming** to all the broke boys, in a lump sum fashion ($5,200-7,800 federally), which means people will SPEND.

**Q1 2021:**

* Will be an **easy quarter** to compete against because the company has been experiencing income growth starting Q2 2020, not Q1.
* **Stimulus payment effect**
* If there's still **no vaccine** by now, holding CRSR will be a great hedge against the market bc as previously mentioned, WFH stipends, PC building and console gaming

**Fundamentals, for my Buffet &amp; Munger enthusiasts:**

**Literally cannot find a cheaper growth stock in the market.**

* 72MM in free cash flow for the first 6 months 2020, with the latter half of the year historically being even stronger. The 6 months was carried by the strong Q2 2020
* 58% YOY growth in sales in Q2 with 22.6MM in income
* Q3 2020 will generate 50%+ sales growth, 35MM+ in income and 50MM+ in FCF (Conservative)
* Q4 2020 will generate 50%+ sales growth, 75MM+ in income and 100MM IN FCF (Conservative)
* 150MM in net income and 220MM+ in FCF Trailing Twelve Month by Q1 2021
   * **I was the Math King in Kindergarten, so don't question my quantabilities.**
* **1.7 Billion market cap**, implying 11x forward p/e and 8x future free cash flow on 50%+ s.g.
   * Logitech is trading at a forward P/E of 20-25 and is worth 13.6 Billion
   * Razer is worth 2.5 Billion and doesn't put up the kinds of numbers Corsair does.
      * **PT estimate: $36-48, but could go to $60 with favorable peer and market conditions**

&amp;#x200B;

The sharp decline of the stock price was nothing more than profit taking. The company itself, Corsair Gaming, continues to be a leader in the Gaming industry with "The new guidance implies revenue growth of 50%-52% compared to last year". Corsair is profitable year after year even beating the first estimated earnings by 0.25, which is more than double the expected.

"Corsairs CEO Andy Paul stated, In our Gaming and Creator segment, we continue to see strong sales in all price points, which we believe indicates that we have both new customers buying gear as well as existing customers refreshing and upgrading".

But with the increasing popularity of streaming and quarantine, "The highest growth continues to be in our streaming products, as gamers want to share video content with their friends and fans".

The positive outlook of this company continues to be a great short term AND long term hold.

&gt;In reaction to the upbeat guidance, Wedbush analyst [Michael Pachter](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/michael-pachter) raised the price target to $49 from $34 and reiterated a Buy rating on Corsair. In a research note to investors, Pachter opined, The pandemic has expanded growth well beyond the normal level, but as growth has largely been driven by new gamers and streamers entering the market, this has widened Corsairs user-base for the long-term, in our view.

Word on the street is that genomics is the new TSLA

My bet of the next 2-5 years is NTRA (Natera)

This company has a proprietary test called Panorama that uses maternal blood draws to test for fetal genetic abnormalities.  It has the most accurate test of all other NIPT tests available in the market.  

ACOG recently recommended Panorama to be standard of care for all mothers regardless of age or maternal risk.  This test is currently not FDA approved.  Many insurers cover Panorama for high risk patients but not low risk patients.  Meaning that once it is FDA approved for all pregnancies, more insurers will cover this test, and revenue will skyrocket.

Title: THINK YOU FOOLS, THE GME DD IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF US
This tweet:

https://twitter.com/DOMOCAPITAL/status/1340047231823581186

was just posted by THE JUSTIN OF DOMO CAPITAL. Now think about the bundle he bought and the games included; NBA 2k21 and Demon souls. You think Justin fuckin plays video games??? He's too busy shitposting on SA about how rich he is going to be. The games are a hint to buy GME NOW. 

A sports game? Sounds like a ecafe transition plan to me. Not to mention the involvement in esports. 

Demon Souls: Rub your remaining braincells together and think about what Demon Souls is about for two seconds. Its about a chosen one coming to save a once beloved land that is now overrun by demons. Sound familiar?

Melvin is giving you undeserving plebs another chance to buy in. Go allin into shares/calls or regret it forever.

Title: GUARENTEED TENDIES in RENEWABLE ENERGY (VST)
Vistra Corp, a renewable energy stock, recently caught my eye and this is a guaranteed 5 bagger but we are looking at up to 10X your money. 

Vistra Corp (Ticker: VST) has recently dipped and now is the perfect time to buy into it. 

Here are my reasons why:

1) Insider Buy: Vistra Corp CFO James Burke buys 17,000 shares

[https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-vst-insider-buying-and-selling-2020-12/](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-vst-insider-buying-and-selling-2020-12/)

This is the first piece of news that caught my eye. Management in the company seems very high on their future and this just confirms my theory. 

2) Insanely undervalued at $17.50 at the moment. Median PRICE TARGET at $31!! &amp; Reasonable PE of 15, compared to their Industry Competitor's Average of 40 PE

[https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/VST/research-ratings](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/VST/research-ratings)

WSJ has 10/12 analysts rating VST as a BUY, and 2 of them have them at a hold. Additionally, VST is trading at a very reasonable price of $17.50, and the LOW for Price Target is at $19, and a high at $34. With a median price target of $31, this stock is guaranteed to rebound  this next year.

3) EXTREMELY CHEAP PREMIUMS 

[waffles.finance](https://waffles.finance) shows leap calls for 2022 and 2023 at barely 2 dollars for a 20 dollar strike price. All premiums for this stock are massively undervalued.

4) Political Outlook

With new president Joe Biden coming into office, the renewable energy sector is poised for takeoff, with companies like Vistra Corp ready to lead the way. You don't need to be a genius to figure out that BIDEN = ENVIRONEMTNAL COMPANIES GO UP

&amp;#x200B;

Now we need to discuss the negatives of this company:

1) They provide dividend.

While the general trend has been that dividend companies tend to not grow as fast as others, Vistra Corp must prove otherwise. 

2) Recent Downward Trend of Price

Recent prices for VST have trended downwards, but with a bright 2021 to look forward to, Vistra hopes to turnaround their recent misfortunes. VST has a market cap of around 8Bil and pulled in 3 bil revenue in the last quarter, with around 5% being net revenue. They show signs of being a strong company with high potential.

Summary: Invest at your own risk and do your own DD but VST is an extremely undervalued stock that is poised to take off in the next year. Buy LEAP calls and go to the moon.

My Position:

Title: GOEV  Canoo 
I make this post because of the times when I read a good DD on WSB and didnt invest and then it mooned hard  (here is my humble contribution to the cause / and I go straight to the points). Also this is no pump and dump and you should do your own investment strategy. But Ive spent multiple hours studying and discussing this case so I thought I might as well share it. I could be totally wrong so use your own brain. 

Company Name: Canoo 

Ticker: GOEV (h c  c as a spac)

Business: EV with their prop skateboard tech which makes developing a new model much easier as you just change the top part like a lego

Why is it better than other EV?:

 they are already have B2B partnerships - we dont know with whom and for how much $$$ but they will reveal it in January so they kept the good catalysts for after their Business Combination (merger with the spac) 

 they going for subscription-only B2C business model (at least at the start) that will yield better margins and more predictable and consistent cash flow. Their 10K vehicles in California are sold out on the paper (but you can still cancel easily).

 CEO is the former boss of EV at BMW and their team is made of former exec from Tesla, QS, etc. 

 marketing and PR is huge just check their insta / they planning collabs for their skins (off-white, bape, etc.) check also their YouTube if you cant read 

 already have a manufacturing deal with Hyundai 

Pump and Dump Risks from the SPAC:

 this is probably the most important point of this play: usually SPACs tend to dip after their merger (business combination or BC) because early IPO investors take their cash and run away but keep their warrants. But the BC was voted today and 99.97%+ of the SPAC shareholders have decided to keep their shares (instead of redeeming them for cash). Which means that as we speak the dilution will be minimal (almost 100% of the cash is still in to back up the shares of the new entity) = 

 the stock is trading sideways today - it could still dip between now and the ticker change but based on the previous point shareholders are staying long so it seems.

 based on these 2 previous points there is a possibility (I have no crystal ball ) that GOEV could trade like LAZR (so basically mooning from the ticker change with a lot of volatility skewed to the upside) (QS type graph would be the dream but lets keep it humble) 

Whats the fair price?:

 based on the companys conservative assumptions, on DCF you got 12.25 - 18.40 - 24.50 (low mid high) and on SOTP you got 35.75 (mainly due to the subscription model). Thats before any potential dilution. And thats based on their August assumptions. In the meantime theyve said they seen substantial growth in consumer demand and significant interest from potential partners (...) and has identified new opportunities significantly increasing its total addressable market in both B2B and B2C

 first analyst (Roth capital) said buy with 30 target 

Downside risks: they are many as for any investment so you better read on Canoo website their 560 pages report and do your own DD  also read that their CEO could be replaced by the Chairman which could suck because their CEO looks so cool and is one of the founder. 

Disclaimer: Im long-biased. This is no advice to buy sell or anything else. 

Also note that the company story has started to pickup by a lot on Twitter only today. You could expect more media coverage from GOEV in the coming days. 

See you at 30+ 

feel free to correct me if youve spotted any mistakes etc.

Title: Potential upcoming Tesla and Google battery partnership
I wasn't sure if this was discussed on the sub yet, but it's about Tesla going to the moon so I hope it fits. Here is what I think will happen:

Tesla has been in the news lately for their grid battery-storage. 

https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/australia-picks-massive-tesla-battery-to-ease-transmission-constraint

Basically, as more countries push for renewable power, there is a need to store excess energy produced when power-usage is low, and distribute that when usage is high. Batteries are quickly becoming the best way to do that.

On the Google side, they are dedicated to powering their data centers with renewable energy, and now have stated they have a goal of removing diesel backup generators from their data center site. While on a test site right now, this could be a framework for the future:

https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/google-alphabet/google-thinks-data-centers-armed-batteries-should-anchor-carbon-free-grid

Here is where it gets good:

&gt;The Google data center team in St. Ghislain will use lithium-ion batteries instead of a diesel generator as power backup for 3MW of live, production computing load  a first for Google.

&gt;A grid powered by renewables could use data centers connected to it to store excess renewable energy and discharge it at times when there isnt enough renewable energy being generated.

&gt;Texier declined to name the vendor who would supply batteries for the Google data center pilot in Belgium, but said the project would use a product that already exists on the market, sold by a pretty well-known entity, one of the leading energy storage integrators in the industry.

Data centers use a metric shit-ton of power, and whoever Google works with will need to be very experienced with batteries and grid-storage - this could be a perfect fit for Tesla. 

From a financial standpoint, if they actually do use batteries to back-up data centers, the installations would be fucking massive, to say the least. Google's new data centers draw 100MW+, meaning Tesla's new 450MWh storage in Australia would only be able to back up a data center for 4.5 hours in a power outage. That definitely wouldn't be enough for Google, who would probably require installations on the GWh scale instead. However Tesla has proven that they have a very scalable solution, and an installation of that size would not be technically much more challenging than what they currently have.

Google data centers already cost [$1-$2 Billion per site](https://datacenterfrontier.com/google-building-more-data-centers-for-massive-future-clouds/), so a few hundred million dollars per battery installation isn't out of the question. That would before the subsidies they would almost certainly get from utilities as well, who will probably be desperate for more grid-storage in the years moving forward as renewables explode.

Granted this all could be wrong, and Google might partner with another company, but face it Alphabet and Tesla are going to be *the* power couple on Wall Street next year.

TL;DR: Tesla and Google are gonna make sweet sweet battery love next year, and we are all gonna benefit

Title: While everyone's talking about steel...
First off, big round of applause to the Steel God u/VitoCorlene, and all his prophets delivering the good news to all the WSB autists. Let's be real, if he didn't pump steel with such conviction you all would probably be twiddling your thumbs like the retards you are while your weekly PLTR calls consistently fucks you unforgivingly. Now I know most of you here are probably: (1) balls deep in $MegaTendies (and its subsidiary plays); (2) bag holding GME until Melvin and those nerds get squozed; or (3) losing money on $DASH puts and are probably refreshing this sub every 30 second with the *'New Posts'* filter as work begins to pile up at your shitty 9-5 work from home jobs.

Call me the new prophet on the block (or a retard) because you fuckers need to really consider $FCX as the next fucking boomer rocket that's going to lift off into Alpha Centauri and give you the tendies you degenerates don't want to miss out on.

&amp;#x200B;

Read the scriptures below nerds:

&amp;#x200B;

**What the fuck is FCX?**

Freeport-McMoran is one of the largest copper mining firms in the world, and one of the few that are American - operates large, long-lived, geographically diverse assets with significant proven and probable reserves of copper, gold and molybdenum. According to their latest earnings, they generated copper and gold sales 7% above their July estimates. They've reduced their net debt YOY and has been able to maintain a strong and healthy balance sheet over the course of this pandemic.

**Copper**

After a small decline of 0.2% in 2019, world copper mine production, adjusted for historical disruption factors, is expected to decline by about 1.5% in 2020 and then to recover by around 4.5% in 2021:

Copper prices are currently at an all time high (look at chart below) and demand for copper will pick up significantly into 2021 as economies start to recover. Like steel, this is a no brainer cyclical economic crash play, and people will always fucking need copper. 

https://preview.redd.it/91u0up2ntk661.png?width=699&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9ed529e67a3c56655ba6c3da2f521da6166e82b

**70% of the world's copper is used in applications that deliver electricity**

* Electric Vehicles (EVs), charging stations, high efficiency motors use roughly **4x more copper** than traditional automobiles
   * We know the EV hype is there and coming into fruition with countries committing to be climate neutral by 20\_\_, there will be even more demand for copper as production ramps up
* Solar panels and associated hardware use copper vs. the traditional fossil fuel power generators
* 5G higher frequency spectrum requires more than 10x the hardware of 4g and there's plenty of associated copper cabling 

**Copper supply takes a long time to ramp up (i.e. getting mines approved, excavation, etc)**  and FCX is in the midst of massively ramping its biggest mine which will roughly double output next year.

Copper is used in building construction, power generation and transmission, electronic product manufacturing, and the production of industrial machinery and transportation vehicles. Copper is an essential component in the motors, wiring, radiators, connectors, brakes, and bearings used in cars and trucks.

**FCX OUTLOOK 2021**

**Volume Growth (2021e v. 2020e)** = Copper 20%+, Gold 70%+ 

**Expanding Margins =** EBITDA/Cash Flows to approximately double in 2021e compared to 2020e  

**Near-term: Laser Focused on Execution** = Continued net debt reduction 

**Sustained growth** in copper demand is expected to continue as **copper is essential to economic activity** and even more so to the modern technological society. Infrastructure development in major countries such as **China and India** and the **global trend towards cleaner energy** will continue to support copper demand. 

Heres some crayon work because some of you believe in this stuff

Title: Everyone has it wrong. This is what $PLTR ACTUALLY does and why it's valuable.
So I had a long conversation with my friend who works in the AI space about Palantir and how you could begin to value their technology. I'll try to keep it concise and simple, but TL:DR; buy 2023 calls right now. Any strike, at any price.

1. Everyone and the financial media has it wrong. If you are reading an analysis, article, or price target revision, and they call it a "Data Analytics Company", you an ignore it entirely.

2. The real value of the company is basically in creating models for algorithms. The model is basically a piece of code that can be implemented into an application. It's essentially the algorithm. A model/algorithm is created by giving it a goal, and inputting a set of data the AI can use to get to the goal more efficiently. 

3. By basically creating an intuitive, easy to use software that Data Engineers can use to create models, they are eliminating the need to build one from scratch. This is a huge efficiency for companies that want to use AI and algorithms to improve their business, software or application. It means that instead of hiring an entire team of Data Engineers, you only need to hire one or two.

If you are having a hard time getting your head around this, here is an analogy:

Say you are a new company that wants to sell tendies online. Are you going to hire a team of developers to code and build a website and entire e-commerce platform from scratch? No. You are going to hire one person, who has a more diversified set of talents, to manage a Shopify site and Shopify template.

This is why Shopify is valuable.

Now, consider the following scenario:

Let's pretend Spotify doesn't exist yet and that you want to create a music streaming service that generates recommendations that increase listening time by using an algorithm. Are you going to hire an entire team of Data Engineers to figure out how to use a massive set of user data to develop a model, or are you going to just use Palantir, and maybe even contract one of their Data Engineers to do it for you, without paying anybody a salary?

Look up the salary of one Data Engineer.

That's why Palantir is valuable. They can benefit anybody who wants to implement AI/algorithms into their software or applications, without the massive investment of hiring Data Engineers to create it from scratch. For years, this has been the "edge" of companies like Google and Amazon, who are at the forefront of AI. Palantir is democratizing this "edge".

I will not be responding to comments from people here saying this is incorrect, because you are all retards and I understand this is a gross simplification. It's also, of course, not the only thing Palantir does. But, I think it is the most scalable in the short-term.

Title:  $AMD 's Lisa Su and her shiny new ARM'ed ROCKET 
Most of you already know INTL CEO [Bob Swan shouldve \*\*\*\*ed a silicone butt](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j6ioot/intel_is_fucked/) instead of blowing old man farts during every earnings call this year.

Now, AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su, who ran the best performing semiconductor company of the past 5 years (+3,242%), is about to rip and tear little Bob "Boomer" Swan a new permanent one.

How will she send him off? Well, here it is, hot off the press: [MSFT is going to transition to ARM for servers and PCs.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/microsoft-is-designing-its-own-chips-for-servers-surface-pcs)

Title: How Banks make money from Gov. Bonds with lower yield than inflation?
This is just my opinion, nothing I can say with certainty. I stumbled upon this stuff while asking the question why are the Gov. Bond auctions overcommitted, although yields are terrible. So I started some digging and here it is:

&amp;#x200B;

**Welcome to the Land of financial engineer-..., Magic!**

1) Some entity needs collateral for (options) trading or any leveraged play.

2) They rent collateral at a bank, because they don't want to own it. (Who needs that low yield garbage anyways?!)

3) The bank says no probs my friend, but we keep the right to re-pledge (=Rehypothecation) the security to someone else.

4) The entity doesn't care as long as they can have the collateral for their play, cuz their homie Jerome got their backs in case of emergency.

5) The Bank can now lend out the same collateral again and again and again and again. (insert Kelly Clarkson song here)

6) If the collateral is to low of quality you can just use your old friend collateral transformation to upgrade the quality of your garbage to pristine quality and lend it out again! ***MAGIC***!

7) $$$

&amp;#x200B;

This can be a serious problem in case of a downturn, which can lead to a collateral shortage and the collapse of the System as we know it. So no worries it won't happen (:

I use a program that a ton of analysts use, and it just updated the fair value of FOUR to $96.18. Analysts will be updating SOON, like this week after they load up, and the price will follow. That's not even the DD though. Here it is  


FOUR is the leader in integrated payment processing solutions. The new fair value estimate came as an average of 2 models, both using DCF growth multiples. 

\*\*FOUR is currently trading at $70\*\*

FOUR marketcap is just 3% of SQ, yet they do 10% of revenue and have a similar YoY Growth. P/B for FOUR is 18.3x meanwhile SQ is sitting at fucking 51.5x. Either of these show FOUR has huge upside, but to use the smaller number of rev/mc discrepancy, \*\*FOUR should be trading at $233\*\*

In another comp comparison, FOUR is just 1.1% of PYPL Marketcap, while doing 3.7% of PYPL revenue. PayPal is so big that FOUR actually has way more expansion and growth available, but ignoring that the revenue/marketcap discrepancy implies \*\*FOUR should be trading at $230\*\*

In a final comparison, FOUR is less than half of LSPD marketcap(Lightspeed POS), but this one is really fucking wild because FOUR does 5X MORE FUCKING REVENUE. This one is probably a tad out of reach and moreso implies that LPSD is overvalued and needs to come down a ways but since we know FOUR is undervalued and we don't know if LPSD is overvalued, we'll just pretend LPSD is properly valued and by the metric, \*\*FOUR SHOULD BE TRADING AT FUCKING $710\*\*

But comparisons aren't everything, CVNA and KMX are an example that investors will pick the more well known/currently hyped name, so the next thing you need to know is \*\*The CEO is a fucking badass\*\* Jeff Isaacman is his name. Forbes has done a few articles about him, the high school drop out that started a payment processing company in his parents basement, sold some equity, bought his old employer and created Draken, the world's largest private airforce, at age 28, whiel still running his POS company, sold Draken to Blackstone for 9 figures, used that to buy out several other payment processors, and is now a billionaire at age 37. Dudes a fucking genius, and because of his strategic buyouts, FOUR now does over \*\*$200 BILLION ANNUALLY\*\* in payments for over 1/3 of the country's hotels and restaurants including KFC, ARBYS, FOUR SEASONS, HILTON, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

One reason FOUR hasn't caught on big is because it hasn't turned a profit as the new entity, but that will all change after this quarter according to the consensus of 7 American IT analysts who agree there will be a final total loss in 2020 before turning a profit of $27m in 2021 and \*\*growing at an average rate of 145%\*\* For the record though, Isaacman's original payment company was turning profit for over a decade. But with all the acquisitions they took on some debt and liabilities from the acquired companies.   


Jeff also still has a 38% stake in the company, meaning he's gonna continue to fucking kill it and we will make tendies in the process. Back to my original point, \*\*I have seen several occasions where my program comes out with models which raise the Fair Value Estimate, and within a week Analysts have raised theirs to nearly identical numbers\*\* This obviously isn't true for all analysts, but I've seen it a bunch. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Positions/Tldr\*\* - I'm in for 1000 shares and have calls at all different expirys up to $110 through 2021. If you're more risky, you can go as far OTM as possible in the next year and you have a real shot of cashing out huge. It's extremely undervalued and when the price targets come out, it is going to go up with a green dick the likes of which have never been seen before

Title: Inseego, the greatest sleeping giant you havent heard of.
For those of you that dont know, Inseego deals with wireless 5G networks. Heres why its a sleeping giant. 

1) They beat their revenue projections this year by 12%. In 2021, they are forecasting $362 million in revenue, which would be a 30% increase from 2020. 

2) Hospitals, schools, businesses, towns, and other entities that need wifi used to use Huawei. After the security concerns, theyve begun to switch to Inseego. 

3) Their software security is state of the art. What just happened in the news recently regarding hacks? Thats right. They are already being used by state governments, seems like the federal government is in the market for fast, secure, 5G wireless solutions, are they not?

4) They have contracts with every major US cell phone provider, and are currently doing the same in Europe and Japan, as well as other places across the globe. 

5) Autonomous cars need wireless communications right? Inseego is already on it. 

6) Daddy Cramer is on board and supports them. Lessens the chance of him cucking you and saying its overvalued. 

7) Bullish Analysts say the stock is undervalued, and should be $17-$20

Youll see a lot more of Inseego in the future, just remember you heard it here first. 


Positions: 500 shares at $9.67

Title: $PLTR  to the ! (and can we bring a Model S with us?)
Trust me, I'm a broke retard so I have to be right?

Palantir and Tesla are brethren. Elon and Alex have spent time in the same womb whether they realize it or not. Even their stock prices follow each other perfectly.

Technical DD: [https://imgur.com/a/OEmlFHn](https://imgur.com/a/OEmlFHn)

TLDR; Bullish Pennant, not the cleanest ever but it's there! Mirror's Tesla's recent one nicely.

Now, I'm no genius, quite the opposite, when I'm not completely stoned, I'm actually quite retarded. Good news for you autists, I am a bit stoned right now so I have some serious autist level shit going. If $PLTR can break above $27.63 and hold this week, we should be looking at a $40 price target within 30-60 days.

If no movement in the next week my hands are going to start feeling a bit more papery at the short term prospect of any significant movement.

Title: GME 4Q20 Financial Model   
Words and stuff. GameStop is gaining more support by the day with Hedgeye ([https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/GameStop+%28GME%29+Named+Best+Idea+Long+at+Hedgeye/17737543.html?classic=1](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/GameStop+%28GME%29+Named+Best+Idea+Long+at+Hedgeye/17737543.html?classic=1)) joining the GME Gang last week.

  shorts are still \~100% short and running out of time. Melvin Capital moved its put position up to January 22nd $15P and may be the culprit for a quirky Friday trade that implies they're beginning to de-risk even further. 

Other people can write more about that shit, or we can B.S. about it in the comments here.

Here's my DD contribution in the form of an updated 4Q20 financial model based on the updated e-commerce order rate data &amp; console sales we've observed from GME over the past weekend:

Title: No Luck, All $SKLZ - an E-sports Gambling Platform Set to Rival $DKNG
[Skillz.com](https://skillz.com/) (SKLZ) is a mobile esports gambling platform that lets your mom and her boyfriend gamble on whatever bull shit mobile games they play. Users pay a fee to enter a tournament for the chance to win real money. The payouts are huge, and people are addicted to this platform. 

 [https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/11/skillz-mobiles-top-esports-athletes-won-33-million-in-the-past-decade/](https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/11/skillz-mobiles-top-esports-athletes-won-33-million-in-the-past-decade/) 

 **In fact, users of Skillz remain engaged on the platform longer than than users of Facebook, Youtube, and Tik Tok (details below).**

Skillz has well over $1.6 billion in gross marketplace volume and over 2 billion tournaments played per year.

We all know people love to gamble. The problem is, your 55 year old mom doesn't use WSB and the Stonk market to get her gambling fix. Instead, she's logging onto [Skillz.com](https://skillz.com/) and playing Solitaire to try and win $200 to pay for your special ed class.

 **Jeff Sagansky and Harry Sloan, two huge shareholders of Draftkings (DKNG), are also shareholders of SKLZ.**

Looking at DKNG's price action &amp; valuation, it's quite clear that these guys know what they're doing. Management has a 2 year lock up period on shares so there is no risk of a dump.

**TLDR: With expected revenues to be \~$225 million in 2020 (80% YoY Growth), margins of over 90%, a massively growing industry, an extremely diverse user base, and a platform that keeps its users engaged longer than Facebook, Youtube, and Tik Tok, this is the most obvious buy of 2020-2021.**

**Positions: Jan 15 $25c**

I won't go into too much detail because I know none of you can read, so here's a few sentences with pretty pictures to help you idiots understand why the stonk price will go uppies.

The esports/gaming market is way bigger than any comparable entertainment market, and is set for sustained growth into the future. Mobile gaming specifically accounts for a massive chunk of that. Here's a pretty graphic for all of you retards:

I know you're probably thinking mobile games are retarded. They are. But it actually increases the total addressable market for Skillz by A LOT. **57% of Skillz users are femaie.** Females don't even make up 30% of console or PC gamers. Additionally, **53% of Skillz users are over 45 years old.** Don't believe me? Look at this pretty picture:

It's also important to consider they are only currently a mobile only platform. Management has hinted at the intent to break into console/pc games. Obviously that's too far in the future for any of us to care, but just pointing this out so you can really understand the growth potential.

Here's some info on their valuation compared to some other tech platforms:

**And the best part? Their average revenue per user is WAY higher than some other comparable companies like ZNGA or GLUU:**

Skillz currently does not even have ads on its platform and ARPU is STILL this high. The growth opportunities here are endless.

The esports/gaming market is way bigger than any comparable entertainment market, and is set for sustained growth into the future. Mobile gaming specifically accounts for a massive chunk of that. Here's a pretty graphic for all of you retards:

I know you're probably thinking mobile games are retarded. They are. But it actually increases the total addressable market for Skillz by A LOT. **57% of Skillz users are femaie.** Females don't even make up 30% of console or PC gamers. Additionally\*\*, 53% of Skillz users are over 45 years old.\*\* Don't believe me? Look at this pretty picture:

It's also important to consider they are only currently a mobile only platform. Management has hinted at the intent to break into console/pc games. Obviously that's too far in the future for any of us to care, but just pointing this out so you can really understand the growth potential.

Here's some info on their valuation compared to some other tech platforms:

Skillz currently does not even have ads on its platform and ARPU is STILL this high. The growth opportunities here are endless.

Title: No Luck, All $SKLZ - an E-sports Gambling Platform Set to Explode
[Skillz.com](https://skillz.com/) (SKLZ) is a mobile esports gambling platform that lets your mom and her boyfriend gamble on whatever bull shit mobile games they play. Users pay a fee to enter a tournament for the chance to win real money. The payouts are huge, and people are addicted to this platform: [https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/11/skillz-mobiles-top-esports-athletes-won-33-million-in-the-past-decade/](https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/11/skillz-mobiles-top-esports-athletes-won-33-million-in-the-past-decade/)

**Skillz has well over $1.6 billion in gross marketplace volume and over 2 billion tournaments played per year.**

We all know people love to gamble. The problem is, your 55 year old mom doesn't use WSB and the Stonk market to get her gambling fix. Instead, she's logging onto [Skillz.com](https://skillz.com/) and playing Solitaire to try and win $200 to pay for your special education class.

They just went public through a merger with a SPAC ($FEAC) that is **run by the same team that took Draftkings $DKNG public.**

Looking at DKNG's price action &amp; valuation, it's quite clear that these guys know what they're doing. Management has a 2 year lock up period on shares so there is no risk of a dump.

**TLDR: With expected revenues to be \~$225 million in 2020 (80% YoY Growth), margins of over 90%, a massively growing industry, an extremely diverse user base, and a platform that keeps its users engaged longer than Facebook, Youtube, and Tik Tok, this is the most obvious buy of 2020-2021.**

Title: SGMO- Investment Thesis- Full DD
 

* **Wtf is SGMO?** Its the most drastically undervalued gene therapy company on the market. They edit genes with zinc finger nucleases, a technology distinctly different from crispr.
* **Zinc Finger?** Its theoretically better than crispr. More specificity and less off-target edits than crispr, but years of reading investor village posts and the occasional research paper arent easily summarized. And how it works doesnt really change the thesis here.
* **Why is it undervalued?** Check out the market cap and past years price action of the competitors in the field

&amp;#x200B;

|Ticker|Market Cap|
|:-|:-|
|BMRN|16 B|
|CRSP|10.5 B|
|ONCE|Acquired for 4 B|
|EDIT|4 B|
|NTLA|3 B|
|SGMO|2 B|

&amp;#x200B;

* **Why is BMRN on there?** Because Biomarin is SGMOs largest competitor for Hemophilia A gene therapy, which also happens to SGMOs closest to market product. But, surprise, SGMO has better data than BMRN! This year they reported higher sustained clotting factor levels and no bleeds within the first 52 weeks for the highest dose level of SB-525. Biomarins patients are having bleeds and requiring factor, and because of it (and the much better data from SGMO) BMRN got a rejection from the FDA when they tried to get accelerated approval to beat SGMO to market: [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-biomarin-pharma-fda/u-s-fda-rejects-biomarin-hemophilia-a-gene-therapy-shares-dive-idUSKCN25F1H6](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-biomarin-pharma-fda/u-s-fda-rejects-biomarin-hemophilia-a-gene-therapy-shares-dive-idUSKCN25F1H6) BTW, the SGMO Hemophilia A gene therapy program is also partnered with \*Pfizer\*
* **Partnered with Pfizer?** **Yeah, and Takeda. And Kite therapeutics. And Novartis. And Sanofi. And Biogen.** Im retarded, but highly doubt those 5 big pharma partners and their entire team of scientists and capital allocation programs are as retarded as me. Look at the pipeline page: [https://www.sangamo.com/pipeline](https://www.sangamo.com/pipeline) And just for good measure, the Biogen/SGMO collaboration also included Biogen acquiring so much SGMO stock that Biogen owns like 17% of the damn company!!!! Acquisition rumors aboundand if you look at the table above most of those other names don't have anywhere near the number of partnerships/pipeline programs SGMO has.
* **Biogen partnership is for multiple neurological diseases, including Alzheimers, the single largest unmet need in medicine today.** And Biogen didnt fuck around with crispr for it.
* **Speaking of pipeline, I hope you clicked on the link to the pipeline page.** Aside from the Phase 3 trial with Pfizer, they have four Phase 1 or 2 trials, and 13 disclosed preclinical trials. And 7 wholly-owned (not partnered) programs. And an estimated 600-700 million cash runway, with the expenses for the phase 3 program with Pfizer covered by Pfizer, and a potential reimbursement of a few hundred thousand to $1 million plus per patient (still cheaper than replacement factor infusion therapy).
* **Why isnt this worth more?** I dunno, but I can guess. CRSPR was featured on Radiolab and had some articles written about it a few years ago, and has had enough press that most people have heard of it in passing. SGMO also had some false starts, once a long time ago when they were basically a different company trying to tackle some bullshit like diabetic neuropathy. Another time when they were trying to do gene editing in live patients for MPS II (the CHAMPIONS  trial) that didnt have great results. Yes, they are trying to edit genes in live humans. Turns out its hard. And yes, it worked via detection of targeted integration via liver biopsy, but had not edit enough cells to be clinically significant (theyre still working on it).
* **What else are they working on?** T-cell therapies, which can address anything from transplant rejection (their wholly-owned TX200 trial) to autoimmune diseases (IBD, also wholly owned). They bought the company TX Cell for 84 million in 2018 for this purpose.
* **So why the hell are you telling me about this now?** Last couple weeks have been weird and SGMO has been taking off. Look at the last year specifically this month- it fucking rocketed off, pulled back, and has started to climb again. Price action on this stock has always been super wonky. If you follow it as close as I do, youd notice the huge price spike happened \*after\* they reported the positive Hemophilia A data at ASH Dec 7th- the price spiked Dec 10th.
* **Anything else going to make the price rocket up?** Aside from the fact that every gene therapy company chart has been a goddamn hockey stick this year, heres some events: [https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&amp;mn=152550&amp;pt=msg&amp;mid=21430904](https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&amp;mn=152550&amp;pt=msg&amp;mid=21430904)
* **Also, its not in the ARKG gene therapy fund yet**, but theres a good chance Cathie Wood might shift profits from other names to SGMO #1 to diversify and #2 because its comparatively cheap as shit.
* **Speaking of price, HCW just gave it a $25 price target.** Truist gave it price target $23. Some badass analyst with huge nuts had it at $36. The average is like $21. Mine personally is $25 this year and $45 long term. Heres some undiagnosed autist on IV making a case: [https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&amp;mn=152920&amp;pt=msg&amp;mid=21447148](https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&amp;mn=152920&amp;pt=msg&amp;mid=21447148)
* **Yeah but do you own any, you kooky fuck with a wizard avatar?** Yeah, I have 2500+ shares, 25+ ITM calls, and 40+ OTM calls across all my accounts. I attached a screenshot from my traditional IRA. Its most of my tradeable retirement. Not sure if this counts as YOLO? I feel like Im wearing a life helmet at this point having held and accumulated this shit for 3+ years and finally seeing it take off.
* **Thesis summary; SGMO is undervalued.** They have superior gene editing technology and a shit ton of shots on target in their huge pipeline with 5 big pharma partners, and they are getting close to hemophilia A gene therapy being commercialized in early 2022. Even if they completely fuck up more than half their pipeline theyre still undervalued.
* **TLDR; why to invest in SGMO:** [https://www.sangamo.com/pipeline](https://www.sangamo.com/pipeline)
* **TLDR; Buy SGMO now.**      LEAPs &gt; short term, this stock trades weird and I dont know how soon      it will rocket off, but started to launch a couple weeks ago. **Shares      are still cheap.** Dont buy calls too far OTM in case of buyout. **May      and August calls in the $17-$20 range seem cheap. Jan22 $20 strike looks      good to me, or Jan23 $25 strike. $20 conservative price target by      year-end 2021. Long term price target $45.** 
* *Note: the original post got banned because I updated it and used a four-letter word that was a banned ticker. I'm sorry to anyone that commented on that one.*

It's also important to consider they are only currently a mobile only platform. Management has hinted at the intent to break into console/pc games. Obviously that's too far in the future for any of us to care, but just pointing this out so you can really understand the growth potential.

Here's some info on their valuation compared to some other tech platforms:

**And the best part? Their average revenue per user is WAY higher than some other comparable companies like ZNGA or GLUU:**

Skillz currently does not even have ads on its platform and ARPU is STILL this high. The growth opportunities here are endless.

I'll stop here since this is about as much information as you drooling idiots can handle.

Title: Bed Bath to the  and Beyond
**\*\*TLDR WITH POSITIONS BELOW\*\***

With strong leadership, a stimulus, and covid spurred focus on home improvement, BBBY is posed for a strong earnings report on Jan 8th and could retest its october highs.

**Overview:**  
BBBY is a home improvement retail company that operates through the US and Canada.  
**Leadership:**  
Mark Tritton - I'll quote Jim Cramer here, "the **NUMBER-ONE CEO** they could get"  
\- at Target, he remodeled 1800 stores, revamped their ecommerce business, and launched successful 40 private label brands  
\- a further look into BBBY's financials will show you how he's **already** been successful in turning around the company

**Financials**  
Let's start by looking at their 4 year financials: **THEY ARE AWFUL**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b21b1r1bxf661.png?width=867&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74607aa690f1366f99a4be518fd4cf55bd631f24

\- decreasing revenue

\- decreasing profit

\- increasing SG&amp;A

\- decreasing and negative net income

**But let's see how the financials have been since Mark Tritton came**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jq96gfmbxf661.png?width=912&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ca215c3c066961f87892e8facdf243821e129a3

A **COMPLETELY** different story

\- Revenue growth

\- Cost of revenue down

\- Gross margin at levels unseen for years

\- Racking up Cash

\- Paying off debt

\- EBIT rising

Obviously, COVID led to one awful quarter that skewed the rest of the year, but Tritton is already showing results. His earnings call also showed guidance and a vision for the company.

**Notable statements from earnings call**

\- **Strongest earnings in** **2 YEARS**

\- The average age of the customer **decreased by 6 years**

\- Digital revenue up **89%**

\- **MORE SHARE BUYBACKS**

\- Lots of cash

\- Closing lower performing stores and focusing on an omnichannel approach

\- **2 million new customers** online

\- Lower coupon usage -&gt; higher margins

**Notable Transactions**

\- High volume on the 20$ C expiring jan 15th after earnings

\- Insiders have been buying shares @ 20$

**Technicals (I am awful at this)**

\- Support at 18.5 **meaning that 18.7 is an appealing entry point**

\- MACD is **BEARISH**

**TLDR**:

Short term, **BBBY will run up before earnings** as it has historically  
Long term, **BBBY is posed for a turnaround** similar to that of Target's with excellent leadership and a great vision  
**JIM CRAMER IS BULLISH ON BBBY AS WELL**

**POSITIONS: Shares, Jan 15 21 C, Jan 8 20 C, Dec 31 20 C**

**I bought in at 19 but will likely buy more if it reaches 18.50**

Title: Opendoor - Welcome to the Stratosphere
Alright fucktards listen up. This contains almost 0 fundamental analysis and is based purely on speculation and my gut feeling. This past week, IPOB, one of Chamath Palijizzapia's 5,000 SPACs, completed its merger with Opendoor. CEO Eric Wu-tang is ringing the NASDAQ bell tomorrow, and Opendoor Technologies will officially trade under the ticker OPEN. I feel like this may be the biggest &amp; best SPAC deal to date, and the stock will go absolutely stratospheric. Here's why:

Opendoor is actually a real fucking company already doing billions in revenue. Are they profitable? No, but they have a path to profitability and also no one gives a shit these days. They are a tech-centric real estate disrupter startup unicorn. Tech + disrupter \* startup = moon. I worked at this company for a bit, and they are run by some of the smartest fuckers I have ever met. Their machine-learning algo is prime and continues improving every day. Soon it will replace all humans on earth.

I know, the naysayers are gonna pipe up about "margins" and "unproven business model". I don't give a shit. It doesn't matter. Opendoor's arch-rival Zillow (Z) is trading at a 5.45 EV-Sales, while Opendoor is somewhere around 2.5 EV-Sales. OPEN also did 4.4x more sales than Z in 2019. Z is playing catchup and does not yet have the infrastructure nor technology to compete with OPEN. You might bring up RDFN. Don't give a fuck, they're irrelevant.

With the flight from cities only just beginning, near 0 interest rates for the foreseeable future, and the economy opening back up post-vaccine, this all plays swimmingly into OPEN's hands. They will crush all opposition and eventually be the first thing you think of when someone mentions residential real estate.

TL;DR: Stimulus check on OPEN 02/19/21 40c.

Title: Brand new close to NAV SPAC merging with a fintech unicorn: AJAX
alright listen up my fellow retards, if you're tired of chasing pltr, gme, and whatever the meme stock of the week is, i got some serious dd for you

AJAX or [AJAX I Acquisition Corp](https://ajaxcap.com/team/) is a fintech SPAC led by Dan Och(co-founder of Och-Ziff Capital Management Group with 50b+ AUM and founder/current chairman of Willoughby Capital) and Glenn Fuhrman(founder of MSP capital with 20b+ AUM). these are some big fucking players, and their board of advisors is even more stacked: 
- James Morgan--co-founder of Square 
- Kevin Systrom--co-founder/former CEO of Instagram
- Steve Ells--founder/former CEO of Chipotle
- Anne Wojcicki--co-founder and CEO of 23andMe. 
there are also a bunch of higher-up fucks from Dan Och's hedge fund willoughby capital on the key investment team.

let's look at their [sec filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-030803/). if you can't read, they're targeting a merge with a business in the **internet, software, fintech, and consumer industries**. from the same sec report, you can see that willoughby capital's investments include Coinbase, Github, Instacart, Robinhood, **Stripe**, and **Transferwise**.

let's be real, stripe is a big dick player and probably doesn't need a spac to IPO. if it does turn out to be stripe, i'm fucking rich. more likely it'll be TransferWise. 

you're probably thinking, what the fuck is TransferWise and why should I invest in it?
TransferWise is a fintech unicorn that is relatively unknown and is still in its hypergrowth stage. I won't go too much into the financials of TransferWise because i'm a goddamn retard but I will provide some basic numbers and a link to [the source](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/transferwise-reports-accelerating-revenue-growth-to-70-in-its-march-2020-fiscal-year/): 
- Fiscal 2020 revenue: 302.6 million, up 70% from its fiscal 2019 result of 179 million 
- 8 million worldwide customers, up from 6 million in the preceding fiscal year or 33%. 
- Fourth year of consecutive profitability 
- $5 billion valuation in July of 2020 

the cherry on top? the day after AJAX goes public, it was announced that TransferWise has [started hiring banks for an IPO](https://news.sky.com/story/transferwise-to-hire-banks-for-blockbuster-float-12167155). 

tl;dr ajax will very possibly merge with fintech unicorn TransferWise, get the fuck in here before it takes off

Title: Buy Himx!!!!!!!
$HIMX
 to follow amd. AMD ran from 2.79 to 15.55 in 11 months during 2016/17. Profit was -.17, -.05, .03 and -.01 during period. Himx over last 4 qtrs has shown positive profit culminating at .073 for last qtr. Granted amd bigger and flashier product rumor at the time but himx is at the starting gate and still hated by the non believers. 4th qtr guidance has potential to make believers out of haters. Amd is not an isolated case. By the time himx story becomes obvious it will be following the amd run of 2018. Amd ran from 10 to 30 in 5 months of 2018 and the rest is history.

HIMX has caused much pain to many longs and many will pile out as they make a little profit. *However newbies will NOT recognize that pain because what they will see is a stock that has increased 432 % over the last 39 weeks and has just started the s curve business cycle. Strong 4 th qtr guidance could propel this stock greatly beyond expectations. No predictions just showing how fast sht happens

Title: SGMO- Investment Thesis
*   **Wtf is SGMO?** Its the most drastically undervalued gene therapy company on the market. They edit genes with zinc finger nucleases, a technology distinctly different from crispr. 
* **Zinc Finger?** Its theoretically better than crispr. More specificity and less off-target edits than crispr, but years of reading investor village posts and the occasional research paper arent easily summarized. And how it works doesnt really change the thesis here.
* **Why is it undervalued?** Check out the market cap and past years price action of the competitors in the field

&amp;#x200B;

|BMRN|16 Billion|
|:-|:-|
|CRSP|10.5 Billion|
|ONCE|Acquired for 4 Billion|
|EDIT|4 Billion|
|NTLA|3 Billion|
|SGMO|2 Billion|

&amp;#x200B;

* **Why is BMRN on there?** Because Biomarin is SGMOs largest competitor for Hemophilia A gene therapy, which also happens to SGMOs closest to market product. But, surprise, SGMO has better data than BMRN! This year they reported higher sustained clotting factor levels and no bleeds within the first 52 weeks for the highest dose level of SB-525. Biomarins patients are having bleeds and requiring factor, and because of it (and the much better data from SGMO)  BMRN got a rejection from the FDA when they tried to get accelerated approval to beat SGMO to market: [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-biomarin-pharma-fda/u-s-fda-rejects-biomarin-hemophilia-a-gene-therapy-shares-dive-idUSKCN25F1H6](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-biomarin-pharma-fda/u-s-fda-rejects-biomarin-hemophilia-a-gene-therapy-shares-dive-idUSKCN25F1H6) BTW, the SGMO Hemophilia A gene therapy program is also partnered with \*Pfizer\*
* **Partnered with Pfizer?** **Yeah, and Takeda. And Kite therapeutics. And Novartis. And Sanofi. And Biogen.** Im retarded, but highly doubt those 5 big pharma partners and their entire team of scientists and capital allocation programs are as retarded as me. Look at the pipeline page: [https://www.sangamo.com/pipeline](https://www.sangamo.com/pipeline) And just for good measure, the Biogen/SGMO collaboration also included Biogen acquiring so much SGMO stock that Biogen owns like 17% of the damn company!!!! Acquisition rumors abound
* **Biogen partnership is for multiple neurological diseases, including Alzheimers, the single largest unmet need in medicine today.** And Biogen didnt fuck around with crispr for it.
* **Speaking of pipeline, I hope you clicked on the link to the pipeline page.** Aside from the Phase 3 trial with Pfizer, they have four Phase 1 or 2 trials, and 13 disclosed preclinical trials. And 7 wholly-owned (not partnered) programs. And an estimated 600-700 million cash runway, with the expenses for the phase 3 program with Pfizer covered by Pfizer, and a potential reimbursement of a few hundred thousand to $1 million plus per patient (still cheaper than replacement factor infusion therapy).
* **Why isnt this worth more?** I dunno, but I can guess. CRSPR was featured on Radiolab and had some articles written about it a few years ago, and has had enough press that most people have heard of it in passing. SGMO also had some false starts, once a long time ago when they were basically a different company trying to tackle some bullshit like diabetic neuropathy. Another time when they were trying to do gene editing in live patients for MPS II (the CHAMPIONS  trial) that didnt have great results. Yes, they are trying to edit genes in live humans. Turns out its hard. And yes, it worked via detection of targeted integration via liver biopsy, but had not edit enough cells to be clinically significant (theyre still working on it).
* **What else are they working on?** T-cell therapies, which can address anything from transplant rejection (their wholly-owned TX200 trial) to autoimmune diseases (IBD, also wholly owned). They bought the company TX Cell for 84 million in 2018 for this purpose.
* **So why the hell are you telling me about this now?** Last couple weeks have been weird and SGMO has been taking off. Look at the last year specifically this month- it fucking rocketed off, pulled back, and has started to climb again. Price action on this stock has always been super wonky. If you follow it as close as I do, youd notice the huge price spike happened \*after\* they reported the positive Hemophilia A data at ASH Dec 7th- the price spiked Dec 10th. 
* **Anything else going to make the price rocket up?** Aside from the fact that every gene therapy company chart has been a goddamn hockey stick this year, heres some events: [https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&amp;mn=152550&amp;pt=msg&amp;mid=21430904](https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&amp;mn=152550&amp;pt=msg&amp;mid=21430904)
* **Also, its not in the ARKG gene therapy fund yet**, but theres a good chance Cathie Wood might shift profits from other names to SGMO #1 to diversify and #2 because its comparatively cheap as shit.
* **Speaking of price, HCW just gave it a $25 price target.** Truist gave it price target $23. Some badass analyst with huge nuts had it at $36. The average is like $21. Mine personally is $25 this year and $45 long term. Heres some undiagnosed autist on IV making a case: [https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&amp;mn=152920&amp;pt=msg&amp;mid=21447148](https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&amp;mn=152920&amp;pt=msg&amp;mid=21447148)
* **Yeah but do you own any, you kooky fuck with a wizard avatar?** Yeah, I have 2500+ shares, 25+ ITM calls, and 40+ OTM calls across all my accounts. I attached a screenshot from my traditional IRA. Its most of my tradeable retirement. Not sure if this counts as YOLO? I feel like Im wearing a life helmet at this point having held and accumulated this shit for 3+ years and finally seeing it take off.
* **Thesis summary; SGMO is undervalued.** They have superior gene editing technology and a shit ton of shots on target in their huge pipeline with 5 big pharma partners, and they are getting close to hemophilia A gene therapy being commercialized in early 2022. Even if they completely fuck up more than half their pipeline theyre still undervalued.
* **TLDR; why to invest in SGMO:** [https://www.sangamo.com/pipeline](https://www.sangamo.com/pipeline)
* **TLDR; Buy SGMO now.** LEAPs &gt; short term, this stock trades weird and I dont know how soon it will rocket off, but started to launch a couple weeks ago. **Shares are still cheap.** Dont buy calls too far OTM in case of buyout. **May and August calls in the $17-$20 range seem cheap. Jan22 $20 strike looks good to me, or Jan23 $25 strike. $20 conservative price target by year-end 2021. Long term price target $45.**

Title: $MT - a further dive into why this IS the steel play of 2021
Fresh off by two day ban in WSB jail, giving me plenty of time to further dive into why $MT is going to moon in 2021.

First about $MT:

* They are the world's LARGEST steel maker - and its not even close after #2.  [https://www.worldsteel.org/steel-by-topic/statistics/top-producers.html](https://www.worldsteel.org/steel-by-topic/statistics/top-producers.html)
* ArcelorMittal also hit its $7 billion net debt target at the end of the 3rd quarter, **the lowest level since ArcelorMittals creation in 2006 and a point at which the company can start returning cash to shareholders**.
* The company is poised to sell its U.S. assets in a cash and shares deal with Cleveland-Cliffs Inc for $1.4 billion in a deal that has allowed it to **launch a $500 million share buyback.**
*  Under the terms of the sale, **ArcelorMittal has received $505 million cash,78 million shares of Cleveland-Cliffs common stock and non-voting preferred stock which is redeemable for approximately 58 million shares of Cleveland-Cliffs common stock or an equivalent amount in cash -** meaning if $CLF performs well, $MT further benefits.
* $MT has been selling off assets in the US for years to take advantage of currency advantage of manufacturing in Canada and cost labor advantage of manufacturing in Mexico:

**Commenting, Mr. Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:**

*This transaction is a unique opportunity for ArcelorMittal to unlock significant value for shareholders while retaining exposure to the North American economy through our high-quality NAFTA assets alongside a participation in what will be a stronger, better integrated, US business. I would like to thank all employees of ArcelorMittal USA for their hard work in ensuring the business maintained its reputation as a trusted, quality supplier of steels for American manufacturing. I am confident you will have a bright future with Cleveland-Cliffs.*

* Favorable valuation achieved for ArcelorMittal USA due to the high synergistic potential of the combined company. The Transaction valuation for ArcelorMittal USA equates to an enterprise value multiple of approximately 6x through-the-cycle EBITDA.
* ArcelorMittal will participate in the upside potential of the larger combined company, which is more diversified, fully-integrated and has significant synergy potential
* The deconsolidation of the associated liabilities at ArcelorMittal USA, comprising mostly pension and OPEB liabilities, will improve the Groups risk profile, reduce net debt and strengthen its capital structure and credit metrics.

Let's move on to mining because there are many that claim $VALE is the play because of iron ore.  $VALE is a good play, but $MT as it pertains to mining:

*  $MT is active in the whole value chain, from exploration and development to mining, concentration, pelletizing, rail transport and port operations. With operations that span Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia, we aim to optimize our portfolio so we can deliver results at any point in the economic cycle, and to manage our assets to the highest standards. We are equally driven to mine responsibly and sustainably, minimizing the impact of mining on the natural environment, and working closely with local communities to build skills and social infrastructure to ensure long-term development.
* We have a geographically diversified portfolio of 14 operating units in Brazil, Bosnia, Canada, Kazakhstan, Liberia, Mexico, Ukraine and United States that in 2019 produced **57.1 million tons of iron ore and 5.5 million tons of coking coal. Our main products include iron ore lump, fines, concentrate pellets and sinter feed, and coking coal, thermal coal and pulverized coal injection (PCI) coal.**

**VERTICAL INTEGRATION -** so the largest steel maker in the world supplies over half of it's raw materials - allowing them to cost average down higher ore prices, thus expanding their margins on finished product.

&amp;#x200B;

[Vertical Integration and #1 steel maker in the world](https://preview.redd.it/6g9xy2u6de661.png?width=2438&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf5e0e5859ece05b3a2fffbbc8f25f9e632b26e8)

That brings me to the current DEMAND&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;SUPPLY situation the word is in regarding raw materials and finished goods.  THIS HAS NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE 2005, peaking like a rocket in 2008.  It had more legs in 2008, but the Great Recession put an abrupt end to the party.

Here is were we stand as of last week:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zgt45uzbge661.png?width=527&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a4357d0d4adce59d8ca1de95c7d039976e24afd

Here is an overall look of the past 18 years, notice 2008 and current action:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Starting to mirror 2008 action](https://preview.redd.it/37avzrvshe661.png?width=1186&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5380d1b84263c0dc7ba7ddbb04f2a7b7d517422)

In 2008 $MT was trading at the following:

&amp;#x200B;

[The run up and peak before the Great Recession collapse](https://preview.redd.it/t1nicl3oie661.png?width=1931&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15a38b26fcefa2815baf39e518d917db28795ce0)

The difference between 2008 and today - there was more uncertainty believe it or not then in 2008 than today.  Banks were going out of business, the total collapse in mortgage backed securities and people walking away from homes.  Who in their right mind would ever want to own a home again?

Well, that has changed dramatically, while things are still a bit uncertain - vaccines are rolling out world-wide.  Interest rates are at all time lows and will be in the US until at least 2023.  The exodus of people from high tax states and cities due to "work from home" changes has created a housing boom in the suburbs and rural areas.  Homes need steel for foundations, fasteners and more importantly large appliances - dishwashers, washers, dryers, stoves, etc.  Have you seen Whirlpool stock this year?  $74 to $188, went over $200 - demand and higher steel prices = higher revenues.  When new homes and communities are built - the infrastructure follows -schools, hospitals, government buildings, shopping - all large projects that use massive amounts of steel.

Speaking of interest rates, outside of the US in recent years, an increasing number of central banks have resorted to low-rate policies. Several, including the European Central Bank and the central banks of Denmark, Japan, Sweden, and Switzerland, have started experimenting with ***negative interest rates*** **essentially making banks pay to park their excess cash at the central bank. The aim is to encourage banks to lend out those funds instead, thereby countering the weak growth that persisted after the 2008 global financial crisis.** 

The point being to all of this is **THIS IS NOT A LIQUIDITY CRISIS** like we saw in 2008 - banks are printing money at a rate that we are seeing inflation and hyper inflation in commodity prices - the US Dollar Index now stands at the lowest level since January of 2014 and is expected to further decline. A weaker US Dollar buys less in foreign goods, thus further increasing the price of imported goods.

Ok, now that I have bored you to death here is the point:

**$MT TAKEAWAYS:**

* Upgraded by SocGen to $30USD PT - they doubled EBITDA estimates for 2021 and 2022 **50% above market consensus.**
* Goldman Sachs keeps buy rating increasing to $29USD PT [https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ARCELORMITTAL-34942237/news/ARCELORMITTAL-Gets-a-Buy-rating-from-Goldman-Sachs-32032450/](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ARCELORMITTAL-34942237/news/ARCELORMITTAL-Gets-a-Buy-rating-from-Goldman-Sachs-32032450/)
* Jeffries maintains buy rating with $27 PT
*   [https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ARCELORMITTAL-34942237/news/Market-Chatter-ArcelorMittal-Lifts-Hot-Rolled-Coil-Prices-by-EUR50-MT-S-P-Global-Platts-Reports-32039746/](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ARCELORMITTAL-34942237/news/Market-Chatter-ArcelorMittal-Lifts-Hot-Rolled-Coil-Prices-by-EUR50-MT-S-P-Global-Platts-Reports-32039746/)
*  ArcelorMittal has held recent discussions with automakers over annual contracts and has been **targeting a 100-120/t increase**, according to market participants. Carmakers negotiating backdated deals have staunchly refused to pay such increases after securing rollovers or slight discounts from other mills. **But those negotiating calendar-year 2021 prices have been left with little room to negotiate, given the rocketing spot market and higher contract settlements with general industry participants**. 
*  The companys current stock price of a little over $23 reflects a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of approximately 6x, which is lower than the average forward P/E multiple of 7.2x for major iron ore miners and much lower than the average forward P/E multiple of 12.8x for the broader metals and mining industry.  **Thus, at this point ArcelorMittals stock seems to be undervalued.** It should be $36-$38 based on this alone.

I believe we will see some bigger moves of $MT over the next 6-8 weeks.  

My PT is $30 to $40 (BULL) by mid-February and believe earnings in February will smash expectations, further gapping up the stock like we saw in 2007-08.

I do not believe we will see $300 again this cycle, but SUPER BULL scenario could be $100, as I now believe based on futures orders now being pushed at to May, there are further legs for increases through out 2021.  

I like the common stock, based on the undervalue P/E multiple alone.

I love the options for Feb-June based on earnings and anticipation of a blow-out quarter as more is reported daily on steel and shortages.

Good luck!

Title: DD POST: MT
I used a picture because I heard most of the people in this sub can't read:

People have said that MT follows the Price of Metal Index but there hasn't been a strong enough analysis of that fact:

The last time the Global Price of Metal Index was at 146.40 MT (its current position), MT was trading around $36.00 a share. MT does follow the price of the Metal Index but not exactly: historic trends indicate that it trades well at or above what would the corresponding value would be based on the index. Throw in the current supply chain issues and this could be magnified. The share price of MT has not traded lower than $27.00 based on a comparative relationship with the global metal index which is much higher than the  $23.45 that it's trading at currently.

I'm honestly worried that this shit hasn't been meme'd the fuck out yet. I'm an idiot and this basic level analysis indicates huge upside potential. 

&amp;#x200B;

Positions: MT Feb 19 $31C, MT Jan 15 $25C, MT Apr 16 $30C, CLF Mar $20C

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Price of Metal goes up, MT goes up MT = MEtal, Metal=Tendies:

Title: CD Projekt Red $OTGLY &gt; $GME
Despite CP2077 launch issues CD Projekt Red should moon in the near future &amp; recent sell off is an opportunity:

1) They already sold 8 Million pre order copies generating proceeds that cover the entire 7 - 8 years of development/marketing which is several times more than Witcher 3 launch. Anything after this is pure profit.

2) They plan to sell 30 to 50 Million copies of the game in total in 2 years which would imply revenues of around $ 1billion yearly comparing with their current yearly revenues of around $ 150 million. Their current market cap is around $ 10 Billion

3) CD Projekt Red has better profitablity than competition with net margins at ~50% despite not having micro transactions. It's even higher the EA which is the greediest of the bunch in charging for micro transactions.

4) They have yet to release multiplayer for the game will just start applying micro transactions this is a change in business module that should generate significant revenue growth going forward.

5) Though the bugs are it's really terrible it's not really that uncustomary that large games such as CP2077 face bugs in the beginning

6) 50% of the game's sales are from PC sales alone which does not face as severe bugs as older generation consoles. Newer generation consoles are still untapped.

What else?

This isn't investment advice but I am pretty sure the bears are doomed at this point. The dream was so vivid. Execs from all three were gathered in one building like something out of barbarians at the gate and newly appointed CEO Cohen was going back and forth between the two conference room screaming at people and barking like a dog with his shirt unbuttoned and sweat dripping down his face. He straight up shamed them like he did with Amazon. Couldn't have been more real.

Title: Tycoon Gang, Do Yo Chain Hang Low? Pt. 1 - Smokestacks
Whaddup cock womblers, its ya boy, Chingy, back once again to inquire about about the length of yo chain and its mineral composition. I'm a proud member of the WSB weekend squad -- we're like the Tuesday afternoon squad at a strip club, so don't expect to get a lap dance from Carmen Electra circa 2003. I don't even know how to show you my crayon collection. But I don't usually have time to write DD's while I'm flipping burgers at Wendy's 9-5, so this is what you get.   


My last post caused me to get DMed some smart questions, and some not-so-smart questions. So, because it's cold af outside and I can't stand any weather that's too cold for flip flops, I stayed my ass in my fortress of solitude, surrounded by my jizz rags, the whole damn weekend thinking about this play. If you're illiterate or need TL;DRs and rocket emojis, then pass by. If you're looking to play weeklies and other FDs, then pass by. I do have some moonshot plays I'm doing as well, and if ya'll yodel on my chode enough, I might tell you about them, but no, this DD is for 1/3 of the centerpiece of my 2021 play. That's right, I actually try and plan moves a year out and then measure the results over weeks rather than fucking minutes, you fucking head-trauma goldfish. 

Basically, my play breaks down into 3 segments: Smokestacks, Ships, and Mines. I'll break down my DD on smokestacks with some of my top picks here. If ya'll want, I'll do Part 2 and 3 for Ships and Mines, but shit would be too long if I did it all at the same time, and I know many of you are already glossy eyed over this wall of text.  My last post was directed at MT gang, because they were seeing what I am seeing but let's have a quick re-cap to the current situation, the past, and the future so that you can understand the macroeconomic context of this play. 

**The Prologue**

Let's start in 2018. We could go back further, and for some of the stocks in Part 2 and 3, we will, but 2018 is a good place to start. What happened in 2018? Well, something pretty major, something pretty fucking epically stupid which will likely be corrected in the near term and bring us tendies in the long-term. Metals began a pretty gnarly slump in early 2018, and that slump drug a lot of things down; the whole materials sector flopped, dry goods shippers and bulkers flopped, mines flopped. It was shit show. Why? Trump put his retarded ass tariffs in place. They didn't do shit except cause the market to go down faster than a Kentucky truck stop whore. Even if you look at US Steel, it spiked after the announcement, then sank with the rest of the market. Why? Because increased costs tanked demand. This is proof that just because someone knows how to get slack-jawed cousin fuckers to part with their money for some magical red hats, that they don't know fuck all about economics. Now, what you may not know is that those tariffs applied to things besides steel too, basically all the metals, and we're going to be picking up on all of that. Love it or hate it, Biden is an old-school free-trade neo-liberal, and he's going to get rid of that dumbass tariff, and that means more money moving in the market, which means more tendies for us. In removing the tariff, other countries will likely also remove their tariffs on American materials, so everyone wins and can have a big old globalist circle jerk about it, but my money is on the European and South American materials makers.

 In fact, I only have two American steel stocks in my play because Trump's retard tariff caused more harm to American industry than to global industry. How? The rest of the world kept trading with each other and we got locked out, so in a recovery play, I'm looking at companies that have fewer barriers to global market, existing global orders, and companies who don't have to start from scratch in re-joining the global recovery, which excludes most American companies because holy fuck did Trump screw the pooch and provide a lovely gift to everyone who isn't American. Removing the tariffs is also going to cause pain to American steel because their safety blanket get pulled away - a problem foreign metal won't have. Yes, yes, American steel like X and CFL will do alright too long-term, but they have more headwinds getting back into the global market that the tariffs made them uncompetitive in. Another consequence of the tariffs is that they didn't actually touch raw iron ore, whose prices remained fairly high, thus pushing the cost of of American steel comparatively higher, giving a double whammy to the cost of American steel compared to others who were moving downwards faster, thus shifting demand to countries that didn't have tariffs.

**The Play**  

So let's have a look at who is in my play. I call this the "Smokestacks" segment, this is where the raw ore gets turned into something useful. I'll give you the ticker symbol, my positions, and a quick reason why I like it besides the other reasons I mention in this post. So even if you think the tariffs will stay, there's other good reasons to look at these.

MT ( July 24c &amp; shares). *Weekly moving average has been on a steep climb since end of October. Lots of room to recover. 3 recent price increases on its products. It's a meme.*  

AA (July 23c &amp; shares)  *Weekly moving average has been on a steep climb since end of October. Lots of room to recover. Curtailment of mass layoffs. Aluminum prices also on rebound. Actually engaging in some sustainability efforts, which may get favorable treatment from eco-conscious buyers. All facilities 100% operational.*   

STLD (Jan 2022 37c &amp; shares). *Weekly moving average has been on a steep climb since end of October. Upcoming Texas expansion. TSLA cybertruck steel supplier*

T K A M Y (Shares) *Weekly moving average has been on a steep climb since end of October. Lots of room to recover. Exposure to maritime market will allow it to catch the wave as cruise ships return to service and shippers upgrade and repair their fleets. Look for lots of drydock repairs in Q4 2021 to continue to lift the value* 

A N I O Y (Shares). *I don't really have a reason to include this one besides the basic reasons of this DD, but everything else is pretty slow and steady, so I thought I should include one roulette/heart-attack stock.*  

CMC (June 20c &amp; shares) *I wouldn't buy into this at the moment of publication of this DD, wait for it to dip and for that weekly moving average to get back above the market price. I think it's got another 10%-15% of growth in it and it wouldn't be as hard hit by tariff removal due to presence in other markets (it's the only other American company on my list for that reason, but there's a reason I'm generally bearish on American steel) Tariff removal is going to be good for metals, but not necessarily American ones, at least in the short-term, but I think this one will weather it a bit better.* 

TX (May 30c &amp; shares). *Just look at that weekly moving average. Still has about 33% room for recovery. Integrating AI into production management.* 

SID (June 4c &amp; shares). *This one actually was a rocket, and I expect growth to slow a bit short term, but ITM calls are still cheap, although I'd wait for a pullback. But it's doing well, considering doing a separate IPO for their mining unit, which, by the way, is another reason I like this one, it straddles both the smokestacks and mining Segment. Ore prices have remained high despite metals slump, so since they are in both ore and metals, I like them for growth beyond recovery.*  

G M B X F (Shares). *I am hesitant to include this in the smokestacks segment rather than the mines segment, but they're pretty well vertically integrated, so I'll include them in both. Copper market is an undervalued play as well, and these guys are one of the big dicks in that arena. I'll expand my thoughts on this one and other miners like VALE, SCCO, and RIO in Part 3.*   

**Breaking it Down, Pepe Silvia Style**

So let's look at these real quick. I've got positions in all of them, but maybe you don't want go as deep on the chain as I have, so do your own DD and figure out which you like. Most of these are non-American (STLD and CMC being the exceptions). As I mentioned above, I'm more bullish on foreign metals because the removal of the tariffs is going to have a bigger, positive impact on them, while removing the tariffs will initially have a negative impact on American steel. I'm also more bullish on foreign metals because they've been able to continue to trade in each others markets and thus have less catching-up to do in the recovery. Why did I include STLD and CMC? I like STLD because they seem to be in a growth phase right now, I'm looking for an expansion in Texas to potentially break ground in 2021, and I like CMC because they have more foreign exposure than many of their US competitors (they're a member of EuroFER, for example, X is the only other US member of that, and it's just a small Polish subsidiary).

Before getting into when you can expect tendies, let's revisit the current situation and look towards the future to understand why I'm bullish on metals at all, and foreign ones in particular.  As mentioned, we all now know that the Tantrump Tariff was a shit show that brought the market down by artificially spiking prices (2018) and that depressed demand (2018 &amp; 2019), which ultimately drove down the prices to the shithole they've been in. Then, the pandemic hit and really hammered on it. But, the demand never really went away, it just went into hibernation. 2018-2019 saw major slow downs in domestic industrial growth; fewer and smaller expansions and some pretty large ones that were canceled outright. From my professional experience (I'm an economic developer for the G men), I can tell you that 2018 was the worst year we had. I usually shuffle 3-4 projects across my desk a month, we had 3 the entire year of 2018. Shit was grim. I even visited Europe to go talk to the companies and ask them why they were pulling out, "we'll call you in 2 years" is what they said. And guess what cock goblins!? They have! All the companies I was courting had the need and desire to expand, but backed off because of what was going on in the market, their ROI would've been too low to cover the debt of their expansions because the cost for those expansions had magically gone up overnight thanks to the fart bubble muncher in the White House. So you may be wondering, "but if steel prices are going up again, why are industrials pulling the trigger on expansions now?" Good question, retard! Part of the answer is that they've been sitting on cash for 2 years that they otherwise would've invested in growth, part of the answer is that steel prices are now naturally rising (due to the scaling back of production capacity since 2018) and thus unlikely to be waited out, and they are still lower than before the whole tariff fiasco started, and removing the tariff would keep some downward pressure on prices while juicing demand. Basically, when the price of metals artificially spiked due to the tariffs, it made sense to try and wait them out, but to those who were mining and making the metals, it meant they suddenly had a big drop in anticipated demand, and so they had to scale back,  but keep their prices up. But like I said, the demand didn't die, it just wanted to wait for a better time. Now we're in an interesting situation; prices are rising naturally due to that pent-up demand and deferred growth wanting to come out, the scale back in production capacity has created a premium on what can be produced, and future economic conditions are better for it, especially since Biden is more likely to re-engage in free-trade than whatever retarded-ass protectionist nonsense the village idiot of Mar-a-Lago was doing to gin up the mouth-breathers. But the production capacity needs to recover and then keep growing to meet demand, and that's where we get on.   

**The Payoff**

So what does all of that mean for your tendies? Well, it means that the the whole supply chain that has been running a skeleton crew for the past 2 years is about to wake the fuck up. Demand from 2 years ago is re-entering the pipeline, natural growth is starting to show back up, those retard tariffs are probably on their way out. For the life of me, I can't explain how real estate has weathered the pandemic so well, but it has, and that sustained demand is part of what is driving up the cost on structural steel. Shit. Those prices are going up so fast even shippers are scrapping their old ships to get in on it. I'll discuss this more in Part 2 and why it means dry goods shippers and bulkers are gonna be in victory lane as well, but that's for next time. For now, let's stick to how we're going to make money off the smokestacks. 

The first thing to note here, and I'll even bold it, is: ***THIS IS NOT A ROCKET.*** If you're gonna choose an emoji, find a freight train (also in Part 2). Alright? Don't be asking me if January calls are what you should get, because the answer is no unless you're talking about 2022. No, this is a long ass train, loaded with tendies, slowly heading up the green dollar hills towards you. All you gotta do is put money in and wait. If you're looking for FDs and quickly flipping shit, you might get lucky with some of these companies, but for the most part, all you gotta do is wait. Trust me, I know how difficult that can be when you're addicted to refreshing your account between every tug on your dick, but that's what this calls for. That means set your charts to daily or weekly and don't worry about a red day, there will be some of those along the way, maybe even red weeks, especially if some other populist cock gobbler decides to throw a wrench into the global economy or China does something retarded. Don't even worry about it until its warm enough to start breaking out flip flops again. Alright? Steel hands guys, steel hands. This isn't tech where you throw up a couple more servers, hire more people, and suddenly call yourself scaled up. No, it takes a long time for iron to be busted out of a mine, get shipped, be processed, and sold. So this isn't a good candidate for YOLO unless you don't mind watching a YOLO in slow motion. No, this is a tycoon play where you put your money on the train and wait for it to arrive. 

Personally? I think end of Q2 and Q3 is where you'll see today's market catalysts show up as earnings, my earliest position is for May, and even that makes me a little nervous for how soon it really is, but I think that's when the feasting might start showing up in reports and I see it going well into 2022.   


**TL;DR** We gonna make money like a freight train; slow, steady, and loaded with more tendies than any rocket can carry. If you wanna hop on the freight train like some fucking hobo, then join Tycoon Gang. If you want to see my DD for Ships/Trains, Mines, and maybe even one for industrial services/suppliers, just call me autistic, not retarded. Also, if you think I've missed any good smokestack plays, drop them below.

Title: Doortrash: DD on the Most Ridiculous IPO of 2020
***TLDR For Those of You Who Can't Read:*** Doordash has been severely overvalued, taking advantage of COVID to IPO at all-time highs. They even admit to not being able to sustain their current revenue and costs in the future. Buy puts!

Positions: 1/15/21 120p, 2/19/21 120p

Doordash is a technology company that connects people with the best in their cities. -- [Doordash](https://www.doordash.com/about/)

Doordash has self-proclaimed itself as a tech company, and it seemingly has been able to receive a valuation indicating such. However, Doordash has found itself in the food delivery business, which is full of competition and little to no brand loyalty. This high level of competition makes it difficult to secure high margins and customers, both of which are required if $DASH ever hopes at becoming profitable. In fact, $DASH even says in their [S-1 filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-292381/), We have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3v6lays45e661.jpg?width=490&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74de7d1bec25abf5194cbe19fdf7e27121e979c1

Leading up to their IPO, $DASH faced several different valuations. First, their last private valuation ([Jun 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/19/doordash-scores-16-billion-valuation-now-top-of-food-delivery-chain.html)) placed them at $16 billion, which is reasonable, considering competitors GrubHub and Uber are valued at $7 billion and \~$11 billion respectively. This shows that even at the very height of the pandemic when revenue was highest and a quarterly profit was realized for the first time, investors only saw $DASH as a $16 billion company. However, when being [valued for an IPO](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/doordash-ipo-stock-offering-price-filing-dash-trading-debut-nyse-2020-12-1029875380?op=1) only 5 months later, $DASH was valued at $25 billion, then $29 billion, finally landing at an absurd $34 billion valuation, over double its value earlier in the year.

Direct competitors, including Grubhub Inc., Uber Technologies Inc., and the recently acquired Postmates, are typically valued at three to six times sales, Citron said in a research report. DoorDash was trading at 19 times. However, accounting standards can vary from company to company. -- [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/12/08/doordashs-new-valuation-is-even-more-ridiculous/?sh=2cf1a243b348)

The madness does not stop there. On IPO day, $DASH ballooned to $180 and has yet to see a green day prior to Friday. One could argue that a profitable second quarter is bullish, as it shows that the company is finally turning a profit, but they immediately returned to operating on a loss in Q3, despite revenue being propped up temporarily due to an increase in demand for their services under quarantine.

There is no coincidence that Doordash filed for an IPO in a year that saw record-breaking revenue growth amid a pandemic, something that is unsustainable in the future. By filing at the peak of their growth, $DASH can take advantage of the hype surrounding food delivery before they face the reality of a COVID-free economy.  Overall, $DASH has been riding the hype train, and as things slow down, expect their stock price to follow.

For those of you blaming MMs for everything, please read the brief following excerpt and do some research on your own (suggestions below).

"Ni, Pearson, and Poteshman (2005) show that the closing stock prices tend to cluster at option strike prices on the option expiration dates. They are, however, largely unable to resolve whether the pinning is caused by deliberate manipulation or as a natural by-product of the market maker delta hedging."

Further, you autists can read Krishnan and Nelken (2001), Avellaneda and Lipkin (2003), and Avellaneda, Kasyan, and Lipkin (2012) which examine and develop mathematical models of stock pinning and the role that delta-hedging has on pinning.

Title: VMware (VMW) Exploit Chaining in Combination with SolarWinds (SWI), What Does It Mean for Investors? CVE-2020-13169 and CVE-2020-14005
**TLDR**

The first impact on VMware (VMW) was Friday when Brian Krebs (World renowned Cyber Security Investigative Reporter known for highly effective campaigns in tracking and neutralizing cybercriminal threats) tied the SolarWinds (SWI) based hacks to the VMware vulnerabilities reported by the NSA. This combination of capabilities explains persistence and how it was formed.

VMware (VMW) dropped 5.6% by end of day after the publication of the Krebs article.

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/vmware-stock-falls-as-report-links-its-software-to-solarwinds-hack-51608327990](https://www.barrons.com/articles/vmware-stock-falls-as-report-links-its-software-to-solarwinds-hack-51608327990)

Patches already exist but VMware has found itself thrown into the fire of the SolarWinds hack. At this point since VMware was not a victim, but instead a utility, they may find themselves following the downward path of SolarWinds as the reputation of their Identity Management products takes a beating. 5.6% may be the beginning of a weeks long drop as customers reassess their ties to VMware identity management products and investors panic on the correlation to the SolarWinds hack.

**What is VMware?**

VMware provides the worlds premier virtualization software. "VMware, Inc. engages in the provision of cloud infrastructure and business mobility. Its products include Software-Defined Data Center, Hybrid Cloud Computing, and End-User Computing. It supports modernizing data centers, integrating public clouds, empowering digital workspaces and transforming security." -Forbes

**Who uses VMware?**

"More than 500,000 customers of all sizes have chosen VMware as their virtualization platform, including

 99 percent of Fortune 100 companies  
 99 percent of Fortune 500 companies  
 100 percent of Fortune Global 100 companies  99 percent of Fortune Global 500 companies"

VMware is also GSA approved and distributed through Dell (DELL), Carahsoft, and Ingram Micro/Promark and used by all levels of government and the US military.

[https://www.vmware.com/solutions/industry/government/federal-government-it-solutions.html](https://www.vmware.com/solutions/industry/government/federal-government-it-solutions.html)

**Who discovered the latest VMware vulnerabilities?**

The vulnerabilities were disclosed to VMware by the NSA. VMware subsequently disclosed to the public.

**What was the major exploit within VMware products?**

"A malicious actor with network access to the administrative configurator on port 8443 and a valid password for the configurator admin account can execute commands with unrestricted privileges on the underlying operating system."

[https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0027.html](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0027.html)

**How would someone be able to accomplish the exploit?**

You may be asking, how could someone accomplish a login to the administrative port of a VMware configuration with a valid password?

Well this is simple, SolarWinds Orion stores and utilizes the adequate credentials to monitor and maintain all devices placed within it's scope......including your VMware entities.

[https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success\_Center/orionplatform/Content/Core-Adding-VMware-Servers-for-Monitoring-sw89.htm](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success_Center/orionplatform/Content/Core-Adding-VMware-Servers-for-Monitoring-sw89.htm)

**So the VMware has been compromised, what can they really do?**

Through VMware Workspace One Access and VMware Identity Manager the actor is able to create unauthorized but VALID SAML tokens which enable authentication to network resources. Once an administrative level authentication is established to resources such as Active Directory the actor is able to create persistence.

"It is critical when running products that perform authentication that the server and all the services that depend on it are properly configured for secure operation and integration. Otherwise, SAML assertions could be forged, granting access to numerous resources. If integrating authentication servers with ADFS, NSA recommends following Microsofts best practices, especially for securing SAML assertions and requiring multi-factor authentication"

[https://media.defense.gov/2020/Dec/07/2002547071/-1/-1/0/CSA\_VMWARE%20ACCESS\_U\_OO\_195076\_20.PDF](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Dec/07/2002547071/-1/-1/0/CSA_VMWARE%20ACCESS_U_OO_195076_20.PDF)

**But did it really happen this way? Were the exploits chained?**

It seems so from all assessments. For all authenticators that could not be harvested from within SolarWinds, in the condition of existence of VMware Workspace One Access and VMware Identity Manager served as the final hurdle to full domain control.

"The exploitation occurs after the actors have gained initial access to a victims on-premises network. The actors leverage privileged access in the on-premises environment to subvert the mechanisms that the organization uses to grant access to cloud and on-premises resources and/or to compromise administrator credentials with the ability to manage cloud resources."

"In the first Tactics Techniques and Procedures, the actors compromise on-premises components of a federated SSO infrastructure and steal the credential or private key that is used to sign Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) tokens (TA00061, T1552, T1552.004). Using the private keys, the actors then forge trusted authentication tokens to access cloud resources. A recent NSA Cybersecurity Advisory warned of actors exploiting a vulnerability in VMware Access2 and VMware Identity Manager3 that allowed them to perform this Tactics Techniques and Procedures and abuse federated SSO infrastructure"

"Regardless of how the initial on-premises compromise occurred, detecting authentication abuse can aid in detecting the compromise and even contain it if responded to quickly enough. The recent SolarWinds Orion9 code compromise is one serious example of how on-premises systems can be compromised leading to abuse of federated authentication and malicious cloud access"

**Why would this shift VMware (VMW) stock price down if there is already a patch?**

VMware has gone from having patched an exploit disclosed to them by the NSA, to having been placed in the spotlight of previous and current utility by those that exploited the SolarWinds hack.

The NSA had already written very detailed documentation of how the VMware and SolarWinds exploits chained together but it had not proven digestible to most.

After Krebs wrote his article it brought up questions within consumers of VMware products of why they needed their version of identify as a service (IDaaS) for their single sign-on. This sentiment moved forward into investors and we saw a 5.6% drop in VMware (VMW) stock by end of day.

It is highly likely that as SolarWinds falls on news of the hack that now that VMware has been identified in the same exploit chain they may fall with it.

WMware thankfully were quick to disclose their own vulnerability, and none of their board attempted to exit their positions before that disclosure. This is the opposite of what had been done by SolarWinds, with whom they have now been linked by technical means.

We may see a further fall in VMware stock price on Monday and throughout the upcoming weeks as a result of the above information.

**Updates will come.**

As updates become available they will be posted here, either as edits or links to independent posts.

This post welcomes comments both technical and laymans level. Original posting has been made for the layman but open to questions to dig deeper.

Title: VMware (VMW) Exploit Chaining in Combination with SolarWinds (SWI) What Does It Mean for Investors
**TLDR**

First blood was drawn on VMware (VMW) Friday when Brian Krebs (World renowned Cyber Security Investigative Reporter known for highly effective campaigns in tracking and neutralizing cybercriminal threats) tied the SolarWinds (SWI) based attacks to the VMware vulnerabilities reported by the NSA. This combination of capabilities by attackers explains persistence and how it was formed.

VMware (VMW) dropped 5.6% by end of day after the publication of the Krebs article.

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/vmware-stock-falls-as-report-links-its-software-to-solarwinds-hack-51608327990](https://www.barrons.com/articles/vmware-stock-falls-as-report-links-its-software-to-solarwinds-hack-51608327990)

Patches already exist but VMware has found itself thrown into the fire of the SolarWinds hack. At this point since VMware was not a victim, but instead a utility, they may find themselves following the downward path of SolarWinds as the reputation of their Identity Management products takes a beating. 5.6% may be the beginning of a weeks long drop as customers reassess their ties to VMware identity management products and investors panic on the correlation to the SolarWinds hack.

Title: A WSB'rs Guide To Stimulus Negotiations
_tl;dr Money printer no longer go brrrrrr, money printer never really went brrrrr_

The news on early Sunday morning is that boomer Senator Pat Toomey is [turning off the money printer](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republican-democrats-reach-compromise-over-covid-19-stimulus-package-n1251837) so that it no longer goes brrrr:

&gt; This agreement rescinds more than $429 billion in unused CARES Act funds; definitively ends the CARES Act lending facilities by Dec. 31, 2020; stops these facilities from being restarted and forbids them from being duplicated without congressional approval," Toomey spokesperson Steve Kelly said.

So money printer no longer go brr? On fuck! This is the worst news since November when [Mnuchen asked the money printer to stop brrrrrrring!](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhansen/2020/11/19/mnuchin-asks-fed-to-return-unused-cares-act-funds-nixes-emergency-programs/?sh=1851e3d7305f) Remember what happened after that news? Markets tanked, the EV bubble popped, bears came out of hibernation and the crimson blood of bulls everywhere ran though the gutters.

Oh wait no the exact opposite happened. After markets threw a minor tantrum, and then TSLA got included and SPY went to ATH. This all the while [main street businesses got shafted](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhansen/2020/11/19/mnuchin-asks-fed-to-return-unused-cares-act-funds-nixes-emergency-programs/?sh=1851e3d7305f) as Mnuchin counted on the program expiring at the end of the year. So effectively we're looking at a January that'll have the same fundamentals as November/December.

Meanwhile, all you degenerates will get another $600 to buy your fractional $TSLA shares and continue pumping. Plus whatever "stimulus failure" was priced in is now off the table. In case it's not clear, I'm bullish on this news, and anyone shorting the market because some difunctional programs are off the table must be not be functional themselves. Maybe EV bubble pops or everyone dies mid-flight and causes a huge run on the market, but I don't think a downturn is going to be stimulus news.

Prepare yourself for the next shroom cloud.  MMED is up 990% in the last 6 months - and LOBE is poised to have the same. Quick gains for all. I jumped to LOBE from MMED after 500+% gain to this. 

Check out LOBE SCIENCES (LOBE . CN) - similar to MMED, in stage 2 for micro LSD treatments for ADHD, anxiety. Also has mdma development and cannabis research.

Title: How will TSLA trade differently after being added to the S&amp;P 500?
Kinda wondering if TSLA will still be a degenerate trading stock or will it calm down and follow the market more now that it is part of the index?   The best part about TSLA in my opinion was that it would not follow the SPY/futures.   Will TSLA move the SPY/futures or will the SPY move TSLA?   Curious what people think.

Title: Why the time to buy is now...
People are going to be seeing family for Xmas very soon.  Deep pocketed gay bears sitting on the side lines are going to hear the stories.  They are pissed.  They have FOMO.  They are going to corner their retarded nephews and get them to give them stock tips.  This will be they year that they go big.  The same logic that had them on the sidelines all 2020 long is gonna make them want to pump with the vaccine in 2021.  So much boomer cash is going to flood in.  Tell them what they want to know.  TSLA.  GME.  PLTR, etc. etc.  Just watch.  2020 is going to look like a year long dip by the time 2021 is done.

Title: Talk me out of YOLOing my life savings on QQQJ
Hello fellow autists and degenerates. Long time lurker, first time poster. I'd like to start off saying thank you, you retards have allowed me to make more in 9 months of trading than I did all year in my normal job. With this being said, my risk tolerance is finally increasing, which would be very good or very bad. I made the decision that I want to eat the "tendies". I want to go to Mars. I want to make my wife's boyfriend proud of me. I've heard rumblings of QQQJ, and how it literally CANNOT go tits up. So being the retard in training that I am, I strapped my football helmet on, wiped the drool from my chin, and placed the following orders:

24 contracts of the following: 
18 JUNE 21 32C
18 JUNE 21 34C
18 JUNE 21 35C

I need to be reaffirmed so I can take another 50k out of my savings account and full send QQQJ. What do we think? Is this boomer ETF retard proof? Or am I purchasing a one way ticket to the bottom of the sea?

Title: buy Walgreens($WBA) at near all-time low as covid vaccine will increase their foot-traffic by TEN FOLD for a couple of years. Earnings in 2 weeks expecting a pre ER rally.
This badly-beaten stock hasn't recovered since march and their relative strength line has been in a downtrend since the stock peaked back in 2015. It's at its lowest level in roughly 26 years. 

That's cuz they've been reporting low foot traffic for the past few quarters, but this covid vaccine will definitely make them busier than ever for couple of years and foot traffic will go off the charts as each person has to get 2 or more covid vax shots. 

They've partnered with Verizon to digitize their platform with 5g technology. They have reported 62 million app downloads and 3 million subscribers using their prescription platform. And with growing digital footprint they now do online same-day deliveries for all types of products from toilet paper to prescription pills. 

They also partnered with VillageMD and is expected to open up 500 to 700 doctor's offices in U.S. stores by 2025 which makes them the first retail pharmacy chain to operate FULL SERVICE medical clinics on a large scale.

They are one of the highest paying dividend stocks out there with a yield of almost 5%.

They got earnings on Jan 7.. expecting a pre ER run up to at least $50 and $70-$80 by mid 2021.

\+ last mile e-commerce delivery (=&gt; trunk delivery)

 Retards: Remote open of Trunk =&gt; Trunk delivery. No one knows about this concept well. It could be huge in china. Its crowded place with lot of people living in smaller sq mile (cities). And people do steal packages if left at door (more than here). If you want something securely delivered while you are at work like a new PS5 or that $500 apple headset and you are worried someone would steal from your doorway, you can get it delivered to your trunk.  With self driving it could do last mile pickup / delivery too. (they are investing in their own self driving chip)

$NIO is still at a discount. Could be 2x from here. 

Upcoming catalysts: 

1. Jan 9 NIO day. 
2. 2021 new sedan models. 
3. Europe expansion.

# LiDAR and Future Market Share

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ztmi5ayc58661.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b1aaf5f9f0d51d577acf329bc463546537cfbc9

**The global LiDAR market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 13.2% from 2019 to 2027 to reach USD 3.6 billion by 2027.**^(1) It can be hard to determine if this is an accurate projection as we have been living in a time period of exponential growth in various markets. The profitability of LAZR in this time period will also be determined by what percent of the LiDAR market they can secure for production. What we do know now is LAZR is producing proprietary LiDAR systems that outpace their competitors, and have a faster production timeline (2022 vs. Velodynes 2025 target).

&gt;*We have one of the most insane moats of any company at this stage, Russell said. Weve built out and pioneered core components ... building from the ground up. We have not used commodity parts. We have the largest patent portfolio in sensing systems, more than the top five other LiDAR R&amp;D efforts combined.* ^(2)

You can view Luminars patents here: [**https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Luminar+Technologies**](https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Luminar+Technologies)

# Competitors

The various competitors prevalent in the market are challenged to provide innovative offerings, which help consumers, address changing technologies, business practices, and security needs. A large number of notable players are based in Europe and are involved in offering advanced solutions for meeting the requirements across varied applications.

&gt;*The current market environment is witnessing intense competition between the key players for achieving market domination via enhancement of quality and product differentiation, thereby enabling the growing market consolidation through strategic initiatives such as alliances, mergers, and acquisitions. Industry participants have entered into strategic partnerships with suppliers and distributors to strengthen their product portfolio and geographical presence.* ^(1)

We can see LAZR is a heavy hitter right off the bat. Theyve been public for a year and a half and have already made several big moves in that time, the oldest being their transportation industry partners and more recently their deal with Mobileye. Their transition into public trading on Dec. 3rd showed the potential for this company as investors tripled the stock price.

# Current deals

* LiDAR production for Mobileye (a division of Intel)
* LiDAR production for Volvo fully autonomous driving

# Current speculation

After Citrons hit job (fuck you Citron) analysts have upgraded LAZR for a **$41 price target**. Read more here: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-luminar-lazr-stock-because-163420247.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-luminar-lazr-stock-because-163420247.html)

Im no scientist, however LAZRs LiDAR systems are supposedly more accurate and have longer visible range and response/processing time than their competitors. Read more here: [https://www.luminartech.com/technology/](https://www.luminartech.com/technology/)

# Future announcements

I discussed this a bit in my last post but this is what Im personally focused on.

This patent outlines a few key components we may very well see in the next decade (technology that LAZRs founder Austin Russell designed himself):

* **Personalized ads** on billboards/other surfaces via projection as your car is autonomously driven
* Remote car charging

Title: SolarWinds (SWI) isnt going anywhere
Ive been seeing the constant fear and crying of autists on here about the hack and how extensive it supposedly is. 

SolarWinds has a database performance management solution to fit your organization's needs. Cross-platform or SaaS-based, we've got you covered. SaaS-based infrastructure and application performance monitoring, tracing, and custom metrics for hybrid and cloud-custom applications. 

This is not a remote management application. SolarWinds is a monitoring and alerting application for administrators to keep on top of their network resources.

What you have here is a great buying opportunity. SolarWinds isnt going anywhere. There is nothing else out there like it to keep track of an entire network environment with the custom alerting and monitoring capabilities. 

In a statement Thursday afternoon, Microsoft said theres no evidence that hackers were able to use the digital beachhead to access its live online services or customer data, or to mount additional cyberattacks on others. However, the company acknowledged that the investigation is ongoing. - https://www.geekwire.com/2020/microsoft-says-internal-probe-finds-malicious-solarwinds-code-no-sign-impact-yet/

Title: FCEL bull flag breakout
I've been watching FCEL since it mooned after the Biden win and when it came back down after they announced an equity offering on Dec 2. Since then, it's been consolidating in a wedge pattern. It started to break out on Wednesday.

Important things are that it always found support at the 20SMA (red line) and volume is increasing as it broke out (bottom bars). Another important price is the $9.19 high price within the wedge. It's key that it manages to stay above that, and the longer it does, the higher the confidence of a breakout. On Friday, the morning pump got stalled right at 9.2, but it broke out on the 2nd try. On the way down in the afternoon market dump, it still never got too far below 9.2 before bouncing, which means there is buying at that level instead of selling now. Price target is $13 - $14.

Title: Potential for Massive Gains: Smart Packaging in Wake of a Pandemic,
This is my retarded DD on smart packaging - I am taking a look at potential economical effects of the COVID Crisis from a strategic perspective and there are certain facts which are hard to ignore and lead to a solid conclusion:

* The global food industry is doing well: Revenue in the Food market is projected to reach almost a trillion dollars with annual growth of a bit under 1%
* Snacks and Confectionary are the biggest segment within the food industry
* A shift towards the consumption of "convenience foods" from freshly cooked meals is increasing (largely due to lockdowns and the consequential failure of many restaurants in the coming year). But this trend was already on-going before the crisis, increasing steadily each year throughout the world.
* The packaged food industry is booming in the Asia pacific region

Conclusion: Smart Packaging is the future.

So you may ask, why am I talking about packaging and not food FMCG or food companies such as Kraft Foods, Tyson, Pepsi etc., simple, because they are also dealing with a lot of the fallout of the crisis. This doesn't mean they will neccessarily lose out due to these trends, but the potential for loss is just as high as for gains.

You may also ask for reasons why I am talking about SMART packaging?

* Smart packaging is a trend towards improved product safety
* It is an industry driven by rapid innovation
* Packaging is vital to keep quality between processing and usage by the customer
* Active Packaging - increasing shelf life of products
* Intelligent packaging - Monitoring all aspects of the product's life-cycle, sense, detect and record the environment and report this to the customer or the company
* Smart packaging is applied in dairy, meat, seafood, bakery, confectionary and drinks, which are all growing markets heavily dependant on quality
* The technology is nascent, but available

Most importantly: smart packaging will solve many of the new problems arising through the covid crisis, making the customer trust the product's quality and remove fear of pandemic related issues (such as infection, breaking of cooling chains, supply chain disruptions etc.)

There are many companies workin in this field, but here are a few that might be interesting:

* Sealed Air Corporation 
* Amcor Limited
* SIAD
* Chainpoint 
* Schreiner Group
* 3m
* TempTime Corporation
* PakSense
* American Thermal Instruments
* Avery Dennison Corp
* R.R. Donnelly Sons &amp; Company
* BASF SE
* International Paper
* Stora Enso
* Thin Film Electronics ASA

This is a long term play. Positions should be Sealed Air Corp , BASF, 3m, International Paper for calls 2022+ according to my (retarded) views.

[https://twitter.com/TonyCharts/status/1340412375967674371](https://twitter.com/TonyCharts/status/1340412375967674371)

I try to aim for high reward, low risk entries on stocks that have some sort of solid growth fundamental backdrop. That means either high growth rate in their sales, or high growth rate in sales AND EPS.

As always constructive criticism is welcome, and I hope you all have a great weekend.

Title: NVAX UK P3 Modeling (Results will come out next week with 90% plus efficacy)
So I ran a pretty detailed excel modeling of number of Covid cases in the P3 test population. Assuming 15% drop out rate, the lowest vaccine efficacy rate to have not produced &gt;50 cases by 12/19 is around 88 to 89% efficacy rate. Assuming 10% drop out rate, that lowest efficacy rate to have not produced &gt;50 cases by 12/19 is around 93 to 94% efficacy rate.

Now assuming 95% efficacy and 15% drop out rate, reach 50 by dec 21, 90% efficacy and 15% is dec 20, 85% efficacy and 15% is Dec 18.

Assuming 95% eff and 10% drop, reach 50 by Dec 20, 90% eff and 10% drop by dec 18, 85% eff and 10% drop is Dec 17.

Now crazy scenario of 100% with 10% drop is Dec 21, and 100% with 15% drop is dec 23.

Assuming that they have to release the info within 3 days....the latest the report can come out on is Dec 26 or by the Monday after the next.  However, most likely the report will be reported at the later part of next week with efficacy rate of 90% plus.

Title: MSFT, Technicals
Ok retards, this is my first and maybe only post, so lets make it count!

I have been at this trading game for a while, mostly looking at a confluence of technical analysis and sometimes fundamentals.

It has since come to my attention the MSFT will be giving some free money in the next few weeks. Now I know that details doesn't matter here, so I will keep it short.

Please take a look at the daily chart and observe that this company is having a breakout on the 217 level. It is also confirmed wit a nice upward pinbar and some larger than usual volumes. This along with all the other techs looking ready for another run up is enough to have me quite excited :)

Now I know this is a boomer stock, but remember free money is free money. This will probably not lead to an early retirement, but my guess is that you could at least double your money on a C230 or C240 expiring 15/01/2021.

Just be sure to sell on +-100% gains because I'm not sure it will reach those strikes. You're welcome!

Coverage at [https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/keu3ca/pltr\_will\_moon\_soon\_i\_got\_proof/](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/keu3ca/pltr_will_moon_soon_i_got_proof/)

**New Government contract announcements**:

Palantir is helping State and International Governments manage their Covid-19 response. This includes outbreak detection, medical supplies production, hospital capacity, PPE distribution, vaccine development and distribution, contract tracing, and more.

This often represents the first time those Governments have seen Palantir in action. Having now experienced the speed and capabilities of Palantir's software, these Governments will likely seek additional Palantir partnerships. This real-world, global demo represents exponential contract growth potential.

&amp;#x200B;

**Even more new Government contract announcements**:

SolarWinds hack + "cyber security agenda" of incoming US Government = Palantir opportunity. Palantir has intrusion detection, monitoring, and best practices products ready to deploy. Palantir's Cyber solution can be added on top of competitor products for layered security.

Title: Bayer's way back up 
Good afternoon fellow degenerates

Put down the crayons and stop snorting glue for two minutes cos i've got a travel recommendation for you all. ''What? Travel recommendation?  But I don't even open the curtains, let alone leaving my wife's boyfriend's appartment''.  Yes I hear you. Whether you want to travel to tendietown , lamboland or the goddamn moon; this baby will take you there so listen up. I gotta warn you that this is not a play for 'tards with a concentration span shorter than 5 days. IF your concentration span is longer than that keep reading because after all we are more powerful than any investment firm.

here we go;  
\*\*What is Bayer AG?\*\*  
Bayer AG is an international holding with a wide variety of chemical products subdivided in Healthcare, Crop Sciences and Pharmaceuticals. The Crop Sciences division accounts for roughly 45% of the revenue and was given a boost after the takeover of Monsanto back in 2018. The division Pharmaceuticals focuses on the development of new treatments and accounts for 41% of the revenue.The division healthcare produces Bayer's classics that are no longer patent protected like aspirin and probably heroin too.

\*\*Why does Bayer trade under 50 right now?\*\*  
This is a good one; back in 2018 Bayer AG took over Monsanto aka the monster that brought Roundup upon us. Even though Roundup is still freely available in most European countries, Americans have collectively decided that Roundup is evil. This is mostly because it gave them the opportunity to sue Bayer and get tendies. After all,  american courthouses are the States' favorite casinos, in a close second to WSB.  Sue anyone over anything and get tendies. Just a few months ago it started to look like the American government was about to come to a mindblowing settlement of 12 billion dollars.

In the process of coming to a settlement Bayer stock came close to its pre-covid price of 80. Then, a bunch of States decided that 12 billion is **insufficient,** refused to settle for now and are aiming for more tendies. This caused the Bayer stock to fall back to 40 which is obviously unreasonably low despite the round-up process.  Before Bayer took over Monsanto and got dragged into the whole round-up nonsense Bayer traded between 110 and 120 per share. Even now, when Bayer trades around 40-50 the numbers are looking quite steady.

\*\*Numbers;\*\*  
Although I  am convinced half the people on this sub can barely read or count numbers without an abbacus I'll bless the more gifted ones with some numbers.

||*2017*|*2018*|*2019*|*2020*|*2021* *exp*.|*2022 exp.*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Ebitda M**|9288|14685|11503|11599|11649|12419|
|**Operating result M**|8391|8333|9709|7899|7491|8604|
|**Earnings before Tax M**|3122|6212|8668|7309|6483|7929|
|**Net profit M**|5881|5589|6285|6102|5994|6617|
|**p/e**|15,69|10,20|11,38|7,77|7,69|7,11|
|**p/share**|6,63|5,94|6,4|6,31|6,38|6,9|

Not looking too bad right?  Considering Bayer had 18 billion US Dollars cash on hand as of September 2020 the settlement will be a setback but not a major problem. Not to mention that the whole Monsanto thing has been priced in a little too well by now. Bayer, who also suffered from a covid drop is now trading incredibily cheap and the only way from here seems to be up.

\*\*Is this only about round-up or is Bayer also doing stuff these days?\*\*  
They sure are but I am not going to type out every damn news article about Bayer.Most recently they got authorized to develop medication against tumorsin collaboration with Atara Biotherapeutics.  Although  Bayer's revenue is expected to decrease this quarter, 2021 is looking a lot brighter and this stock is on its way back to 70 if not higher. Considering the surge December 16, I'd wait for a minor short squeeze and then take positions.

TL;DR; Bayer is unreasonably low priced and will fly over the course of 2021. Get shares, get options and let's visit the moon boys.

Position {order};  BYQ 17 sep 2021 54,00  
 I am considering gettings some common shares too

Title: Tesla buying Ford will be a disaster
Recently some analysts have said TSLA should use its high stock price to buy F and get the scale to match the valuation. This looks like a desperate cry from old school analysts who are just not being able to figure out the P/E of TSLA and want to merge it with a low P/E company to get an average P/E in line with their models.

This would be an absolute disaster for TSLA for 2 reasons - Unions and Dealers

First lets talk about Unions and off book liabilities None of the existing car manufacturers are actually  profitable or cash flow positive. They fake their books to show cash flow and profit by moving Union liabilities off book. All Union shops have huge retirement and healthcare liabilities. This is like saying the US govt has no deficit as Social Security and Medicare liabilities are in the future and in the present SS and Medicare are cash flow positive.

TSLA is the only profitable car maker in the world. Is it such a surprise that their valuation is in a different category from the rest?

Second dealers.

Dealers make their money on service not sales. EVs dont need much service as they have far fewer parts and most parts are electronic not mechanical. So selling EVs is bad business for dealers as a result they sabotage EV sales. Even if an ICE car company creates a great EV it just wont sell as the dealers will sabotage it. Legacy car companies are stuck with their dealerships due to legal contracts and cannot sell EVs directly to consumers. TSLA can

If TSLA were to takeover a legacy manufacturer it would infect TSLA with both of these liabilities.

Positions - Short TSLA if there is even a hint of TSLA trying to buy F Else long TSLA

Title: LKNCY to the moon! New financial info on investor relations page!
So, for those not in yet, I dont think its too late. LKNCY had a little fraud problem this year crushing the stock from its high of around $49 to its low of $0.95.. soo that sounds like they got punished for it.. the company cut the head off its leadership and hired auditors to revaluate the company and settle with regulators. They settled in China a while back with a slap on the wrist and this week they settled with the SEC for $180M which honestly isnt that bad..

The auditors released a presentation on their investor relations page: 
https://investor.luckincoffee.com/static-files/177f69c0-b876-407e-ae2f-40f032af1ebd

Which is where I am getting my numbers from 

Anyway the moral of the story is that even after the run this week their market cap is only ~$2.38B (TDAmeritrade overview page) implying that based on the presentations revised 2020 FY revenue LKNCY is trading at 3.57x revenue!! Idk about you but that is a screaming buy!! 


Im just tryin like everyone else on here so check my math and tell me if Im autistic or retarded! 

4.2B RMD is 2020 revenue 

Thats 4,200,000,000 RMD x 0.15 (conversion to USD) = 642,496,554

$2.38B is market cap as of yesterday 

So, $2,380,000,000 / 642,496,554 = 3.57x 2020 FY Revenue

Title:   SolarWinds (SWI) BUY YOUR PUTS  Negative Impacts, Negligence, CEO Dumps then Runs
TLDR....BUY YOUR FUCKING PUTS this dumpster fire has not reached full flame and this is only the beginning.

[https://www.businessinsider.com/solarwinds-hack-will-take-years-to-investigate-experts-say-2020-12](https://www.businessinsider.com/solarwinds-hack-will-take-years-to-investigate-experts-say-2020-12)

This is no normal hack, this is not a retail store, THIS IS A COMPANY TRUSTED WITH THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM OF THE IT SYSTEMS OF THE BIGGEST PLAYERS IN THE US GOVERNMENT AND ECONOMY.

We don't know how big the flames of this dumpster fire will continue to grow to, but the brand has been tarnished, customers are being ordered to disconnect (NOT PATCH) affected systems, the CEO dumped over 20% of his holdings before the announcement on his way our the door........IT LOOK LIKE TIME FOR PUTS

**What is SolarWinds?**

SolarWinds provides network monitoring and management tools at a "God View", utilized by over 300,000 clients.

"In a nutshell, SolarWinds' Orion product provides centralized monitoring across an organization's entire IT stack. That means the attackers who were able to compromise this platform had an extremely high level of access to all of these client systems," David Kennedy, CEO of TrustedSec

&amp;#x200B;

**Who is affected?**

Over 425 of the Fortune 500.

US government entities such as DHS and DOJ.

All branches of the US military.

&amp;#x200B;

"SolarWinds currently believes the actual number of customers that may have had an installation of the Orion products that contained this vulnerability to be fewer than 18,000." SolarWinds, Per report to SEC

SolarWinds is now hiding who is affected by removing information of high profile customers!!

**How bad could the impact to customers be?**

According to a report by Politico following a National Security Council, an official was quoted as saying "This is probably going to be one of the most consequential cyberattacks in U.S. history."

[https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/14/massively-disruptive-cyber-crisis-engulfs-multiple-agencies-445376](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/14/massively-disruptive-cyber-crisis-engulfs-multiple-agencies-445376)

Government entities are NOT being ordered to update/downgrade to unaffected versions, they are being told, "Disconnecting affected devices, as described below in Required Action 2, is the only known mitigation measure currently available."

[https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/21-01/](https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/21-01/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Was there widespread Negligence?**

According to numerous reports SolarWinds has been breached before, with access to their systems being sold on underground markets. Beyond this, these rocket surgeons even used passwords for FTP servers like "solarwinds123"

[https://www.newsweek.com/notorious-hacker-fxmsp-sold-access-solarwinds-machines-report-1555061](https://www.newsweek.com/notorious-hacker-fxmsp-sold-access-solarwinds-machines-report-1555061)

&amp;#x200B;

**CEO and others dumped?**

The now former CEO dumped over 20% of his holdings between 11AUG2020 and 19NOV2020.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/insiders/thompson-kevin-b-415607](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/insiders/thompson-kevin-b-415607)

The now former CEO was not the only one to dump his holdings.

On December 7, Silver Lake sold $158 million in shares, while Thoma Bravo sold $128 million in shares on the same day. 

Three executives from each firm sit on the board of SolarWinds and they have been the largest investors in the company since it went public in 2018.

[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9060931/Two-SolarWinds-investors-sold-280million-stock-days-Russian-cyber-attack-revealed.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9060931/Two-SolarWinds-investors-sold-280million-stock-days-Russian-cyber-attack-revealed.html)

If these trades were executed to prevent losses due to a planned disclosure of the months old exploit, then this would represent massive wrongdoing. This would not be the first time they were accused of such.

&amp;#x200B;

**Incoming lawsuits?**

In 2016 SolarWinds found themselves facing a lawsuit accusing them of "violating federal securities laws by misleading investors about its financial condition."

It further accused "SolarWinds and its executives of making false and misleading statements and failing to disclose material adverse facts about the companys operations. Specifically named in the lawsuit are SolarWinds CEO Kevin Thompson and chief financial officer Jason Ream."

Now SolarWinds is facing a lawsuit on the behalf of shareholders again.

I'll keep this short and simple, $ABBV and $RUN. 

$ABBV [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ABBV](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ABBV) on the daily chart, it ended on a hammer

$RUN [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RUN&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RUN&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d)  amazing looking wedge, broke to $67 today, a few more days and it'll moon even harder.   


  
$ABBV- has been doing amazing lately, beating their competition. Overall moon  
$RUN- broke to $67 today, I have a PT of high 70's  


TLDR:   
$RUN 1/15/21 80c (you can go further back to play it more safe)  
$ABBV 12/31 108c, 109c (you can go further back too)

Title: PLTR getting ready
Alright I made this using MS paint because I am too retarded to use photoshop. Short interest died on 20th of November then literally the next trading session (that following Monday) started that week of back to back 10-20% gains. We just saw the same death in short interest recently. That coupled with the fact that fidelity literally has 0 shares available to short and other brokerages are low/out of shares to short makes me think maybe next week will be PLTR week

&amp;#x200B;

Edit cause bears gotta be : 

Lockup will have 3 days after their Q4 earnings release probably sometime in Feb2021 the number of outstanding shares to be traded will go from .5b to about 1.7b. This might seem bad but if you are concerned you just need to look at snowflake's recent lockup expiration to get an idea of what might happen.

Snowflake had a partial lockup release earlier this week and their float went from 32.2M to a total of 110.6M overnight. This is roughly a 3.4x increase in float volume. PLTR is going from \~.5B to \~1.7B float (a 3.4x increase in float). When the lockup expired for SNOW their SP dropped by \~15% and it is now recovering. So we can expect a \~15% drop once this lockup is done.

Title: We getting STIMULUS!
Anyone who was keeping tabs with the market realizes theres something brewing. In the last ten minutes, Dow went up 200 points all of a sudden, most stocks have a big green candle out of nowhere too, due to this. 

I say: this is indicative of the impending stimulus to be executed either later this day or during the weekend which will contribute to the ritualistic GAP UP Monday. I hope this causes a similar market to may-July, where everything was HOT, and so many runners out of nowhere.

Thoughts?

Title: FB tendies incoming. Warren says to BTFD
FB recently dipped on FUD of anti trust lawsuits and Apple potentially removing facebook ads.  This is actually an amazing buy the dip opportunity.

Bull case:

1. Stonks are fueled by hate. For example, the more shorts in TSLA, the harder it flew.

2. As we know, stonks go up and that goes double for FAANGS.

3. Tipranks has consensus analyst price target at $321.  Current price $275.

The senate chads ain't breaking up shit.  They hold tons of FB, and are just pandering to the sheep, while simultaneously buying the dip.

Positions:
275c 1/15/21

Title: Oracle $orcl - cheap January play
Oracle - the boomer cloud stock everyone forgot about after the Tik Tok debacle 

$orcl has a few interesting things going on

1) lots of unusual option activity

2) likely to be making some big acquisition news, given the 180 sentiment change that Salesforce received after acquiring Slack 

3) outperforming a lot of its peers since its earnings last week


$orcl - Jan 15 $70C are still super cheap and seems like a no brainer

Title: TAK heading to the moon 
Alright, I'll keep this short and sweet since I know you retards can't read anyway. 

Takeda Pharmaceutical (TAK), largest Pharma company in Japan and top 20 pharma company in the world by revenue was just granted a priority review by the FDA for their drug. 

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-food-drug-administration-accepts-130500633.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-food-drug-administration-accepts-130500633.html)

The drug is designed to fight the eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), chronic inflammatory disease. 

"*The FDA grants* ***Priority Review*** *for medicines that, if approved, have the potential to offer significant advances in the safety or effectiveness of the current treatment approaches. TAK-721 previously received both Breakthrough Therapy designation and Orphan Drug designation from the FDA.*"

Now you ask, why the fuck do I care about this? Not a boomer, won't die from it. Fair. But you like Tendies. See below.

ARK funds has almost **DOUBLED** their holdings of TAK over the last two weeks alone and more than **TRIPLED** since October. 

10/02/20 - 1.2M Shares  
12/04/20 - 2.4M shares - (2 months to buy 1.2M shares)  
12/17/20 - 5.47M shares (2 weeks to buy 3M+ shares)

If they get this FDA approved (granted FDA priority review) it is going to be HUGE for them. 

Weeklies, monthlies, leaps......all are cheap rn. Hop on the rocket before it's too late. Elon is waiting on Mars. 

TLDR: TAK -&gt;  -&gt;  

Title: FUBO - Gravy Train to Tendy Town
Listen up you sad sacks of missing chromosomes, FUBO TV is headed to the Androdema galaxy. In fact, it's ticker stands for "F*cking Unreal Bigly Options." I've been printing with PINS, NIO, CRWD, and NET since early 2020 so figured I'd share this next pick.

I know you retards don't read much, so **TLDR: BUY FUBO, it has bigly upside with tiny downside. It's a sports streaming company that fused with a sports betting company.**

**Positions: 1000 shares @ $19.43 avg, 5x Dec 2021 $30 LEAPs.**

For those who can read at a 2nd grade level:

Netflix has regular cable and Fubo TV basically has the market by the nutsack for sports streaming. It's product is smooth, continuously being improved, and people who have it love it. Even though it currently has a $64.99 monthly price, people are still flocking because people who watch sports usually spend most of their time doing that to imagine what their highschool football career could have resulted in. Pathetic, but that's what allows us to ride the gravy train to Androdema.

For perspective, the average revenue per user has gone from 2018: $37.93 2019: $53.73 3rd Quarter 2020: $67.70

Impressive, right? Some may cal that retard strength. What about revenue? 2018: $74.8 million 2019: $146.5 million 2020: BIGLY GROWTH, TBD. Not to mention analysts have been loving this with price targets up to $40.

On top on all this, FUBO is engulfing retards left and right. It combined with Facebank AG, the company who did the Tupac halogram at Coachella and purchased Balto sports, a sports betting company competing with Draftkings. Combine retards watching sports with lots of money since they went into Finance instead of pursuing their true dream and direct marketing for sports betting and you have a Powell money printer.

Stack this with it's Glassdoor info: 91% recommend working at Fubo 100% approve of the CEO, David Gandler

It's been shown time and time again how much influence proper working conditions have on stock growth. When people feel like a team and approve of the CEO, they get retard strength and grow.

Finally, the market cap of this stock is ~$2.5 billion. While this won't be a Netflix with a market cap of $250billion, it is FAR from it's peak.

Hop onto the gravy train straight to tendy town so we can win back our wives. 

LET'S GO

Edit: Bold to help illiterates find key points. Also added recent analyst news.

Title: rsted getting blown to Valhalla
OK I'll keep this DD short because I haven't really done much.

Orsted (DNNGY, formerly DONG \[lol\]) is the largest offshore wind developer in the world with 16% market share. I think clean energy investments are already a good idea and I'm boomered into several clean energy ETFs already...QCLN, TAN, FAN, etc.

Why is Orsted going to be one of the best companies going forward?

\-There are 9 offshore wind farms going up off the Atlantic coast with estimated completion between 2023 and 2025; Orsted is developing 5 of them. When all the local news articles start coming out and idiots overwhelm the comments with talk of fish cancer, smart boomers are gonna invest.

\-New CEO Mads Nipper (Mads Lad) has already doubled their share price since he started in January. He also doubled the share price of his former company Grundfos and was the marketing director for LEGO. He's also an AC/DC fan (high voltage = high gains)

\-I think a Biden administration will increase the odds of these projects actually happening, but the company is majority-owned by the Danish government, and even if the US fucks up the shift to clean energy, Orsted will be successful elsewhere in the world. The Danes aren't stupid and have skin in the game. (Again, LEGO)

\-Orsted has a goal of net-zero carbon emission by 2025 and is likely one of the only companies who've made a pledge like this that can actually do it.

\-A downside you guys might not like is there's no options trading, but they account for something like 8% of FAN which does.

tl;dr: Mads Lad CEO, everyone living on the east coast will be hearing about this company in the next year or two, pumping DONG, LEGO is cool, kill the birds for their tendies

Title: Why ArcelorMittal ($MT) will not capture rising iron ore prices, but $VALE will
I'll keep this short because I know you autists have attention issues. This short piece builds on the work of others: [u/peperrinaa](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kenda2/buy_vale_vale_ironnickelcopper_you_like_steel_buy/) &amp; [u/imsohonky](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kf1bt1/dd_why_you_should_be_playing_vale_instead_of_mt/)

There is a massive and increasing demand for Iron ore, currently primarily fueled by Chinese demand. The Chinese have initiated a massive infrastructure stimulus to boost their economy after covid. More infrastructure bills are expected in for example the US (Biden's new deal or whatever).

Due to global supply chain issues and again, covid, the supply is currently limited and there are legitimate concerns for further disruptions.

This combination of increasing demand and limited supply is driving the price of iron ore up, and the structural nature of these issues means that we can expect iron ore prices to continue climbing.

But here is why steel producers will not capture this increased demand, and iron miners will:

Since the last two times we saw a similar spike in iron prices, China has significantly ramped up production of steel: [https://tradingeconomics.com/china/steel-production](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/steel-production). The Chinese do not need to buy steel for their infrastructure plan, but they do need to buy Iron. China is the world third largest producer of iron ore, but still imports around 70% of global seaborne iron ore.

Title: Cloud / Cyber Security - Splk
Hello fellow Turds,

With the recent hack attack, boomers are now realizing importance of cyber security. It is a good time to place your bets on cloud/ cyber security providers. Now all of y'all are going to jump in tits up in pltr and obviously most of y'all will end up bag holders.

Popular candidate at least for silicon valley is Splunk- slpk. It is available at a bargain price right now. With a morning star fair value at 208, it is really a bargain for the cheap tards among you. 

Why so cheap you ask?

It fell after last earnings as some contracts which should have been in place 3rd quarter were postponed. These are already executed this quarter. So, outlook for next earnings looks good. Couple that with arriving stimulus/ vaccine and overall optimism on macro, y'all have a deal of life time.

Won't go into basics(you can read at any finance website or check analyst ratings) but company has good financials overall though might be over reinvesting. 

Now for the real wsbers: why can it achieve the retard strength and take you to tendieland? It doesn't have a very high market cap, initial price movement should come easier and the name of the company is Splunk ffs, it is meant to be a meme.

TLDR: Sell your house, buy SPLK

Title: Profiting off the hack of the decade - SUNBURST
The Russians hacked everything and everyone in-the-know is shitting bricks.... [at least 40 high profile targets](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/), secret meetings in congress,  [senators tweeting scary things](https://twitter.com/SenBlumenthal/status/1338972186535727105), [emergency cyber directives](https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/21-01/), [demands to clean up, raise defenses and strike back](https://twitter.com/SenBlumenthal/status/1339585093170446342) are all leading to what is likely a bonanza of classified emergency funding authorizations across the US governments and top US and allied firms.  Shit is about to get real and as the details of this hack continue to be uncovered, money is gonna start flowing creating pandemic-level investing opportunities.. the question is.. where..

For that, it helps to understand the government's [process for responding to cybersecurity incidents](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf).  To save you some reading, the most relevant parts are:  1) Detect the attack 2) Contain the damage 3) Eradicate the attacker 4) Recover from the attack and Prepare to prevent the next one.    Each phase of this process is going to favor particular players.  Here is who:

**Detect and Contain**

$FEYE - These guys detected what the CIA, NSA, DHS and everyone else missed.  FireEye/Mandiant are THE company you bring in when you have a major breach and were the ones to discover that the Russians backdoor'ed SolarWinds software.  Simply put, they are the best in the world at Detect and Contain.  Their phone is now ringing off the hook with panicked companies and government agencies willing to pay nearly anything for them to find the well hidden hackers on their network.

**Eradicate and Recover**

These attackers are in so deep and are so stealthy, that fully eradicating the them is going to mean completely rebuilding massive computer networks.  When NotPetya was unleashed on the world, recovery cost FedEx $400 million and Maersk $300 million.  We could see similar levels of spend at some impacted entities.

$LDOS, $GD, $NOC, $BAH - [These guys are top government contractors](https://www.cyberscoop.com/six-big-vendors-dominate-a-fragmented-federal-cybersecurity-market-numbers-show/) that have skills in cyber defense, the feds are comfortable with them and have contract vehicles to quickly start throwing money their way.  As someone who responds to cybershit for a living, its hard to overstate the amount of work it will take to rebuild computer networks hit by this attack.  The government will need an army of contractors to surge remediation personnel and it will take months.

**Revenge**

[Biden is already promising retaliation](https://www.axios.com/biden-fireeye-solarwinds-hack-retaliation-1d9eac1e-a454-43cf-9241-10c05b2d7586.html) and for anyone that paid attention during the Snowden revelations, we know that $BAH is balls deep in with the NSA on the offensive side the house.  Surging offensive capacity is going to be a good thing for the folks at Booze.

**Never Again**

Detecting and defending against cyber attacks like this is f'ing hard.  Defenders need advanced training and technology. Autist favorite $PLTR is going to be a favorite here.   Not only does the government love them, their platform has a proven track record of uncovering hard to detect attacks like [ghosnet](https://www.palantir.com/wp-assets/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ImpactStudy_GhostNet.pdf) and Shadow Network.  Business is about to get really good at Palantir as government agencies like DOE, Treasury, DHS and others double-down on their software and services to put AI and ML detection technologies in place.  So... as y'all say  PLTR to the moon!!

TL/DR

This hack is a HUGE deal.  Congress is going to start dumping money.  That money is going to go to a handful of firms.  Buy $FEYE, $PLTR, $BAH, $LDOS and other government cybersecurity contractors.

Title: MT UPDATE: A message from u/VitoCorlene
The prophet u/VitoCorlene was auto banned for posting an article, but here are his words.   


"ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) reportedly has raised its Europe-wide hot-rolled coil and hot-dip galvanized coil offers to 700/ton and 800/ton, respectively, for April-May deliveries. The price hike continues the current rally in the European steel market, where HRC prices are now at a nine-year high, according to S&amp;P Global Platts. The price increase marks ArcelorMittal's third in less than a month, amounting to a cumulative 150/ton jump; the company announced it was targeting 650/ton for European HRC on Dec. 4, helping propel the market higher. ArcelorMittal's recent price increases have been far more successful than those tabled over 2019, as buyers negotiating 2021 prices have been left with little room to maneuver, given the surging spot market and higher contract settlements with general industry participants." (12/17)

He plans to continue posting as soon as he can.

**TL;DR** 

MT - Increasing their prices, again - 3rd time this month   


**General updates below:**

Title: KAZ Minerals Merger Arbitrage Trade
KAZ Minerals is a copper miner listed on the London Stock Exchange. (This is listed in UK so if you do not have access to the UK market feel free to skip reading)

KAZ Minerals is currently undergoing a takeover offer from a large shareholder (who is also a Kazakhstani oligarch) and the CEO (who is also the oligarch's friend). The takeover offer stands at 6.40 GBP per share which materially undervalues the firm given the recent strong run in copper prices. Several shareholders expressed opposition to the deal with undervaluation the main reason for opposition.

The Kazakhstani oligarch and CEO want to take the firm private at a bargain price ahead of a major bull run in copper and a decarbonization cycle which will support the metal. Throughout 2019 and 2020, scandals relating to soviet and Kazakhstani oligarchs, suspected money laundering schemes of corrupted officials have led to significantly increasing distrust from UK/western authorities, I believe this could support any legal battles and opposition.

Stock currently trades at 6.50 GBP (downside limited to 6.40 GBP because of the offer, whereas the potential upside could be between 20% - 25%) and presents approximately 15:1 reward-risk ratio. This is based on a chart-overlay with COPX (copper miners ETF), which tightly correlates with KAZ Minerals.

Title: Why invest in Palantir? 360 tech firm that's gonna revolutionize every industry (amazing dd inside)
AUTOMOTIVE
Since 2017, Palantir has partnered with Scuderia Ferrari to integrate and analyze performance data in order to make faster, more data-driven decisions.
Throughout its lifetime, a vehicle generates a massive amount of data. From initial design to production and assembly, through marketing and sales, and eventually in use on the road, this data can provide valuable insight into quality, safety, and performance. But processing and integrating vehicle data takes time and effort that could otherwise be spent diagnosing complex problems.

SKYWISE
Skywise connects the aviation value chain in a secure ecosystem thats transforming how the industry uses data.
Now, airlines can use massive-scale sensor data, maintenance systems, aircraft schedules, passenger bookings, and more in one environment. On top of this data asset, Skywise offers a diverse analytical suite for operators to make sense of that data in both code-free and code-based environments.

CYBER
With the uptick in high-profile data breaches, organizations with large networks are working hard to guard against advanced intruders who identify and exploit complex vulnerabilities on the most important systems. But often, a tunnel vision focus on sophisticated attacks distract organizations from more basic problems, like stale passwords or machines that haven't been patched against months-old vulnerabilities, that leave them just as vulnerable to attack.

FINANCIAL COMPLIANCE 
Financial institutions with complex portfolios and high volumes of trades and transactions are often buried under petabytes of data, incompatible systems, and complicated customer landscapes. As this data grows in size and complexity, so does the regulatory landscape, and traditional tools can't keep.

INSURANCE
Key players in insurance are using Palantir Foundry to optimize every stage of the value chain: from underwriting and pricing through to policy administration, claims handling, risk management, and reserving.

LAW ENFORCEMENT 
For federal and local law enforcement agencies, Palantir Law Enforcement equips officers and agents with the tools they need to easily analyze intelligence, securely collaborate on investigations, manage cases, produce reports, and respond to crime as it happens.

MANUFACTURING
The most critical challenges facing manufacturers throughout the value chain are, fundamentally, data challenges. Supply chain, procurement, quality control, efficiency, rapid troubleshooting, and demand forecasting depend on an accurate and up-to-date data landscape

PHARMA
Pharmaceutical companies need an accurate, detailed picture of patient experience and outcomes in both clinical trials and the real world to develop and deliver effective drugs. However, analyzing real-world data for differentiated biomedical insight requires dealing with tremendous scale and complexity, as well as potential privacy concerns. Claims data, for example, is on the order of billions of rows, and genomics data can contain thousands of features per patient.

LEGAL INTELLIGENCE
For legal professionals building complex cases, Palantir Legal Intelligence enables the discovery of patterns of behavior and links between key actors that lie hidden in vast amounts of structured and unstructured dataLawyers handle massive volumes of data from many sources. Many types of data that lawyers routinely encounter complicate traditional research methods.

MERGERS &amp; ACQUISITIONS
Mergers and acquisitions fundamentally change companies, their strategies, and their technology landscapes. Whether it's a one-time transaction or part of a broader M&amp;A strategy, acquiring companies end up with fragmented systems that inhibit visibility into their newly unified organization's data. At the most critical juncture since their founding, companies are forced to prioritize systems decisions over business ones.

SALES AND REVENUE
Across industries, the competitive landscape changes quickly and organizations need to adapt faster than ever before. Delivering the right products and services requires granular insight into changes in customer behavior and dynamic ways to test and deploy new sales strategies.

Title: $Teck not Tech - Commodity Club
Welcome Commodity Club investors. Here's an introduction to the next 10x to add to your portfolio. Let's get started. 

**^(Disclaimer)**^(: I work in healthcare and not in mining. I've also been a TECK investor since 2016.) 

**Background**: 

$TECK - Teck Resources is a large Canadian miner that focuses in Copper, Zinc, Coking Coal, and Bitumen (Asphalt) mining. It's Canada's 20th largest company (as of 2019) and it's largest miner (Barrick Gold @ #2). It has an interesting history - in 2008, they nearly went bankrupt and were bailed out by Chinese investors (they bought 17% of the company), and was further reiterated by electing a Chinese Official to it's board of directors in 2016. 

The easiest way to explain TECK is that it's a large Canadian miner that has close ties with China. 

**Fundamentals**: 

I've listed to TECK's earnings calls and read their quarterly reports so you don't have to. However, it's best to start with TECK's history. Here's a summary of their scale: 

&amp;#x200B;

[2015-2019 Production by Commodity ](https://preview.redd.it/0782nlnseu561.png?width=810&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae38ebf5c8083015800ff12d49ffc8a759927245)

All you ESG (Environmental, social and corporate governance) know that no one likes to touch coal (which is massively undervalued btw - coking coal, not thermal coal - there's a difference), but let's ignore that bit for a minute. TECK was the top mining company in the DJOW Sustainability index for 2019, and on the list for 10 straight years. 

First thing to call out - TECK's output is stable - it hasn't really changed an any area except Bitumen (Asphalt) in the past 5 years. 

Here's TECK's 2020 H2 numbers (let's forget Q1/2): 

&amp;#x200B;

[H2 Guidance from October 26](https://preview.redd.it/5hvrnguaju561.png?width=627&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad4a6cb53a346bbfcf656d005d185b725188730f)

TECK's production is largely stable across quarters, so what does this insight show us: 

* Steelmaking coal will be lower YoY
   * This was expected as they shutdown a coal mine for 5 months. They also are expecting Union protests at a coal terminal (not something they own). 
* Copper is inline with expectations 
* Zinc is above expectations
* Bitumen is too new to establish a trend/expectations, but overall seems low

Let's now compare TECK's commodity expectations against current future prices: 

* Steelmaking coal: 
   * Expected Cost of Sales: $67/ton - due to reduced mining output and sales and declining to $60/ton by December. Additionally, transportation is about $40/ton for your railcar. 
      * Expect transportation costs to be on the higher end or higher. Everyone is shipping right now, and rail/freight is super expensive. 
   * Met coal is very hard to find real-time prices on, but typically is about $150/ton (fell to $100/ton in Q1-2). If you have a Bloomberg Terminal, please share real-time prices with us plebeians. 
      * Currently I expect met coal to be trading about $140/ton. Coal prices are [rapidly rising](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/coal) after all time lows from Covid. 
   * [News](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/23/2131382/0/en/Teck-Provides-Steelmaking-Coal-Market-Update.html) on China/Teck coal relations - Teck maintains Q4 coal volume of 5.8-6.2m/tons, but will ship 20% to China due to increased demand 
      * Read the article - China is willing to pay Teck $30-35/ton over Australian spot. Recent shipments in November were $160-165/ton, which is a huge premium, and likely only increased in recent weeks. They've also sold 7.5m tons (25% annual production) at $50 over Australian spot for 2021. China is eating steel, and Teck is feeding the fire. 
   * Coal production expectations were higher for Q4 due to better ore grade, but TECK didn't provide numbers for increased expectations. We might see higher than 6.2m tons on rising prices. 
   * Coal was clubbed like a baby seal in Q1-2 because most steel plants world-wide were shutdown. If you read this thread, you know that Steel is reaching record high prices due to limited supply from these plant shutdowns. It would be prudent of you to invest in met coal, which is used in blast furnaces in steel production. Prices are rapidly rising and coal companies are wildly undervalued. 
      * Check out Arch Resources for a large US coal company play. 
   * TECK noted in Q3 report that coal orders were below COVID levels, but with current prices and confirmation on trading prices, we should see increased revs on coal for Q4. 
      * TECK noted that companies were not selling coal as it would be at a huge loss, so there was significant quantity in queue at port. However, they also noted that Australia didn't have any in port, so it should be non-Australiana coal miner taking advantage of recent coal price increases. 
      * They also note that there's significant inventory of coking coal in China, so we shouldn't expect this to be a big driver for earnings.
      * FWIW - China is mostly buying coal from Mongolia at prices $100 over spot. Go look on twitter for proof. 
      * TECK also acknowledges that they can meet increased demand from China if needed for Coal. However, they've closed mines over the past year, which decreases their ability to scale. 
* Copper: 
   * Expected cost of sales - $1.55/pound on the high end. Trading at $3.5+/pound is a huge margin. Look for increases in copper to make this soar. 
   * Copper prices were $3.02/pound on Oct 26 and are at $3.61/pound today. That's a 19% increase in pricing for you mathematicians. 
   * QB2 is going to be a huge copper mine that comes operational in 2022. Copper prices continuing to increase is super bullish for TECK to take advantage of higher copper prices. 
      * Most of TECK's losses are going into capital expenditures for a huge copper mine opening in 2022. Copper demand will increase 100% by 2030 per BHP (world's largest copper producer), so this is super bullish. Buy into mines opening soon. 
      * TECK trades almost 50% of copper to China. This isn't an anomaly. 
* Zinc: 
   * Zinc is bearish for TECK - their mine has decreasing volume YoY each quarter. It's a dying mine, but still super profitable. 
   * Zinc is about $.60/pound for cost for sales. 
   * Zinc shipments to China rose by 40%. China zinc production decreased, which led them to reach out to TECK. 
   * Zinc is trading at 21% increase compared to prices at earnings. 
   * Zinc is more complicated as there is different prices depending on the grade. 
   * Mining volume should increase in Q4 to match 2019 output. Mining output in Q4 2019 was about double. 

**Outlook**: 

Commodities are entering a multi-year bull market, and TECK is a great investment. As a trader though, you are looking for a short-term profit rather than a long term hold. Here's a few things to help: 

* Copper should consolidate before moving towards $4/pound. That pullback is your opportunity to buy the dip. 
* Canadian Banks primarily cover $TECK and have Price Estimates between $23-27. My personal price target with copper holding $3.6/pound is $30 by March. TECK is low market cap ($10b right now). It booms and busts with commodity changes. $TECK at usual 2010-2020 prices would be about $12b rev/annually, but that'll change with current prices. 
* TECK acknowledges there is consolidation in the sector. How cool is that? 
* Q3 call focused on coal and water treatment. It didn't focus on Copper and Zinc, which are skyrocketing. Analysts were wanting to assess TECK's weaknesses, and confirmed that there's a huge buying opportunity here. 
* Bitumen (asphalt) was a loss on $TECK's books in Q3. Bitumen is up 12% on the month, but it is a new commodity and hard to evaluate. 
* Disclaimer: Miners estimate their ore output. When they announce earnings, it will change. 
* TECK will have about $500m in capital expenditures in Q4. That's bullish for long term, but maybe hurtful in short term. 
* Covid has minimal impact and is easy tax write-off. 
* TECK has plenty of debt revolvers to finance mines. 
* Copper will go to $4 with expectations of EVs and Clean energy &lt;3

**Napkin Math**: 

* $TECK revs are expected at $2.8b CAD. We should well exceed that. 
   * 6m tons of coal @ $150 = $900m - this is a super bullish number. If at $130, then we get $780m. 
      * Cost is $100/ton. That's $30-50/ton of profit. or $180-300m in profit. 
   * Let's expect a $2/pound profit on copper. That's a $600m profit on copper. 
   * Let's expect $1.20/pound profit on Zinc. That's $565m profit on zinc, with considerable upside if volume increases

**Plays**:

Title: #LKNCY is dare I say alive...
Chairman Lu is out who orchestrated the fraud, his family, friends are out. Shares were confiscated. Sean Shao educated here in the states who blew whistle is new chairman.

Please see quotes from the JPL link below. [JPL report for cayman court](https://investor.luckincoffee.com/static-files/177f69c0-b876-407e-ae2f-40f032af1ebd)

They've been completely open and cooperative with the SEC and Cayman court systems and have righted the ship. The 180 million penalty, they can deduct future law suits from.

"

1. The Company has come to an agreement with the SEC, which is embodied in the consent and the draft final judgment dated 16 December 2020 (see Appendix III). Under the terms of the agreement, the Company, without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, consented to the entry of an order requiring the Company to pay a civil penalty in the amount of US$180M. The civil penalty is to be offset by the dollar value of any cash payments made by the Company to CBs and SHs pursuant to schemes of arrangement sanctioned by the Cayman Court, if such payments are made within 42 months subject to extensions granted by the SEC staff and provided the final distribution plan is not reasonably objectionable to SEC staff."

The court audit showed 750 million approx in cash. They are reportedly churning a profit now per those court filings and sitting a less than a billion market cap.

"

1. As previously mentioned, the Company implemented various improvement measures to refine and optimise its store portfolio and pricing and as a result of these efforts, the Company achieved positive store level profit1 at the aggregate level for the first time in August 2020. Additionally, more than 60% of the approximately 3,898 self-operated stores were profitable on store level1 in November 2020."
2. .2 Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were RMB 5,175.0 million (US$742.7 million) as of 30 November 2020.

They have stated they will file earnings and in my humble opinion they will probably attempt to relist. Even if they don't look at Tencent market cap.

Palantir's demo day confirmed for late January. Demonstrating Apollo, Foundry, and Gotham to billions around the globe - can you imagine the new orders and additional positive media boost for PLTR? Everyone will ACTUALLY be able to see PLTR's insane SKYNET tech in action - be prepared for Karp, Thiel, and PLTR to kick off with a BANG.

By going with a direct listing, PLTR didn't get the roadshow/marketing experience through the investment banks. This is their big splash. Do you think Thiel and Karp and are gonna get up there and lay an egg on their first big event? No, they are gonna kill it, and the stock price will MOON.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: PLTR gets tons of new orders and GLOBAL media exposure  - $80 by END OF JANUARY, setting up for $100+ by next earnings.

Title: Upstart ($UPST) - AI Lending, IPOd 12/16
**Introduction**

AI is upending existing industries
and creating new ones. Whether self-driving cars, home assistants, or language translation, software that learns and improves on its own has moved from research labs to the mainstream in just a few years.

Upstart is one of the first businesses to apply AI to the multi-trillion dollar credit industry. Upstart goes beyond the FICO score, using non-conventional variables at scale to provide superior loan performance and improve consumers' access to credit.

**Why Buy?**

Upstart's model is significantly more accurate than traditional lending models; allowing them to approve more applicants at lower loss rates.

They have 75% fewer defaults at the same approval rate as boomer lenders. Additionally, they have 173% **more approvals at the same loss rate**. And guess what? They approve loans almost instantaneously (69% of the loans in Q4 2019), which means no need for underwriters needing to approve every loan.

Oh yeah and I forgot to mention that theyre founder was the president of enterprise at Google, maybe youve heard of it.

Market Cap is a little over 2bn but itll be 5.5 in no time.

Title: $NRZ increases dividend 33%
I've been following NRZ for years and always benefited from their huge dividends. Pre covid they were giving out $0.50 dividends on a stock that cost under 20 bucks. Right when covid hit they dropped their divided from 50 cents to 5 cents! Ridiculous right? Well as you could guess, the share price plummeted. This was totally out of character for them and their earnings weren't even that effected by covid. This is a real estate and financial services company. My neighbor is a residential loan officer and his company was just bought out by NRZ! They took an opportunity to retain some profit and expand their business, all while crying covid. Those fuckers... But what to do when you hear all this? I of course kept buying more shares. I'm sitting on almost a thousand atm. They have steadily increased their dividend each quarter from .05 to .10 to .15 and now to .20 announced dec 16th. Stock prices have historically risen proportionally and we're probably two or three quarters away from ath and as long as dividends rise each quarter. This is a slow play but you can benefit from high yields and rising prices. No brainier for an artist like myself hedging some riskier bets.

Title: Silver Miners Guide
A while ago I promised some of you to write up on silver miners. A lot of things happened since then, including me getting stuck in the hospital for 2 months, but a promise is a promise. Besides, I figured WSB only pays attention to the stocks, which already moved up significantly in the past few days, before falling off the cliff once we, retards, load up on calls. And as youve probably seen, silver has moved up \~8% in a few days (miners  15% and more). So here we go.

This post is designed to give a start to those of you, who know nothing about this field and just want to dip their toes. In no way, shape or form I poses professional knowledge or formal education on mining, this is purely what Ive learned speculating stocks.

Here you can find my basic write-ups on:

[\- precious metals ETFs](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i4qq4u/the_autistic_guide_to_precious_metals_etfs/)

[\- gold miners](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqzije/gold_mines_w_positions_and_plays/)

[\- jewelry public companies](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ikqo3m/jewelry_a_bear_playing_a_bull_disguised_as_a_bear/)

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Why invest in silver miners?**

Ill give you 5 reasons:

1. Silver is a stronger (but riskier) hedge against monetary inflation: if you are right about inflation gold will move, but silver will move more;
2. Silver has much more industrial usage than gold;
3. Jewelers have bigger demand for silver than gold;
4. Silver to gold price ratio is historically low right now and all commodities are undepriced compared to equity futures like S&amp;P.
5. Silver is future-proof, unlike gold: it is heavily used in solar panels and electronics. Also, 2019 industrial and jewelry demand of silver is very suppressed: only jewelry silver demand is estimated to lose 23% in 2020.

In fact, lets talk about demand:

As of 2018, total demand was 32 146 tons of physical silver:

https://preview.redd.it/ce1b3cfs2t561.png?width=715&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=623d38466713f2d66beaa7ed251225dc00556930

Industrial use: 17997 tons (\~ 56%);

Jewelry: 6611 tons (\~ 21%);

Coins and bars: 5637 tons (\~ 18%);

Silverware: 1900 tons (\~ 6%).

Among industrial demand electronics contributes 7730 tons, while solar was already 2503 tons in 2018. This will only increase. Yep, youve probably thought that majority of silver is used on silver spoons that your grandma used to pick up in Target, while cool futuristic kids use lithium in Teslas. Turns out, solar panels already use more silver than all of the silverware combined.

Theres also another reason to play silver miners right now: it was harder hit by Covid lockdowns. Why so? Because majority of silver production is done in Latin America (in fact, out of 6 biggest producing countries  4 are in Latin America) and Latin countries on average had much tougher lockdowns, compared to leading gold producers like Australia, China, Russia, etc.

**2. How silver is mined?**

Unlike some other metals, silver is never found on itself. It is always mined in ores that contain either of three large groups of metals: gold, copper, zinc and lead. Ore is then processed and refined to get the end product. Why is this important? Because when you build a model trying to forecast earnings of the company you can not focus on silver prices alone, you have to take every byproduct into consideration.

**3. How to determine which mine is a good buy?**

**3.1. Lets start by understanding metrics.** Your regular EBITDA, EPS or even FCF wont tell you much about where the miner is going, because

a) they do not determine the price of their product;b) they have no direct control over the longevity of the product source.

Thats why gold miners came out with their unique metrics by which they evaluate each individual mine and then calculate producers average. Those metrics are Cash Cost and All-in Sustaining Costs. Those are non-GAAP metrics and Im not even sure if they are audited.

Cash costs include mine site operating costs such as mining, processing, administration, production taxes and royalties which are not based on sales or taxable income calculations, but are exclusive of amortization, reclamation, capital, development and exploration costs. AISC is, basically, a wider metric introduced later by World Gold Council. It includes every cost of running a mine excluding: Income tax. Working capital (except for adjustments to inventory on a sales basis). All financing charges (including capitalized interest). Costs related to business combinations, asset acquisitions and asset disposals. Items needed to normalize earnings, for example impairments on non-current assets and one-time material severance charges.

If you want to learn more about quirks and features of those metrics I urge you to read this paper: [https://digitalcommons.mtech.edu/mine\_engr/9/](https://digitalcommons.mtech.edu/mine_engr/9/)

So take metal futures prices average during quarter, subtract AISC and here goes your mine profit before taxes and royalty payments.

**3.2. Silver miners now also use mostly AISC**. And calculating silver production they use Ag Eq metrics, which is average ratio of silver to all other byproducts over the quarter. And when they present profits, they also use Ag Eq sold, which again include silver and all byproducts.

I would argue, that Ag Eq metrics are also misleading for silver miners. Because when a gold miners produce gold all other byproducts are not that numerous and, whats more important, far, far cheaper, thus their impact is negligible. Silver is a different story. For example, let's take Caylloma mine, 2019. They produced 45.6kk lb of Zinc, 28.7kk lb of Lead and 0.9 kk oz of silver. In today prices this would be 58kk USD / 27kk USD and 23.4kk USD. As you can see, in fact silver's output for this mine is the smallest. I've even came across arguments, that silver should never be considered a main product, only a byproduct.

The problem for you is that you might be watching only silver prices, which, say increase 25% and wonder, why your miner isnt doing so great, while ignoring that zinc and lead prices dropped and it had a bigger impact on your miner, than rising silver.

What you could use instead is a total cost of tonnes milled. Most miners publish this metric. And then model every metal received separately. In fact, most analysts try to model grades of mines, which is basically amount of useful stuff among all shit excavated. But were getting really too deep now.

**3.3. Another extremely important thing to remember is a life of a mine.** See, it can be very different: some mines can live 20 years, some are ending their life cycle. You open prospects of a miner and you search for the guidance on the next year and you see how much metals they plan to produce. Then you check expected life of their assets. If an asset is nearing its end, grades usually get lower, which means less profits. Also, investors put a pressure on a miner to replace dying asset, and if nothing is found in time  stock price tends to trade lower than what its cash flows might suggest.

There are also surprise scenarios like extending the life expectancy of a mine, or finding new deposits. But thats a gamble.

Once a mine is done, it becomes a liability, instead of an asset, because it is put on care and maintenance, which is expensive and lasts years and years. Thats why I prefer junior miners with only few assets: they usually do not baghold liabilities from long-gone projects. And also its easier to model them.

**3.4. Finally, pay attention to jurisdictions**: how stable the local governments are, how corrupt or how focused on ESG standards. Unfortunately, mining is a risky business with bad rep (sometime deserved, sometimes not). Thats why a populist government can always blame miners on some environmental or social damage and close them down or nationalize the mine.

**Bonus.** Lets look into my biggest silver position as of today: Fortuna Silver Mine (**FSM**).

Reasoning:

1. Relatively stable jurisdictions of Mexico, Peru and Argentina;
2. Heavy Covid lockdowns, so I could pick it up rather cheap;
3. Peru and Mexico mines have at least 5 years of life;
4. They have gold mine under construction in Argentina. It is expected to have 15 years of life and to produce 150k oz of gold per year at AISC 800 USD/oz. This is not yet properly priced in, because FSM is trading following mainly silver and silver miners ETFs. This is also in part because the project has been delayed several times. But theyve already mined first 15k oz this year, so I have little doubt that they will achieve meaningful production next year.
5. Relatively low cost of production;
6. CEO is third generation miner and Peru national;
7. They have increased their debt to finance Argentina project, but the net debt is not that big compared to Free Cash Flow;
8. Sprott fund is heavily into this stock and so is Adrian Day (he has his own fund and also manages Peter Schiffs funds while Peter sticks to ranting about the Fed on his radio).

I have a price target of 8.66 for FSM, with a rather conservative metal prices estimate.

**Lets sum it all up.**

**Why invest in a silver miner?**

Because silver moves more than gold, because it has much more industrial and practical use and it has future upside.

**How do you find good silver miners?**

You pick stable jurisdictions, you look into byproducts and estimate if those also fit your outlook and price expectancy and, finally, you check the life expectancy of the mines. Of course, do not forget to look into the books and check the debt ratios.

To be fair, Ill also list considerations **why NOT to invest in a silver miner**:

1. company has almost no control over the price of the product;
2. high political and social risks;
3. uncertainty of the companys future once its mines reach their end: there no guarantee that the management will be able to find an asset of an equal quality, thus rarely miners are buy and hold forever;
4. no goodwill, brand value or any kind of a moat;
5. mining industry has a bad rep and is often operating in remote areas, thus its very limited in its access to good labour;
6. basically, no meaningful dividend.

Hope this helps someone to make an educated decision or to carry a deeper research. If any of you have questions or would like to discuss commodities  Ill be glad. Also, I might do a write up on commodities that will be used in future green tech (EVs, solar, etc), since theres so much more than just lithium. But well see, aint promising anything this time ;)

Title: KTPI - Vaccine SZN
\*\*KPTI... im fucking retarded

**DISCLAIMER: This is my personal opinion and not professional investment advice.**

Okay retards I've been watching this stock for a few months and I got a banger for us to make some tendies on. So hear me out, it's a clinically proven fact that vaccines are the leading cause of retardation. Just think about it, have you ever gotten a vaccine before (the answer is probably yes)? Now ask yourself, where are you currently? Are you at home, at work, on the porcelain throne? NOPE, you are in the retard capital of the world, r/wallstreetbets. After being a longtime lurker in this subreddit there is one thing that's clear to me, the **RETARDS** make money, and the **CHADS** blow up their accounts. So that is where the basis for this option play comes from.

Vaccine HYPE = Retarded GAINS.

## Karyopharm Therapeutics - Who Are They?

Karyopharm Therapeutics is a commercial stage pharmaceutical company pioneering novel cancer therapies. Their leading therapeutic drug, Xpovio (Selinexor), is a selective inhibitor of nuclear exports. It works by binding to the exportin 1 (XPO1), also known as the chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM1), which is a eukaryotic protein that mediates the nuclear export of various proteins and RNAs. So in layman's terms this drug works by blocking the transport of cancerous proteins involved in cancer-cell growth. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication and is approved for the use in patients with a type of cancer called multiple myeloma [\[1\]](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/22/2051422/0/en/Karyopharm-Announces-FDA-Approval-of-XPOVIO-selinexor-for-the-Treatment-of-Patients-with-Relapsed-or-Refractory-Diffuse-Large-B-cell-Lymphoma-DLBCL.html).

# Karyopharm Therapeutics - Why Should I Care?

Coronavirus (COVID-19) is caused by the single stranded RNA virus (SARS-CoV2). A protein called exportin 1 (XPO1) has been shown to be important in both the virus lifecycle and the inflammation caused by the virus. The inhibition of XPO1 by taking Selinexor leads to both anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties. So while this drug may not be a vaccine per-se, it has the efficacy of being used for patients with COVID-19 to help relieve symptoms and drastically reduce the chance of the being put on a ventilator due to its anti-inflammatory effects on the lungs alveoli (tiny air sacs that fill with oxygen when you inhale). This is what makes this company so valuable, the fact that they aren't dependent on a hit or miss vaccine, they have a reliable treatment to COVID-19, which is a leading cure for cancer. Karyopharm gets all the hype around vaccines, while maintaining very little of the expectations of putting out a working product (they already have one).

# Pre-Vaccine Outlook

https://preview.redd.it/8nq8kzv9hs561.png?width=1478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ec33611dadf41926ab4192323e52026e98f876c

This was my pre-vaccine outlook on this stock. I was hoping it was getting ready to skyrocket, unfortunately it kept its steady decline downwards, hitting resistance in the $14-$15 range. Thank god I was a CHAD at the time and didn't end up investing. However, one thing happened on November 9th that set the events for this stock to skyrocket - VACCINE SZN! So now I'm back and more retarded than ever and willing to bet big on this one.

# Post-Vaccine Outlook

https://preview.redd.it/mh1d2r4bhs561.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b6abd2d961e6bc3a67ff11f7293927e8d6ac80c

I have put together some of the most discussed stocks Vaccine Stocks in the last month that I felt were somewhat connected to Karyopharm in that their vaccines/treatments focus on an RNA inhibitor either preventing the spread of the virus or drastically reduce the chance of you getting it all together (basically tricking the body into thinking you already had it). Group 1 Stocks have already popped from their November 9th price point, however, Group 2 Stocks have been lagging behind. **Pfizer (PFE)** being the first big name company to announce and commercialize a vaccine already had this priced into their stock price. Analysts predicted that this vaccine would increase Pfizer's earnings by 10% next year with an expected sale of 1.3 billion doses of their Covid vaccine. **Karyopharm (KPTI)** is in a unique position as it has been vastly overshadowed by the big name companies debuting a vaccine and awaiting FDA approval, while Karyopharm already has an effective treatment that is multifaceted in its use. Once Covid 19 is gone, the treatment can still be heavily commercialized for cancer treatments.

 We all know technicals are bullshit, so ill keep this short. Looking at the technicals I think we are set up to ramp up over the next month back to the \~$17.5 - $20 range. I have purchased both $17.5 1/15 Calls and $20 2/19 Calls. About $10,000 worth combined. 

**TLDR:**

Just buy this shit. Xpovio (Selinexor) link in helping treat COVID-19 and potential vaccine trials brought this company a lot of exposure in Wall Street as well as mainstream media which should bring it short/mid term gains from those trying to profit off this vaccine hype that's driving the market currently.

Buy 1-2 month out OTM calls.

Title: SKLZ to the moon
What more DD do you autists need, Look at this ticker. SKLZ. Get your shit together, your wifes boyfriend will be jealous when your bringing in all the tendies. Internet stonks only go up.

Some bullet points I found on the internets:

Skillz began trading on the NYSE today under the ticker SKLZ.

The SPAC transaction included $849 million in funding from investors like Wellington and Fidelity.

Now that it is trading, Skillz has $250 million in cash.

Additionally, investors will appreciate that it has no debt on its balance sheet.

Importantly, Skillz is now the first publicly traded mobile esports platform.

This public debut sets a record and also comes at a time when esports are increasingly popular.

Company executives think the Skillz SPAC merger is the perfect way to leverage the growth runway in the industry and to expand internationally.

With this in mind, Skillz estimates that there are 2.7 billion gamers in the entire world.

Those 2.7 billion gamers are in a market that will be worth $150 billion by 2025.

Right now, the international market makes up less than 10% of company revenue.

However, Skillz said it has plans to really lean into international expansion.

It believes its own revenue will grow from $225 million in 2020 to $555 million in 2022.

What do these companies all have in common? Peter Thiel as a founding investor. 

I'm sick of seeing all you dumbasses speculating on how hard it is to find the next TSLA in one thread and complaining about 'bag-holding' PLTR in another.

You retards have unwittingly bought into what the CEO has described will be the 'most important software in the world in a couple years' but are too ADD to sit on a stock for longer than a week.  The fucking DoD gave this company **[800 million dollars](https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/27/palantir-army-contract-dcgs-a/)** over a year ago and they've publicly stated they will never work with China (who by the way the US is about to engage in a tech / data arms race with if they aren't already). 

Gov't contracts aside, public companies are spending 10s of millions of dollars on this software and it's *saving them even more*.  They have essentially been in stealth mode developing their tech for the last 17 years to assure that they have no competition, and the revenue is about to pour in big time. 

Nobody understands this stock yet, and that's beautiful because it has potential to grow 10x in the next 5 years.

Those bags you're complaining about holding are filled with diamonds, institutional investors realized this too late and have been trying to fuck with the price in response.

Theyre American

WeBull? Chinese Owned

EToro? Israel Owned

Robinhood has been killing boomer brokers since its inception and i can guarantee you that the bigger brokers are salivating into either buying out robinhood or buying shares in the company

Mellenials, Gen Z and Gen X are all hopping on Robinhood and completely forgetting about Schwab, etrade fucking who knows what else is out there

in 10 years or so the majority of new users are going to be on Robinhood as well as a LOT of new money

The more the years come the less money the older brokers will have and the more money and people with start using Robinhood

Plus Robinhood is literally the sponsor of this Sub

and this Sub is the most fucking Autistic American thing ive ever seen in my life

Title: DD: Why you should be playing VALE instead of MT (if you had to choose one)
I am seeing way too many people supposedly going all in on MT. Here I will cover my reasons for choosing VALE over MT as my main steel play. Disclaimer: I'm a dumb idiot just like the rest of you, this is not financial advice, and also diversification is always a viable choice. If you want to play both, in addition to CLF or whatever, all the power to you. I personally hold all of these to some degree though mostly in VALE. This post is directed to people who want to slam dunk every dollar into one ticker.

**---VALE has far lower IV than MT. This mean MUCH cheaper options.**

I'm putting this first. I know that IV is a vague, mysterious concept to most of you. In simple terms, IV dictates how expensive options are. VALE calls are ridiculously cheap compared to MT because of its lower IV. Here's an example, using current call prices with June 2021 strike date since this is a popular date.

VALE June 2021 20c (15% OTM): 1.04

MT June 2021 28c (18% OTM): 2.37

These prices are ridiculous. For the price of that one MT call, which has a delta of 0.4, you could buy 2.27 VALE calls, which give a combined delta of .87!

Again to simplify this, your potential profit per dollar invested is more than twice as high with VALE calls! Yes the underlying stock price is a little different, but not nearly enough to compensate for this difference. Unless you think MT will outperform VALE significantly, which for the reasons below is unlikely anyway, you should absolutely be in VALE instead of MT.

**---One major reason for the current steel price spike is high iron ore prices**

https://www.mining.com/iron-ore-prices-on-the-march-again/

&gt;Last week the steelmaking raw material hit $160, the highest since February 2013 and up 70% year to date. 

**---VALE is a major steelmaker and at the same time the world's second biggest iron ore producer**

https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/features/top-five-iron-ore-producing-companies-world/

Smell that? That's the smell of VERTICAL INTEGRATION and benefiting at every step of the supply chain. Should note that VALE is usually the biggest iron ore producer, but production has recently fallen due to several factors.

**---MT in comparison only mines 1/6th as much iron ore as VALE**

https://www.mining-technology.com/features/top-ten-metals-and-mining-companies-in-2020/

&gt;ArcelorMittal operates 13 mines, which produced 57.1Mt of iron ore during the year accounting for 52% of the companys iron ore requirements.

This means MT needs to pay out the ass for the remaining 48% of their iron ore requirements. That means less tendies.

**---VALE also has hidden major potential upsides in its nickel production**

Remember the battery day DDs? They are still relevant. VALE is the world's biggest nickel producer. That's not going away.

https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/features/top-nickel-producing-companies/

Oh and nickel prices are spiking as well.

https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/nickel-price

Title: $NPA - Satellite internet backed by Vodafone &amp; Rakuten, only phone required
Dear retards, TLDR below. Note: I censored it a little with commas.

...

Special purpose acquisition company New Providence will take next-generation satellite broadband specialist AST &amp; Science public through a S,PAC deal that gives the space company an equity value of $1.8 billion, the firm announced Wednesday.

AST will list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ASTS when the deal closes, which is expected in the first quarter of next year. New Providences S,PAC is currently listed under the symbol NPA.

Midland, Texas-based AST is building a network of satellites it calls SpaceMobile, designed to deliver broadband from space directly to consumer smartphones. Existing satellite networks require additional physical devices to connect to the service, such as Iridiums mobile satellite phones or SpaceXs Starlink user terminals.

What were doing is launching a space-based satellite network that allows any phone  without any modification of hardware, software, apps, nothing  to be able to connect directly to satellites, AST chairman and C,EO Abel Avellan told CNBC.

This will support true 5G broadband speed.

...

Avellan said AST is still in the development phase building its SpaceMobile network, also known in the space industry as a constellation of satellites. The company launched an experimental satellite named BlueWalker 1 in April 2019. The satellite successfully reached orbit and served as a technology test bed.

The company plans to launch BlueWalker 3, its second test satellite, in late 2021. That satellite will cost about $48 million, according to ASTs investor presentation last month. Avellan noted that, like BlueWalker 1, BlueWalker 3 will also not be for end-user services.

We get to revenue when we launch our first 20 [satellites] in the second half of 2022 for commercial operation in 2023, Avellan said.

...

ASTs investor presentation named Elon Musks SpaceX, European ArianeGroup, Jeff Bezos Blue Origin, Russian GK Launch and Indian PSLV as potential launch providers.

AST also announced Wednesday existing investor Vodafone Group as a SpaceMobile launch partner, with the British telecommunications giant planning to be involved when ASTs service begins in 2023. Vodafone invested in AST in March, alongside Japanese conglomerate Rakuten.

We believe SpaceMobile is uniquely placed to provide universal mobile coverage, further enhancing our leading network across Europe and Africa  especially in rural areas and during a natural or humanitarian disaster  for customers on their existing smartphones, Vodafone Group C,EO Nick Read said in a statement in March.

Through the Vodafone partnership and pending regulatory approval in each country, AST expects to offer commercial service in 49 equatorial nations. The companys SpaceMobile network will reach over 700 million unconnected people, according to ASTs investor presentation.

...

ASTs board of directors notably includes its telecom partners. With Avellan as the chairman, the AST board includes Rakuten chairman and C,EO Mickey Mikitani, Vodafone head of research and development Luke Ibbetson, Cisneros Group C,EO Adriana Cisneros and Rakuten Mobile executive vice president and C,TO Tareq Amin, with American Tower C,TO Ed Knapp as a board observer and AST C,OO and C,FO Tom Severson as a director.

TLDR. Satellite internet without any additional devices, unlike Elon Musks Starlink or Iridium, just your phone. Deal is Q1 2021. Musk and Bezos are potential partners. Investors like Vodafone and Rakuten. Board includes Rakuten chairman Mikitani, Vodafone Head of R,&amp;D, C,TO and EVP, Cisneros C,EO, and American Tower C,TO. I got big fucking tendonitis reading this you mofos.

Title: $CLF to infinite and beyond!
$CLF is a fantastic play to get into before years end and please do not overlook this opportunity. They have acquired all of $MT USA and AK steel, making them the largest US and North American steel powerhouse. No longer considered a sole mining company, but a fully integrated steel company. 

What does this mean? To the fucking moon. 

$CLF is heavy in the automotive and EV sector, marine, aircraft, etc. Too boot connections now with mr. Musk down in Texas. This coupled with the new presidency infrastructure to be put into play will net you some sweet tendies.

Title: Skillz (SKLZ) Becomes First Publicly-Traded Mobile Esports Platform Following Merger 12/17
[Skillz](https://variety.com/t/skillz/) Inc. has become the first publicly traded mobile esports platform following completion of its merger with Flying Eagle Acquisition Corp., the public acquisition vehicle headed by Hollywood industry veterans [Harry Sloan](https://variety.com/t/harry-sloan/) and [Jeff Sagansky](https://variety.com/t/jeff-sagansky/).

Skillz Inc. and its common stock will begin trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol SKLZ..

The company announced Wednesday it has $250 million in cash and no debt on the balance sheet at a time when themobile gaming market is expected to more than double by 2025 to $150 billion.

We built Skillz on the founding belief that esports are for everyone, and have made significant progress toward our vision of enabling everyone to share in the future of competition, said Andrew Paradise, CEO and founder of Skillz. We stand at the intersection of mobile gaming and esports, perhaps the two most exciting growth opportunities of the next decade. I thank the entire Skillz team for their dedication, passion, and creativity, which have led us to this incredible moment on our journey to build the competition layer of the internet.

Skillz asserted that it has pioneered the future of the gaming industry, enabling developers to monetize their content five times better than ads or in-app purchases by enabling developers to expand the reach of their games and scale their businesses.

Ive had a front row seat to the video game and entertainment industrys evolution over the past two decades, from my role as founding investor and board member of Bethesda Games to recently taking [DraftKings](https://variety.com/t/draftkings/) public, said Sloan, chairman of Flying Eagle. We believe that Andrew has positioned Skillz to lead the convergence of mobile, gaming, and player enablement into the future of entertainment itself.

The transaction includes the $158.5 million investment led by Wellington Management Company, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, LLC, Franklin Templeton, and Neuberger Berman. Paradise and Chief Research Officer Casey Chafkin will continue to lead the company.

Title: BNTX and MRNA Long Hold
Alright guys I'm gonna be honest: I started investing because of the memes. I'm a poor student and I live in a socially supportive state (Switzerland) so my tuition and living cost is pretty much provided by the state so I don't have to worry about this. This also means that I don't really care that much about money which made it more easy for me to just YOLO my personal savings (which was only 1.5k so probably I don't even belong here but what ever).  


Now as the retard I am I started of no knowing what I'm doing but gradually moved into thinking long term. Now if you're not interested in such boomer-like thinking I don't judge you. Call me a gay boomer in the comments and scroll along.  


Alright. As stated I don't know much about the stock market itself BUT I can say that I have a pretty sound understanding of the significance of future treatment opportunities (med student, 4th year). Big things are happening in the treatment of all kinds of diseases that until today were not really well treatable. Now a new focus especially is the integration of the Immune system into a medical treatment. The past few years medicine was all about supporting the human body or fixing the human body with the mindset that it can't fix itself. Now immune therapy is on a big rise. Why did this take so long you might ask? Technology. Effective methods are just now beginning to come up and that shit looks promising as fuck. I could go into the details but this is already a huge text so I just make it short: The immune system has been part of us for thousands of years. Surely it will always be vulnerable to NEW infections BUT since new infections were a thing before all along means what developed over all the years was the effectiveness of ADAPTING to a new threat. It truly is astonishing how insanely effective our immune system can create an effective HIGHLY specific response to a new threat. And as I talked about this before, using this very effective system as a way of confronting a disease has not been used at all except for vaccination of course. Because we didn't have a way to to it. Now what BNTX and MRNA are pushing with their vaccine is a technology that is thought of since 1990. So the idea of an mRNA vaccine (earlier even DNA vaccine) already exists quite a while but this technology had the struggles of the mRNA being destroyed in our body before it could fulfill it's purpose. They had to find new ways to modify the mRNA so it could survive long enough to fulfill it's purpose. THAT was the problem. Now this year they really seemed to be able to make it effective enough. And the cool thing is that RNA bears no threat to being implemented into our genome since our body simply LACKS the necessary enzymes to do that. This technology means SO much more than just a one-time-vaccine. It's the fact that this technology is now ABLE to do what it was supposed to do all along. For pretty much the first time. This opens up treatment options for all diseases where a protein-antigen based immune response against a disease would be of help. And these my dear retards are a LOT of diseases. What this means is that they could simply identify mRNA which corresponds with the target protein that they want the immune system to be sensitized against and vaccinate you with it. Boom. That's insane.  


Now I also looked into the studies of the BioNTech vaccine and had a look at the side effects. All the side effects are simply signs of an immune reaction taking place (headache, muscle pain, chills) and were rarely stronger than "moderate". The thing that struck out to me also was that more people in the placebo group died (4 out of 21,828) than did in the treatment group (2 out of 21,823) which means it's very safe also.  


So idk about you guys but I take a little muscle pain for one or two days to be immune against HIV any day of the week and I think so will many more people. That's why I'm very optimistic and planing on holding my CFD positions for years to come.

EDIT: 

Title: Why I am bullish on INTC
Intel is looked at like our retarded cousin that doesn't know how to put a circle into the circle hole and decides mashing the triangle into it different ways should work. However, I think it is misleading to think of intel as retarded and more of a sleeping giant. Sure they have fucked up real hard with their 10nm and 7nm processes. Thats not the point tho... 

In the midst of all of the EV and autonomous EV hype. Intel has a roadmap THAT THEY WILL HIT with their company MobileEye to have a FULLY autonomous car by 2021.

How many of you retards even knew Intel had an autonomous vehicle division??

Title: Rackspace Technology - IPO ALERT GET IN NOW
**Rackspace Technology Inc. (**RXT) Taken Public by Apollo - recent IPO (26% shorted)

My positions: 

$25c 1/15/21 for  0.43

$30c 1/15/21 for 0.18

$35c 1/21/2022 for 2.00

AMZN has invested in Rackspace. say less. potential for acquisition, high. Recent acquisition of Amar Maletira as President and Chief Financial Officer (**strategic M&amp;A experience**). Many companies would like to own and compete against AMZN in Server infrastructure. Rackspace **designs, builds and operates customers cloud environments across all major technology platforms**, irrespective of technology stack or deployment model. **MACD** \- all signs point to a slight dip in RXT during the remaining weeks in December, followed by a significant buying opportunity. Analyzing the below suggests:   

[A few services Rackspace excels in: breach detection and penetration testing which is critical for cloud computing enterprises.   ](https://preview.redd.it/h2vxgesh2r561.png?width=559&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73ee0923ed85ac1b711617f87178306f7b6c679d)

Title: From the guy who posted about Chargepoint at $12 - The company that builds zero-emission trucks for DHL and Amazon
I posted about Chargepoint when it was trading at $12, and I hope some of you followed my trade: [Proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iyu629/sbe_could_be_the_next_spi_biggest_ev_charging/)

And here comes my next play, as some of you know Plug is up 800% YTD which means there is a lot of downside to invest in it right now. But there is an even better play, Plug power partnered with another company to build commercial trucks which you can read [here](https://www.ir.plugpower.com/Press-Releases/Press-Release-Details/2020/Plug-Power-Partners-with-Lightning-Systems-to-Build-Zero-Emission-Middle-Mile-Delivery-Solution/default.aspx).

This company recently announced it wants to become publicly traded and announced a reverse merger with a company which trades only slightly above $11.

You basically get the potential of Plug and all the EV hype along with a downside of just 10% as you can redeem your shares for $10.xx. For me that is a no-brainer and I am holding 5,000 shares myself.

Summary:

\- Ticker: **G\*I\*K**

\- EV company that partnered with Plug to build EV trucks

\- Low downside of just 10%

\- Amazon, DHL, Keurig are already customers

Title: Momentus IPO (Space): Biggest winner of early 2021
Hello fellow retards. I posted DD about Gravity amount a month ago, and the stock is up like 50%.

My next play is the Momentus IPO next month, which is going public through a SPAC called **SRAC**. You can buy options on SRAC right now.

Momentus makes space vehicles that stay in space and take payloads to higher orbits or even lunar orbits. Think of it like package delivery. UPS flies your package to a major city, then a truck delivers your package to your house. Momentus acts as the local truck  except its in space.

These days, there are so many small satellites being put into space. The companies that own the satellites pay for a ride on a large rocket. But that rocket delivers them only to a centralized location. A Momentus vehicle will be waiting in space to deliver them to their precise location in orbit.

Big rockets primarily go into lower-Earth orbits. Momentus vehicles can go into higher-Earth orbits or even lunar orbits and do it for much cheaper.

Momentus has customers including NASA, Lockheed Martin and others. It will put its first vehicle, called Vigoride, into space this month aboard a SpaceX rocket.

CEO Mikhail Kokorich has started several space companies, including publicly traded EchoStar.

The company also has some A-list investors, including Bill Ackman through his venture capital firm Prime Movers Lab.

There is precedence for this kind of successful deal. Virgin Galactic merged into a SPAC. Since going public, the stock has nearly tripled, and at one time, it was up more than four times its pre-IPO price.

**Catalyst**

The big catalyst will be the completion of the merger between Momentus and Stable Road Acquisition Corp., which will trigger the IPO of Momentus. It will trade under the ticker MNTS.

**Position**

Shares (looking a 2x gain at minimum) or the **Feb 17.50 calls**

Title: GME DD crossing the Shermancon edition.
We had the pleasure of having [Uberkikz11](/u/Uberkikz11) in for an [interview](https://anchor.fm/modernguilt/episodes/EP27--NEXT-STOP--GAMESTOP-MOON-BASE-ensdq6) and he dropped some good insight that I'll share here on everything Gamestop. Uberkiks11 has done DD so deep that he's basically an oracle at this point so strap in and get ready. I'll try and throw some key points down that I haven't seen covered in a lot of the other Gamestop DD. 

## the GME situation.

It should be no secret by now that people have been shifting away from Brick and Motor retailers and convenience shopping has largely shifted to online. We've all been fudded to death with blockbuster analogies and the rise of online gaming and steam. So why would anyone ever step foot in a Gamestop? 

While true that people are shifting away from standard brick and motor they are also seeking human interaction and experiential retail experiences. Part of the Sherm overhaul is specifically focusing on making these stores hubs to get expert knowledge from, and talk shit about peoples favorite games. 

You know who loves to hang out in stores and endlessly talk about fantasy worlds with clerks and then spend money? Gamers, the lonely and Otakus all of which were packing out a local EB games (NZ Gamestop) and it was packed not only with people buying games but verbally shitposting at the clerks about the finer points of the Halo nerf gun and its accuracy compared to the game, which frankly as bullish as all the people walking out of there with EB game bags. 

Over this side of the world our internet can be a little shithouse some times as well. To the point that if you are trying to download a game that is unironically 90GBs it can take 2 days and blow your entire internet cap. This demographic is a lot larger then you think as most people don't have the patience or time to wait for the latest game hot the market. So no people are not going to be only downloading through online stores quite just yet. Also gamers love to show their collection. Its a mark of pride to show the your evolution and lineage from the first disk of Crash Bandicoot to your modern day COD collection. 

Another addition I haven't seen mentioned in any recent DD is that the new PS5 only has 667GBs of storage. That is absolutely not hard to pack out with a few modern games and the ability to have more storage is disabled, to be [enabled on a future update](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551165/sony-ps5-playstation-5-no-m2-ssd-expansion-launch).

## okay but what about the massive amount of losses?

Part of these losses was writing off GOODWILL which is comprised of intangible assets which essentially means THEY DIDN'T LOSE ANYWHERE NEAR AS MUCH ACTUAL DOLLARS. They were writing off the fact they pissed their customers off and drove the brand name into the mud. So it is entirely likely they can return to profitability and soon after and its worth remembering that even a hateful emotional attachment is top of mind when stuck at 57.4 GB. Don't be fooled by the sly bear saying the company is going bankrupt they have more then enough cash to see them through until Sherms strategy plays itself out or they eventually kick him out for failing at his job. 

## But what about the revenue miss and the stores closing how can that possibly be bullish? or how I learned to stop worrying and love Sherman.

Prior to shutting the stores GME was everywhere and had infested malls to the point of absurd inefficiency. There was a point where within the small mall there were multiple gamestops that were essentially competing with each other. As it is physical stores are ridiculously expensive to run. A good action to take in when you have too many stores and there is a shift online would be to close down unneeded stores and focus more on online shopping. And guess what? Thats exactly what the Sherm omniclose strat is all about. That's why when people say that closing 1000 stores is bullish, that while yes it will drop revenue, it will also allow Gamestop to focus more intently on profitable stores and Ecommerce. 

Then there is the shift towards a greater product line like console accessories, gaming headsets and focused advertising. This is part of building an experiential service that will be a league against companies like amazon that can't customize for hardcore gamers who lets face it are fanatics when it comes to their genre of choice. Despite Sherms shitty corporate speak they are actually somewhat following Cohens letter just on Boomer time. 

## Beyond the Cohen rainbow

We should all be aware of Cohen at this point. But there are actually more big dogs then Cohen and Burry betting that GME is going to turn around. What I've seen missing is Daniel Foss the billionaire and Senvest who "employs a contrarian, value-based investment strategy " or specialize in underdogs due for a comeback. Why would they do that? because they also see the big opportunity of a Gamestop turn around with sensible fiscal management and a turn towards being a multi product eCommerce store. So you're not alone in your holdings and its backed by some very big players in the game. 

## Where this leaves us?

So even ignoring the Ryan Cohen X factor, the short squeeze, and the other X factors this stock is a total value play. There is some much more detailed posts out there, notably the [infinity war](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4csaa/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century_part/) post that dives into the numbers also worth a look at is [Uberkikz11](/u/Uberkikz11) profile and associated accounts you can find on his profile. The additional X factors that could take this from a strong value play to an actual lottery ticket is Cohen and the infamous short squeeze but thats a story for another day. 

The Tl:dr is People still buy physical games, PS5 has limited space so yes physical disks aren't going away this console cycle. GME is shifting into bigger product categories, and they are backed by serious money. If you want to listen to Uberkiks11 go further into depth into the history of GME and the intricacies of this play you can listen and frankly do a much better job then this rough summary you can hear him in [full here](https://anchor.fm/modernguilt/episodes/EP27--NEXT-STOP--GAMESTOP-MOON-BASE-ensdq6)

Positions: 2122 shares in GME $13.87 cost basis and more when I can.

Title: PLTR will moon soon. I got proof.
As you cuckies might have heard, the rumor started that Facebook and Allianz are now throwing $$ into Palantir by incorporating Foundry into their business.

Now, since you all can't speak any language besides English, due to gambling your little lifesavings away while watching Dora the Cuck, I've webscraped many online job portals to find even more newly created jobs with Palantir knowledge as a requirement. I had to endure reading Spanish and German job posts, so you know this shit is legit. If you don't believe me, look into the URLs I pasted in the comments. Mods banned my post for having too many links pasted in a post, so deal with it.

Am I saying PLTR's platforms will be as crucial (or maybe more) to a company as Microsoft's while having only 1/35 of its current market cap? Yes. Is it great news that many of these new companies are European since the brr dollar won't be worth shit in the next years? Yes. Am I saying PLTR will moon while we hear news about all these new clients? Yes. Can you ban me if PLTR doesn't hit 50$ by end of 2021? Yes.

**TLDR**: **Fresh Foundry clients are ABBVIE, Accenture, AT&amp;T, BMW, Boeing, Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG, Merck, Unicredit. Buy the rumor.**

Title: How S&amp;P inclusion bursts the Tesla bubble
Ever since June (at $200/share), Tesla stock has been driven by a perpetual motion machine of hype and call option flows -- nothing more. And everyone knows it.  Here's what not everyone knows: 

When a stock joins the S&amp;P 500, it becomes part of a massive volatility complex, which is a terrifying web of arbitrage and pseudo-arbitrage relationships. Tesla will join the index as a top-ten component of a cap-weighted index. It's big. 

Its bigness will allow all manner of dispersion, relative value, and market-making traders to begin relying on Tesla's newfound correlation to the index. This will invariably cause arbitrageurs to buy SPX options/vol and sell TSLA options/vol to "close the spread." 

Since Tesla stock is driven by the returns on call options, it is a slave to "vanna": the relationship between option prices (implied volatility) and delta (stock exposure).  In other words, since June, $TSLA goes up only when implied volatility (IV) goes up (purple line is IV).

 When Tesla joins the index, these historic call option flows and the hype machine behind them will hit the big red fire truck that is the S&amp;P, at 500mph  Implied volatility will be unable to rise. Call options will bleed value. New flows will be absorbed by real traders. 

 With the call option hype trade hampered, the stock will have no possibility of further returns -- a deliciously ironic end to the ugliest of 'RobinhoodApp's' many ugly children.  And an appropriately ironic fate for Tesla -- a victim of its own "success."

Title: STLD (Steel Dynamics) as an alternative to MT and X for steel
My first DD post since everybody seems to be jumping on the steel bandwagon (MT and X), here's a ticker that's kinda flown under the radar:  
  
#STLD (Steel Dynamics)   
  
From its Wiki page:  
  
*With a production capacity of 13 million tons, Steel Dynamics is the 3rd largest producer of carbon steel products in the United States. Steel Dynamics is among the most profitable American steel companies in terms of profit margins and operating profit per ton.*  
  
But here's the juicy part:  
  
**Tesla** is rumored to be getting its steel for its CyberTruck from Steel Dynamics!

Option premiums are pretty cheap right now. It's trading around fair value as per some estimates.

3x  45C 5/21/2021  
  
*10x MT 25C March 2021*

Title: MTS.MC hype
MTS.MC  When you look at the P/E ratio of ArcelorMittal against the steel industry as a whole it is currently at 4.6 whereas the industry standard is currently at 15.5 therefore, even as a fundamental ArcellorMittal is currently undervalued within the market. By all means ArcellorMittal should technically be worth 3x more than it is at present.

Title: S&amp;P Inclusion destroys TSLA call trade - Actual DD

When Tesla joins the index, these historic call option flows and the hype machine behind them will hit the big red fire truck that is the S&amp;P, at 500mph

Implied volatility will be unable to rise. Call options will bleed value. New flows will be absorbed by real traders.

With the call option hype trade hampered, the stock will have no possibility of further returns -- a disgustingly ironic end to the most beautiful of @RobinhoodApp's many  children.

And an appropriately ironic fate for Tesla -- a victim of its own "success."

TLDR: arbitrgers killing tsla calls, sorry, the partys over. See you at $1000

Im autistic so obviously I didnt write this @squeezemetrics  fuck you

Title: Here's a short DD on $CRSR
 As per request from the daily thread

Corsair is basically a high-end gaming and streaming equipment company that serves digital athletes.  Their equipment is PC related rather than console related.

The good: Looking at their 10Q (the place where the numbers hide) from Q3 2020, we see that their gross profits have nearly doubled from this time last year.  They are achieving this through increased revenues of \~60% as well as decreasing the cost of revenue in relation to their revenue created by \~7%.  It is great to see a company that is in a strong growth phase and is still very profitable.  

Corsair is also increasing its cash holdings, nearly tripling what they had saved in cash this time last year.  This cash is from its September IPO though.  Assets are steadily increasing while liabilities are flat.  Their liabilities have rotated to more short term rather than long.  This comes from pretty aggressive debt repayment and an increase in accounts payable.  This is bueno.  

Cash flows also look great.  Fundamentally this company slaps.  

Also, the video game industry is a great one to be in.  Currently, the global video game market is valued at about $160 billion and is expected to have a CAGR of about 13%.  So we know the industry isnt going anywhere.

The bad: the company is trading at 72x earnings currently (Based on $37.47 share price and $0.52 EPS.  This leads me to think that CRSR has very high expectations going into its next earnings announcement.  These expectations could lead to some serious short term volatility if earnings dont go as planned.  Also, the IPO market is ridiculous right now and seemingly points to the bubble that we are likely in.  This could also just be the result of so many unprofitable IPOs recently that investors are happy to finally see a company with good fundamentals and not just pixie dust and unicorn farts. 

I think if it were me Id be buying LEAPS like maybe 12/17 2021 $60c.  Possibly even pair it with some short-dated puts. 

TLDR; good company but I think a lot of people know that already so its value could be pretty inflated.

Title: $WW will MOON during DIET SEASON 
The rockets in the title should be enough to convince most of you, but for those looking for a bit more spice:

2020 has been a bitch, and the Freshman 15 has become the quarantine 15. Everybody is packing some extra luggage which is a massive opportunity. **Q1 is always $WWs strongest quarter because its diet season, and this will be the biggest diet season in history.** Every Karen and Becky will have their new years resolution to lose the weight they put on. Seriously, think about it. 2021 is like new beginnings - people can finally see the light of being able to socialize, go on vacation, etc, and you best believe everyone is going to be working their ass off to get back into shape.

This puppy is set to moon. **Look at the magical run it had in 2018,** and the company is much better suited now than they ever were. They are partnered with Ciara now to cater to the Beckys out there, while Oprah caters to the Karens. They are much more focused on their digital wellness app then in person programs which are much higher margin.

I seriously think this thing is going to absolutely moon this diet season and Im buying March calls and plan to sell the day they drop the news about how many new subscribers they got from the record diet season

This stock is insanely CHEAP, only 13.5x forward PE. There is so much opportunity for multiple expansion when this company shows insane growth for this diet season

TLDR: Everybody needs to lose weight before reopen, Edit: April $40 Calls

Title: Apple new hidden iOS 14.3 will likely destroy FB, ZNGA
iOS 14.3 included a bunch of shit, but the most important feature isn't even included in [https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-14-3-features/](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-14-3-features/).

Enter app privacy labels: [https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/14/app-store-privacy-labels-ios-14-3/](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/14/app-store-privacy-labels-ios-14-3/).

These things are insane for absolutely fucking anything that sells a shit ton of data. For example look at robinhood: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/robinhood-investing-for-all/id938003185](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/robinhood-investing-for-all/id938003185). They collect a shit ton of financial information, but that is expected. However, look at something like Instagram: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252). They absolutely collect everything. I'm surprised people aren't already significantly complaining about it. Once this reaches mainstream, people will start complaining on Twitter about Facebook and Facebook will either have to suffer a loss of customers, or they will change their policies to collect less information.

There are probably smaller market cap companies that will be affected much more by this, such as ZNGA, which sells location data to advertisers and depends entirely on mobile games. ZNGA puts are also extraordinarily cheap right now, they are priced for about the last week where ZNGA rose significantly. There are likely a plethora of stocks that may be affected by this news.

As well as this, AAPL and FB are having a bit of a fight, AAPL will likely win and the recent stock price comparison of the two reflects this. 

tl;dr: Apple's new update revealed that Facebook attempts to collect your credit score, other data. FB and other mobile app companies that sell data bearish, AAPL bullish.

Pos: Only long AAPL shares so far, will probably get my first ever put of 9p 1/15 on ZNGA at open tomorrow.

Title: CCJ - BULLISH but be cautious of ELEVATED IV
Ive been seeing a lot of posts on CCJ and why we should be bullish on it. I certainly am! I have no positions yet but was doing my DD to see how options are looking.

For the sake of my fellow autists tendies: the IV on CCJ calls is ELEVATED, with an IV rank of 83% - so IV is 33% above the median. Think of Black Scholes when valuing an option. Volatility is one of the variables. Hence these premiums are a little jacked up compared to the norm. Not saying this is an immediate deal breaker, again Im super bullish, but I just wanted to point that out as I dont know how many folks check for IV rank and historical IV. There MIGHT be a better time to enter.

Title: The MSFT  is just getting started, get in while IV is low
\*\*\*\*TLDR BELOW WITH POSITIONS\*\*\*\*

Longtime Microsoft bull here with 10 years in the IT hardware and software sales field.

Following the september runoff, many tech stocks (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN) have found themselves stuck in a range of resistance, leaving IV in the gutter. Now, tech bulls have returned with AAPL mooning and AMZN and MSFT showing some signs of life.

After 1 month, MSFT finally broke 217 and tested 220 today, but IV is still relatively low at 23.4%.

**MSFT for the short term -**

\- Some random whale threw 37 M on February calls

\- Recently reinstated as a buy by BofA

\- Broke threw resistance and even climbed higher- Stimulus seeming inevitable

\- Smart money is bullish

**MSFT for the long term -**

\- GREAT leadership - Satya Nadella transformed this company by investing in cloud and AI - this man has a vision for his company unlike other CEOs (looking at you Intel)

\- Recently acquired Bethesda, great for long term growth, esports are rapidly growing

\- Azure cloud is becoming a larger and larger competitor to AWS and Oracle - AWS began dominant, but Azure is clawing market share slowly

\- Teams and office 365 are irreplacable to companies and schools, covid cemented that

\- decent valuation with a solid p/s and p/e

Options are still cheap, so I'm picking up shares, leaps, and some shorter dated calls as the stock dips.

**TLDR: Microsoft is a strong company short and long term, recently broke through resistance and will climb freely in the coming weeksShares and leaps for the weak, calls expiring in a month for the brave**

**Positions: Jan 15th 225 C, April 16th 240 C, lots of shares**

Title: Steel Shortage Incoming. Prices and Demand Increasing. MT taking us to the top of Mount Tendies
Every article you see on the internet is about demand of steel increasing and not enough supply. Which is taking price per ton of steel to the highs of 2018.

Ask any steel buyer and they say they see price increasing into 2021. Go ask r/steel. They've said the same thing. Steel producers are making buyer their cucks and keep increasing their price and no end to sight. 86% of steel buyers polled say they are expecting to continuing to get raw dogged by producers and the price increasing: [https://www.thefabricator.com/thefabricator/article/metalsmaterials/steel-prices-defy-predictions-of-a-peak](https://www.thefabricator.com/thefabricator/article/metalsmaterials/steel-prices-defy-predictions-of-a-peak)

There is basically a shortage and will continue to get greater. "Right now, it doesn't matter what I am willing to pay for steel, there is not steel available to be had" ([https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/videos/market-movers-americas/121420-crude-moves-higher-caution-vaccine](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/videos/market-movers-americas/121420-crude-moves-higher-caution-vaccine))

They expect to keep being cucks to the producers until Q1 at least.

In short, there is not enough steel to go around. Not even enough for the autist's helmets in this sub. The shortage is starting and expecting to carry over into 2021. Last time their was a shortage in steel around 2011 MT was around 100. The last time the prices were this high per ton for steel in 2018, MT was at 39.

Don't be a retard and buy weeklies. Buy a couple months out. MT is going to kill their earnings in early Feb

Title: $SFIX -- they sell clothes online and basically doubled in a week
 Stitch Fix (SFIX), a retail e-commerce company (they market it as an online personal styling service), had an 85% runup in 9 days; driven by a beat on revenue growth expectations last quarter

**Quantitative considerations/the story so far (pull up chart when reading this):**

Before earnings, there was a lot of short interest in the shares themselves, with around 40% of the float short. On the option chain, the $35 strike puts had really high open interest/volume (i think someone on r/thecorporation said it was a good play so it got piled into). 

This massive imbalance in puts vs. calls was the reason behind the massive 38% gap up after reporting. In order to hedge the puts they sell, market makers have to short shares. When results were good, MMs took the opportunity to rapidly cover all their shorted shares and forced a short squeeze to destroy all the puts they sold (also exploiting IV crush around earnings). All the other shorts also had to start covering, and the put destruction/short squeeze created the huge 38% gap.  

Then, seeing the 38% gap, retail traders all FOMOd in, and call options on the 12/18 chain were relentlessly pumped  first the $50 strike, then $55, $60, and $65. In the same way as the puts above, market makers hedge sold calls by buying shares, and have to buy more and more shares as those options get closer to being in the money  this feedback loop + the feedback loop from shorts/put destruction has been behind the pump the whole last week. 

Volume started to drop off at $65 level and the sellers started to return this week  option flow indicators had increased activity in 12/24 SFIX puts as whales decided they had enough of the pump (insiders btw were dumping shares as soon as the stock crossed $50 lol). 

The stock was rolling over and dropped to around $63 until the FOMC pump happened and the whole market went up, and big green candles from MMs re-hedging puts that got destroyed + exhausted shorts covering caused the final pump to $66 today.

**Current setup/prediction:**

As it stands now, we have insanely overextended call positioning on the 12/18 expiry, but this quickly flips towards more balance between calls/puts on 12/24 expiry because of the earlier put buys from whales at $60 and below strikes on Mon/Tues (a lot of these contracts are at huge discounts right now from when the big boys bought them lol).

This means that market makers currently have a lot of SFIX shares ready to dump (they were forced to buy them all by call pumpers). They can dump on Friday to try and kill the calls before expiry, or just wait for all the OTM calls to expire and dump all the shares Monday morning when they no longer have to hedge. This selling volume will start to drive the share price back down.

Now, consider how the 12/18 expiry and resulting sale of shares will affect how market makers hedge the 12/24 options. This time they have also sold a large amount of puts, and as these puts get closer to the money, MMs will have to short more and more shares to hedge their deltas/gammas, creating the same feedback loop that caused the pump but in reverse. 

*TLDR:*

Pre-earnings, the overextended positioning in puts caused a massive upward feedback loop, and MMs took advantage and covered all their shares to create a short/put squeeze. 

Pre-12/18 opex, the overextended positioning in calls will cause a similar downward feedback loop when MMs dump shares and create a call/long squeeze, and we can amplify this by piling into puts.

From Investopedia: Long squeezes are more common in assets that have seen a dramatic price rise with very high volume occurring when the price turns lower (dip before earnings followed by massive rip), and in low liquidity or low float stocks (check and check)

**Fundamental considerations:**

&gt; keep in mind these barely matter in the short term, especially in this postmodern market, but it does add some color to why there are still people who want to short + explains part of why MMs don't hold their shares (aside from the 85% run in basically a week lol)

Online e-commerce has outperformed wildly in the COVID market, and stocks like Etsy, Wayfair, Shopify, etc. have killed it. One main reason for this is the fact that consumers travel/entertainment budgets have basically been nuked due to the pandemic, and that wallet share has flowed over to retail  specifically, e-commerce.

While pandemic trends led to a strong couple quarters for SFIX, dont expect these tailwinds to last forever. Now that we have a vaccine, the focus of the market has shifted from pandemic to reopening  commodity stocks, airlines, cruises, brick and mortar retail all have been running up in the recent weeks. The wallet share that has flown to retail will quickly return to travel/entertainment, as pent up customers will love the chance to go outside again. Money that still remains in consumer retail budgets wont all stay in e-commerce; many people will go right back to malls and stores to shop. The coming year will likely be a tougher one for SFIX, especially with high pandemic growth to compare to as the new standard.

Furthermore, dont be fooled by the companys marketing to frame itself as a tech company deserving of a higher multiple. Its still a retail business at its core, with retail profit margins, not tech profit margins. While they do use recommendation algorithms and data science to personalize clothing items based on size, budget and style, SFIX has a \~44% gross margin, not 80% like the fast growing software companies that actually do deserve a high valuation.

**The play(s):**

The safest play is to thetagang and sell 12/18 calls  this is basically free money when MMs dump hedged shares. 

The high risk/high reward option: buy 12/24 puts, $60 strike, or $58 strike  thats where all the volume/open interest is for puts. Youre buying what the big boys did for cheaper, and contributing to the feedback loop that will tank the share price when 12/18 options expire.

Medium risk: buy 12/24 $65 strike, sell $60 strike. Spread so not as hurt by IV, less OTM so not as risky.

**The plan:**

Im looking to buy 12/24 puts on any spike tomorrow, and probably gonna hold until Monday morning if not longer. If enough of us buy puts, the resulting feedback loop will be massive and super profitable. 

These feedback loops that come from MM hedging flows are the key to trading meme stocks profitably  keep a sharp eye out for when MMs have an incentive to squeeze one side or the other, and join in for max tendies. 

Tip: the feedback loops/squeezes always happen near earnings/opex because thats usually when sentiment/positioning is at its most skewed

Title: MRNA Going Down Fast
This is not my DD, just found it in an investing group and its really detailed. The TL;DR of this is that MRNA is going down fast after the general population gets wind of normal people having semi-severe reactions to the second shot of the MRNA 2 shot vaccine.  One person in the trial who experienced a severe reaction said that it was 50x worse than any vaccine he has ever experienced. Another person who had a severe reaction said "I was sitting by the phone all night long wondering if I should call 911". Once the media gets wind of these stories cropping up MRNA is in big trouble.

Hopefully you've been holding for at least a month or two and this doesn't come as a surprise to you. There's been great DD on here. H C A C is a SPAC merging with Canoo, an EV company building customizable vehicles for retail, b2b, and industry that rely on a proprietary 'skateboard' (base electrical mainframe with a vehicle's four wheels) and 'top hat' system (different model builds, the 'type' of car, gets attached to the skateboard) that enables concurrent production lines. They can pump them out, and they have a deal with Hyundai to use Hyundai's production infrastructure. Production speed is already outpacing competition just in prototypes. The leadership is ex-BMW and -VW Audi designers/engineers.

You can check out the vehicle design here [https://www.canoo.com/design/](https://www.canoo.com/design/) and the real gold here [https://investors.canoo.com](https://investors.canoo.com), the investor presentation is unreal. They have a great product and plan to bring to market. Where they're really changing the game is the subscription model - "transportation as service" - which includes the vehicle, insurance, customizability (factory printed and applied, artist-designed skins). You should check it out for yourself and see if you like the vision. Regardless, price is going up. This is a company that can easily go to $50, surpass a NIO, and hit $100+ on Tesla's back. Average volume in November was under 500k and now we're seeing 7+ mil. They presented at Credit Suisse last week and this week they'll reveal the B2B product. Next week the ticker changes and then it's really over. Long calls and shares on dips. Hopefully you caught the holiday sale yesterday. If not, watch carefully.

To all my H bag holders, we ride baby.

That's where Innoviz comes into play. They're relatively new to the SPAC game and after seeing a quick surge during the initial announcement, the SPAC smackdown has kindly dropped this into the purchasing range - at least for the time being.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Innoviz and why should I care?**

&gt;"Innoviz is a leading provider of high-performance, solid-state LiDAR sensors and perception software that enable the mass production of autonomous vehicles."

The SPAC, Collective Growth Corp - aka \[**C G R O**\], has taken on the challenge of reverse merging with Innoviz, providing a short window of tendie opportunity for the masses.

[https://innoviz.tech/](https://innoviz.tech/)

&amp;#x200B;

**The Facts**

* Valuation of 1.4 Billion with 350m proceeds
* *SHAREHOLDERS RETAIN 100% EQUITY &lt;-------------------* ***This is incredibly rare, usually a lot lower***
* Expected merger in Q1 under the ticker \[I. N. V. Z.\]
* The only LiDAR provider that meets the stringent requirements of automotive OEMS
* Production is expected to start in 2021
* Partnered with BMW to be used in their autonomous vehicles
* Can be used for robotaxis, delivery vehicles and drones as well

&amp;#x200B;

Now we all know that there's a couple other LiDAR companies floating around the WSB universe. Both Luminar and Velodyne have both done very well in regards to stock price and this goes to show that LiDAR is an important aspect in the EV future. The Luminar rocket was insane.

&amp;#x200B;

**Luminar** is currently trading at **24.45**

**Velodyne** is currently trading at **20.10**

&amp;#x200B;

This is why time is of the essence. Thanks to Innoviz being relatively new/under the radar and the current SPAC correction we're experiencing, the stock is currently trading in the ***11******'s***

***One can argue that there is plenty of room to grow. This company already has a partnership with BMW and will be a large player in the LiDAR game. Go check out their LiDAR videos on the current website.***

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: New global leader in LiDAR sensors play that's under the radar and trading at a steal of a price thanks to SPAC correction. Two direct competitors, Luminar and Velodyne, are both trading well above Innoviz's SPAC price - only a matter of time until this ticker follows suit. Luminar has Volvo? We have BMW.

Title: Amazon gave BB a blank check
See the PR on December 1st, where BB announced it and amazon are in a multiyear global partnership. Numbers weren't released because they don't want to get sued for fraud by the SEC, but Amazon basically gave them a blank check. Earnings Thursday after the close, details will be given then.

Title: FOMC Cliff Notes: what actually happened so you dont sound dumb to your friends
**This is an updated version of a previous DD I did on what could come from the FOMC meeting.  I see a lot of wild shit on the daily thread when the market started responding, so I threw this up with some edits to help yall out.**

For months now, each meeting of the FED and Jerome Powell speech has stated the same things in varied terms: 1) We are not raising interest rates 2) We really, really need a congressional stimulus and 3) Yes we are deep in our fucking bag, but we still got Qauntitiative Easing tools, so don't sleep

The first thing to understand is what the 2 popularized big guns of QE are, and that it is very, very unlikely we're going to see change to them.

**1) The lowering of the Federals funds rate**
Current: ~0 (.25%, goal between 0 and .25%)
Last year this time: 1.75%
**Any changes? NO**
The Fed rate is  not increasing, as Powell has made it clear this isn't even on the table until 2023.  The other option--a negative federal interest rate--also didn't happen

**2) Expansion of Fed asset purchases**
Current: $120B (80B of treasuries purchases, 40B of Mortgage-backed securities)
This has been the Fed's most powerful tool in stimulating the markets, particularly the treasuries.  The long and short of it is that the more treasuries the Fed purchases, the more market participants are pressured to buy stonks instead of bonds.
**Any changes? NO**
Given that the stimulus talks are up and down and important economic factors like weekly jobs numbers are tanking, there has been reserved optimism that the Fed could decide to expand it's balance sheet on asset purchases.  JPOW chose not to create panic by expanding this

If those changes were unlikely, why did the market not immediately love it?  Or why has it been up and down? Because some market participants were holding out for...

**1) Fed weaking not the amountbut instead whichtreasuries they purchase, shuffling around the 80B to longer dated maturities**
The Fed could've decide to fuck around with the steepening yield curve.  By moving their purchases to more longer dated bond maturities (for example, shifting more of the 80B QE fund to purchasing 20/30 year maturity bonds instead of 10) they could've ended up providing a fairly large boost to stonk purchases without actually spending more money overall on the balance sheet.  There was chatter that the Fed wants to do whatever is possible to keep yields on the 20 at 1% or lower, and they didn't make that move.
**Did it happen? NO**

**2) Outcome-based guidance**
This sounds like bullshit but it's not.  This essentially means "the Fed will tie QE for 2021 to how the economy performs".  The reason it's not bullshit is because, without discussing the Federal funds rate, it gives both the public and (probably more importantly) Congress an idea of what kind of footing the economy needs to be on, by when, and how the Fed will respond.
Did this happen? YES
But it was pretty vanilla language.

**TLDR**: The FOMC meeting released info that was exactly as expected, but markets are a little disappointed/up and down absurdly because they didn't offer more aggressive stonk stimulus by moving around their investments in bond maturity updates.

**Positions: this is more info than predictions but Im leaning:**
TLT calls during the dip
No SPY calls until stimulus since there was no additional help
VXX hedged (higher than usual) on monthlies (20c) in preparation for stimmy fail debacle or sell the news

*Ill update tonight if anything big comes out of this press conference, and quick news and moves aggregated here and on my twitter @yourboymilt since theres no notification format for Reddit (sorry mods, not my fault).*

Title: AC.TO WILL MAKE MAJOR TENDIES
Im going to keep this brief.

Air Canada (AC.TO) is the flag-carrying airline for Canada. They will be bailed out. If you look at the charts, you will see that they peaked at a little over $50 CAD. They are under $24 RIGHT NOW. I cant make this any clearer. THEY WILL RECOVER, and maybe moon and set new all time highs. BUY. THE. DIP. TENDIES AWAIT

Title: XII  get the tendies now while there cheap
[**DD**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?q=flair_name%3A%22DD%22&amp;restrict_sr=1)

XXII is a leading plant-based, biotechnology company that is focused on technologies that alter the level of nicotine in tobacco plants and the level of cannabinoids in hemp/cannabis plants through genetic engineering, gene-editing, and modern plant breeding.

They are waiting on approval from the FDA for their reduced nicotine content VLN cigarettes. 22nd Century believes that authorization of the companys MRTP (modified risk tobacco) application is imminent, and it plans to launch VLN cigarettes within just 90 days of authorization.

They have technology that controls the amount of nicotine in a cigarette. The FDA will soon require all cigarettes sold in the U.S. to have reduced nicotine minimally or to non addictive levels. 22nd Century is the leader in reduced nicotine content tobacco products. And, they are committed to license their technology so that every cigarette manufacturer in the U.S. to comply with the standard.

This stock has soared over 300% in the last 3 months in anticipation of FDA approval. They will be the first and only company to have a reduced nicotine cigarette on the market. Once approved this company will start making billions. They think they will get approved by the end of this year.

Positions: 100 shares and $5c 1/15

Title: SWI - Buy the dip = 
 We've all seen the news, that got hacked. But how many of you actually understand what they do? Here's the run down:

The product that got hacked is a well known, well used, piece of software that helps organizations more easily manage networks. Organizations pour millions into the projects to get this shit setup, and once it's setup, they do not want it to change. SolarWinds does pretty good at making sure the shit you set up continue to work. And, for the most part, people LIKE the software (event though a lot of people have some qualms about their sales guys).

So they got hacked, big whoop. Over 400 of the F500 companies use their product. These ancient and slow moving companies who run projects for over a year to get a piece of software like this installed and working. Do you REALLY think that they're going to try and replace it? The answer is NO. The most likely scenario is gonna be this:

IT/Sec team: 'hey this software got hacked, Mr. budget guy in the business dept can we have money to replace it?'

mr budget business guy: 'o no, is it broken? how much cost'

IT/Sec team: 'its not broken but we lost data :(, uhh millions and a lot of time'

mr budget guy: 'did they fix it'

IT/SEC team: 'yes but we dont feel good about them'

mr budget guy: 'ok just use the fix since we already paid for '

IT/Sec team: 'ok :('

tldr; buy the dip

Title: Bull Case for LAZR - Next Potential TSLA
Brought to you by the retard who made $3 million by YOLOing into NVAX (peep the profile), here is my next play. I recently liquidated the majority of my NVAX shares and dumped the rest of my money into LAZR.

For those who don't know LAZR is a Peter Thiel backed company specializing in LiDAR technology for vehicles, that just underwent a SPAC merger. This caused the stock to skyrocket 300% within three weeks. The stock is still up 150% just this month even following this past week of consolidation and bad news.

The main reason that the stock was falling this past week, aside from consolidation was due to a hit piece by Shitron (Citron). If you are part of this community you know that Citron is utter market manipulating dogshit. It started to recover yesterday, until news came that Mobileye (an Intel subsidiary) would be producing its own in-house LiDAR technology. This caused the stock to fall another 20%.

However, this was a complete market overreaction. The main reason for recovery today is that LAZR was given a price target of $41 by Northland's Gus Richard (a 5 star analyst, much more competent than the retards at Citron), as well as an upgrade from Market Preform (Hold) to Outperform (Buy). If every thing goes as planned, they will not have produced in house sensors by 2025. He stated that he doubts Intel would be able to successfully produce this in time.  Given Intel's terrible year with their chips, there should not be much confidence behind them.

LAZR still has several contracts with companies such as Volkswagen, Volvo and Daimler, and even NIO in China, with products releasing throughout 2021 and 2022. As time goes on, only more contracts will be acquired.

If you are bullish on any of the Chinese electric vehicle stocks, you should be bullish on LiDAR as well as they are using this technology in their car. Even Elon Musk is afraid of this technology. The fact that he is denouncing this technology clearly indicates to me that it is a threat to him.

Why LAZR over VLDR?

VLDR is the industry leader. However, it is clear that LAZR's sensors are much more powerful and cheaper to produce. The CEO literally invented a brand new microchip because the current ones in the market weren't good enough. Speaking of the CEO, he is a big dick 25 year old youngest new billionaire in the world. He was given 100,000 by Thiel to drop out of Stanford and pursue LAZR.Ignore this next part if you are not familiar with the technology, but for those who are, VLDR uses a LiDAR unit that stacks 64 lasers in a vertical column and spins the whole thing around many times per second. This is incredibly expensive to produce. LAZR instead uses a single mirror to focus and guide its lazer, making it significantly cheaper.

TLDR: Buy LAZR. Backed by Peter Thiel, just recently given a price target of $41.

Title: LMND: The Tesla of Insurance
Lemonade is disrupting the insurance industry in the same way Tesla disrupted the automotive industry. First off, Lemonade takes out agents (and their expensive commissions) and instead use AI. In addition, they use chatbots so that people can get a new policy and have a claim processed in a couple minutes. Plus, they have insanely good reviews by everyone who uses their service.

On top of this, insurance is a larger industry than cars, so Lemonade has the potential to grow even larger than Tesla is right now. It is only at a 5bn dollar evaluation. Imagine being one of those autists that got Tesla leaps a year ago.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

Title: The most undervalued SPAC is CGRO
So CGRO just announced a deal with a company in Israel called Innoviz its a lidar company with some pretty serious partnerships including BMW, Magna, Softbank and many more, but not only that the price of their Lidar systems is competitively cheaper than all of its competitors by a big distance i encourage everyone to research this,but the valuation here is so low that it is just ridiculous let me show you what i am talking about:
VLDR which recently went public with their spac deal is worth 3.5b right now and has a target from a big hedge fund to go up another 50% from its current level.
LAZR has a marketcap of 10b it is partnered with Volvo or atleast has an upcoming partnership with them and mobileye.
Now compare this to CGRO/ innoviz current valuation of only 1.4b despite it having these impressive partnerships im seeing a massive misprice here and have decided to invest heavily you do the math if you think its worth it.

I haven't seen any DD posts about this, but why buy the cow when you can buy the farm.

Title: $EBR Brazilian Privatization play
So the brazilian government is broke and has been trying (unsuccessfully) to sell EBR, the national electricity company of Brazil, since 2019. 

The stock is currently trading at around $7 from a high of $12 in september 2019, so the market is pricing a zero probability of this occurring.

**Why is the market so skeptic regarding this event?**

Brazil's President, Jair Bolsonaro, and the Speaker of the  House of Representatives, Rodrigo Maia, hate each other guts (think Trump and Pelosi), blocking any attempt of getting this privatization through congress. 

**So why should i buy this shit company ?**

Rodrigo Maia term as Speaker of the House is finishing in january 2021 and he has been blocked from running another term by the Supreme Court. This was totally unexpected, everyone in Brazil thought he was gonna be reelected.

[https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2020/12/brazils-supreme-court-bars-attempt-to-trample-the-constitution-for-the-re-election-of-maia-and-alcolumbre-in-congress.shtml](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2020/12/brazils-supreme-court-bars-attempt-to-trample-the-constitution-for-the-re-election-of-maia-and-alcolumbre-in-congress.shtml)

Bolsonaro was extremely happy with this news, and has started campaigning to get one of his allies, Arthur Lira, as Speaker of the House.

**The election is happening on the 1st of february. If Lira wins against Maia's nominee you can expect $EBR to rocket back to $12, and eventually even higher.**

 **TL;DR ** Buy $EBR in expectation of higher odds of Privatization.

Title: More love for Redfin part 2??
So this is the second time in the last 5 months that Ive done a post on Redfin. Back then, it was a pretty stock, but now its gorgeous. Up over 50% on my position from early November and was buying and selling in the 40s ranges before that. A part of me wishes I had bought calls on it, but tbh I didnt expect this massive bull run anyway so oh well ig.

I still am bullish on this and the whole sector. Redfins market cap is under 7.5 billion as I write this. Zillows is over 30 billion. While Ill admit that I have positions in both, I am much more bullish on Redfin long term for one simple reason: its a superior service. Well at least I think it is. Both are great, but I much prefer Redfin based on what Ive seen. I havent bought or sold a house on it but I feel like their valuations for properties are much more accurate than Zillows and I like the user interface on their website better. I think it is very possible that we could see a significantly larger market cap for Redfin long term. Is it overvalued right now? Probably, but so is 99% of WSBs favorite stocks, so who cares??

Please do your own DD and dont get mad at me if it drops significantly as Im not qualified to give DD in the first place lol

Title: CHL: A play on a Biden win cooling off China tensions
I've been looking for a potentially good play that is bound to pay up with a Biden win. Sure all the usual suspects are already on the list (green energy, ev plays, short private prisons) but I was looking for something that can have a marked reversal but has been under the radar and I think I found it.

**Calls on CHL ($35 price point or above, DTE of at least 6 months)**

Why CHL?

1) This is the biggest telecom company in China (on a subscriber base) paying a very stable dividend and now yielding 7%. From all fundamental basis the company should be trading at least 30% higher.

2) CHL has been pummeled by all out Trump rethoric and most recently by the ban through executive order ([https://www.barrons.com/articles/order-against-owning-some-chinese-stocks-might-not-be-as-bad-as-it-sounds-51605220714](https://www.barrons.com/articles/order-against-owning-some-chinese-stocks-might-not-be-as-bad-as-it-sounds-51605220714))

3) At a time where telecom has been doing great, the 40% correction of CHL solely based on Trump fear is unwarranted.

**So why will it get better?**

1) We got a new President. Yes, Biden will face a litmus test of being "soft on china" and reversing the ban could be a no-go for him. But here's the kicker: this is an executive order by a previous President. Biden can include it in a pool of other orders are "stupid stuff from Trump" reverse them all and done deal. No justification, no anything. This will be looped with so many orders that when the questions come it will be about immigration and EPA regulations. It will fly under the radar as it should because it is a stupid rule that only hurts American investors. CHL does not need access to US markets. 

2) Only about 2% of the float is in the American ADR but it is owned mostly by large funds which still largely retain most of their position throughout all of this ([https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=CHL&amp;subView=institutional](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=CHL&amp;subView=institutional)). Goldman Sachs for example acquired almost 500k shares in September right when Trump rhethoric was heating up. Any move up will happen in a very small float and it won't take long to hit $40 which is a super strong TA support.

TLDR: Calls on CHL &gt;$35 with at least 180DTE

Also, this is not financial advice. I work full time at a circus and this is how spend time between feeding the lions and watching the clowns hit the garden posts.

Title: C3.AI to the moon after options availability
I tried to post yesterday a purchase I had made but it didnt go through, yet I needed post today to share that it paid off:

My concern with new indexes like C3.AI and Airbnb was that of everyone, that they are/were over valued. However, following trends like other tech stocks that were newly available like PLTR to retail investors, these stocks shot up, slumped and start making the climb after options become available.

With Airbnb and AI, however, they had unique IPOs that could/would have had a different trend but as of this morning it seems it is doing  exactly as anticipated and I expect this to continue for 30-45 days like PLTR.

I cant afford any more options on C3.AI or Airbnb but still hope for some hefty gains as Im already up 30 percent. Those looking to buy in, wait until the afternoon when some of the volatility priced in cools off because I made the mistake of buying in at 9am for $15 calls yesterday instead of $12 and theyre currently at $18 and rising. Airbnb is similarly expensive

Concerns: overvaluation and IPO methods may create alternative trends as well as AI being a boomer stock. Also, $TSLA inclusion in the S&amp;P500 May create a tech slump or even crash so that it might be better to wait till Monday or Tuesday next week to buy into this idea.

Positions: $AI 145c 4/16/21

TLDR: buy AI and/or Airbnb calls for 30-45 days out according to similar newly indexed tech stock trends

Title: What goes UUP, must come down.
With stimulus finally about to actually pass, the adding of direct payments to the stimulus package, and the increase in foreign nations buying commodities with US dollar to avoid the impending PP drop, the dollar is about to fall hard. Well past 2018 levels. DX been consistently failing to find support and is currently falling off a cliff on the daily. UUP is a stock symbol from Deutsche Bank that provides exposure to DX (i.e. If DX goes down, UUP goes down). This train is going to stop either after stimulus. 2021 is expected to be a very bad year for the dollar and we could potentially see uup get below 2018 levels of $23. Volatility is still low on options and as long as buy far enough out to allow macroeconomics to balance, guaranteed downward trend for foreseeable 12-18 months. This started in late June too, so this is a bit late. 

$24.5/24 UUP puts 12/24,12/31,1/15

Title: $GOLD  Am I a boomer?
Im pretty sure that barrick gold ($GOLD) is gonna  next year. Between all of the stimulus money and a joe biden election, gold mining stocks are pretty well setup to do good. Plus there is a shortage of silver and gold in the manufacturing space that should start affecting the market next year.

This company was the golden child of roivant, and a Japanese pharmaceutical company sumitomo pharma has come in and bought all 4 of the sister companies to myovant. They now own a ~56% of Myovant. At this point its only a matter of time until they are bought out.

Whats the play? SHARES. Or calls, do whatever you want honestly. I have both.

Positions: shares and calls all the way until 2022. Can Post pic for proof.

Title: Steel + Cybertruck
Listen up Autists, the rumor on WSB is steel stocks are undervalued, currently headlined by $MT. But we can do better than $MT, and there's still plenty of steel left for those who haven't jumped on yet.

The Tesla Cybertruck will be made out of steel from Steel Dynamics. $STLD is building a new 1.7 Billion dollar steel factory a short freight train ride from the new Tesla factory in Texas. Both factories are scheduled to be completed in late 2021, just in time for the Cybertruck deliveries to start. This capital investment alone represents at least a 20% production growth of Steel Dynamics.

Title: Discount on a better vaccine, 2x leverage on it, and a bidding war bonus
Ok degenerates this is a long one, or a short one with TLDR at the end  I definitely dont want another two day ban for too short keeping us all from tendies (tried to post premarket but somehow 2 days is 48 hours) so Im adding everything I found in those days and hours. How about 5 parts like (1)vaccine (2)merger and offer (3)bidding war (4) ALXN $160 resistance and (5) TLDR and move ideas

If you fly this not financial advice to  tendie town on the moon   I wont stop you from sending a pittance back to earth


*Part 1: Vaccine (the better one)*

I see all this loss porn of bets on PFE vaccine and can only ask why? That shit is way past news at this point and for the most part so is Moderna, but more importantly those two vaccines suck. Buy the rumor sell the dip, and youve probably heard -70 degrees for storage and transport but in America thats 100 below... those sciency guys and their lab coats always talk in Celcius. Its damn hard to keep stuff this cold and that means not every clinic, truck, or plane can do it  and if you have something that might be able to do it but shit gets too hot for the *ice queen vaccines* then suddenly you have to throw out a truckload of hard to produce doses.  Shitty


This matters specifically during a pandemic multiple ways. You cant get that kind of low ass temp to most of the worlds population, and where you can get it you still have high transport and storage costs or risks. Add on to that the fact that buyers in a pandemic are governments buying at a low profit margin and acutely aware of these costs and risks.  PFE and MRNA cant match future competition transport prices by cutting into vaccine profits because those are low from the start, and PFE and MRNA cant even get vaccines to huge amounts of the worlds population without completely unreasonable loss and expense  theyll make more money paying AZN half of the difference for AZN to ignore cities and truck to the country.

The AZN vaccine, even in cities, can probably add some profit margin and still come in cheaper per dose for governments because you can produce it easily then throw that shit in a Trader Joes frozen food delivery truck and when it gets to a clinic in the middle of nowhere the clinics hand-me-down fridge from Circuit City is perfectly fine. This is not great for the stock yet as AZN is distributing at cost for the start, but if we find that booster doses are needed then it will definitely matter. This isnt even getting into the fact that the mild first-shot side effects are less likely to prevent people from coming back for their second shot which really helps governments get higher immunity at a lower price.

Now, this vaccine may not be priced in and it may even be discounted by the thing that screwed my AZN 12/31 $54.5c: AZN offered to buy ALXN at a $12B premium.


*Part 2: Merger and Offer (and 2x leverage)*

ALXN officially received an offer where each shareholder gets 2xAZN shares and $60 per share. At the time of the offer that value was $175/share, but did you catch the leverage? Thats right, AZN goes up $2 the offer goes up $4. ALXN is hovering below $160 so $4 is below in percentage to an AZN climb of $2, but calls are in dollars from the strike price not dollars from zero therefore 2x leverage. If youre cray cray, the second ticker might also lag behind the first giving you a chance get in on a movement that already happened over at AZN and maybe even get 2x the price shift.

The timing of the merger being finalized means the movement is not 1:1 (or 1:2) right now, but it will be and consider the next part as a reason to get in sooner. Also, ALXN cant go down hard because the lower AZN goes the lower the percentage correlation will be with a drop in ALXN, and a large drop of say 10% in a company like AZN right after the market corrected AZN is like you and sex with your wife (just not going to happen). The next part also has a reason to expect the merger not to get blocked by regulators, but first lets talk stupidity and whether that AZN correction was irrational.

Ok fellow stupid, one reason this cant go tits up is that the offer was not done by idiots.  You and I certainly dont know more than the board of AZN, but when debating regulatory hiccups and what a fair price was for ALXN the market hasnt realized it knows less about drugs  AZN tanked by as much as $8B implying that maybe the market only wanted them to offer a $4B premium instead of $12B. AZN stated they see a pretty easily attained $500M/year advantage by sharing efforts between the companies, but theres definitely hidden benefits (like competitors not buying ALXN).  I dont know all the synergies they see but among them would be the fact that distribution of drugs, dealing with insurance companies, sending drug pushers into clinics to convince doctors to put pamphlets in your face... it isnt cheap, and right now both companies are probably overlapping a whole lot in these efforts even though they have basically zero overlap in products.


*Part 3: Bidding War*

This bidding war is not just likely, it is likely to get going fast. The next offer could already be on the way to ALXN because a large ALXN activist investor wrote a letter (elliotletters.com has a copy) back in May urging the company to sell  AZN competitors like Amgen, Gilead, Novartis, Eli Lily, PFE and others have definitely been doing their analysis and planning their offers for months, AZN was just first to the table.

The buy value bidders see in ALXN is also why regulators wont stop it.  ALXN focuses on drugs for extremely rare diseases, putting them in a tiny but profitable niche where they dont make anything that competes with the buyer, but they do and need things that the buyers also do an need  theres nothing but synergy potential.  Typically buying a competitor means you might be paying for a bunch of shit that is in the target companys stock value only to compete with you and that is a double hitter because it is a waste of your buying capital and regulators dont like that the merger will kill off consumer choices.

So what does this mean? ALXN is going to get a huge premium in its offers because theres no waste besides the premium, and regulators wont stop it for the same reason. This is why ALXN price targets are up closer to or at the $200 mark now despite that being at least a 60% premium compared to last week  everybody expects a second offer will have to come in near a $200 valuation to be competitive with the 40% premium offer.  AZNs competitors will happily hit that premium to take the $500M/year that AZN says they can get from ALXN (a hard $1B/y swing between AZN and the bidding war opponent on top of any other values the opponent can identify). 

Maybe part of putting so much AZN stock into the offer was to make sure the other companies would have to deal with a moving target that might get FDA approval on a COVID vaccine or pull some other jump that significantly impacts what it takes to match the current offer, but as far as options go I want vaccine on 2x leverage with the bidding war as a big bonus.


*Part 4: ALXN $160 resistance*

How do I know theres $160 resistance? ALXN 12/18 $160c FD just barely wont print and I wanted to know why. If it is what I saw when I looked, were talking dumb resistance that is definitely gonna disappear and looks to be breaking during after hours/pre-market.

The price targets before the merger were about $160, so a bunch of whales started selling off because their standing orders were all near or just below the old price target. Some of it was general profit-taking too, but for sure with a 30% jump already it isnt like any of them were going to take a loss and there was a practical guarantee of an extra 10% in half a year which is a return every boomer dreams about  these resisting boomers will realize the new $200 price target is very reasonable then stop selling below $160 and soon. They might be dumb and sell at 2x AZN + $60, but when the market sees AZNs vaccine it will go up.

*Part 5: TLDR and move ideas*
AZN vaccine is made for global distribution unlike PFE, as long as the calls can theta longer than the market remains irrational they will see 2x the growth of AZN by using calls on ALXN, the standing offer from AZN is free insurance that means ALXN practically cant drop, and you have a decent bonus chance of getting ALXN just before a bidding war starts.

With few paths to a large ALXN drop poots are just premiums, and if I had room to play Id definitely be in on some long and ITM calls.  Safer calls are the ones ending in May or the next set, Jan 2022  but the company will likely be merged before q4 next year. Anything that far out where the break even is around $175 (the valuation given by the AZN offer) should play well for the vaccine and hold well if needed, so maybe ALXN 5/21 $170c or for a painful premium but probably easily sold again soon ALXN 5/21 $155c.

Good luck and good  travels

Title: AUPH set for fireworks in January
Ill give yall this one for free. Aurinia pharmaceuticals is a small Canadian company with a flagship drug, voclosporin awaiting US FDA review and approval after its phase 3 trial. Voclosporin is a drug designed to treat lupus nephritis which, if untreated or poorly treated, leads to kidney failure requiring lifelong dialysis and/or death. I do happen to be an internal medicine provider and can tell you the current treatment for lupus nephritis is very limited, though I am admittedly no expert on this. The potential market is a few billion dollars annually just in US market. The good news is voclosporin is in under urgent review meaning its review schedule got pushed up due to positive phase 3 results and the target date is January 22, 2021. I did review their most recent summit presentation and the reported results are very encouraging. You may start looking around and see that volclosporin got shot down for dry eye recently, fear not. They are just searching for off label uses. They also have been testing its efficacy against covid. 

Now, that is all fine and dandy. And Ive been seeing pharm companies rocket on news like this, G L S I anyone? This kind of news triggers immediate and enormous buying, that much is irrefutable. But the pharm game is for sure a casino. In fact I just got burned putting my hand a little too close to O D T. A few pieces of news are gravitating me closer to this company though. First, AUPH leased a 17k square feet manufacturing site 20 miles from the CDC about three months ago. That would suggest they are preparing for rapid uptake in production very soon. Second, they recently bolstered an agreement with Lonza in Switzerland to also prep for huge production in the next few years. Lastly, they hired Peter Greenleaf as CEO of the company. Greenleaf is an artist at pharmaceutical company buy outs (which I see happening in 2021 possibly assuming flagship approval). All of this has me caught up in the possibilities of Christmas in January. 

TLDR:  AUPH 2/19 $17c x10, 200 shares at $14.08. Fireworks at end of January 2021. Plan: sell it all the second it rockets. 

Thank you for your time.

Title: A recap on $MT ArcelorMittal's recent history
#  Summary

An attractive alternative in a cheap industry.

Reasonable debt structure under the hands of debt-conscious management.

Interesting valuation that offers protection even for depressed cycle performance.

# Why Steel

As of the end of May 2020, steel, together with banks, O&amp;G drilling, some insurance businesses and fertilizers, is one of the cheapest industries in the market. Its performance in the last year has been negative, losing 20% of its market value.

The steel industry is trading at 10x earnings, a 20% discount to its book value and 6x 2019 EBITDA or 10x its 2020-21 estimated EBITDA.

The 20 largest steel companies as of that date are listed below. As we can see, there are significant differences in historical growth, margins, return on capital and current valuation, as measured by EV-to-EBITDA-LTM.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/43uy1uarxj561.png?width=536&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=483cec74627cf8da0b7c2fb02160534335b13bf4

 

ArcelorMittal seems to be the cheapest company in terms of EV multiple to LTMs EBITDA, which was the main reason to start looking into this company. Besides, it is clearly an industry leader able to capitalise into the consolidation that a crisis like the present one might bring.

## Steel industry snapshot

The steel industry is not particularly profitable. There can be particularly good years, but the bulk of the returns on capital are going to be in a 5-15% range, and they can be volatile from one year to another. The main driver of return on capital is margin, rather than turnover on capital.

The ROCE of the industry, represented by those 20 largest companies (and MT following a similar path in the last 15 years), was clearly in a negative trend until 2010, when it reached less than 5%, and then had a gradual recovery until 2019, when it reached 15% just before the COVID induced crisis on production first and on demand afterwards.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nylqu1rvxj561.png?width=442&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a0c13d3e3ab68b14d46077976c90ac2ffe984a0

 

MT is clearly not the best performer, especially with regard to EBITDA margin, but is able to keep up with its return on capital because is more efficient in turnover and in the control of maintenance capital expenditures.

Steel production is a certainly a complicated business:

* It is close to a perfect commodity for many segments of the finished product. Besides, no matter how old is the article you read on steel or on what country, excess of capacity is always the main concern. Overinvestment and overcapacity cycles have developed in Europe and USA in the 18th and 19th centuries, and more recently in China. When overcapacity has been created, producers tend to demand protection from their governments, which only makes the problem persist, creating incentives to perpetuate it.
* Cost production curve is almost flat, especially from $400-450 per ton. Cheaper producers are based in CIS, which is attributed ([McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Metals%20and%20Mining/Our%20Insights/The%20current%20capacity%20shake%20up%20in%20steel%20and%20how%20the%20industry%20is%20adapting/The-current-capacity-shake-up-in-steel-and-how-the-industry-is-adapting.ashx)) to low-cost captive raw materials access, a key reason for differences in cost of production per ton.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t10xiuyxxj561.png?width=475&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=284fdd0d429a77d29abef168420cc97a45beb13c

 

* The main steel consumers - auto and construction - are themselves very cyclical, so steel demand is cyclical by nature. This adds volatility in the output volumes and prices.
* The business is capital-intensive. It is estimated that [the average investment](https://www.steelonthenet.com/capital-investment-costs.html) per ton of raw steel production is $250-300. Since the [OCDE estimates](https://www.oecd.org/industry/ind/recent-developments-steelmaking-capacity-2019.pdf) that global capacity as of end of 2018 was 2,234M tons, that means the total invested capital is c. $650 billion, and that is only in basic raw steel production.
* Gains in productivity from technology are not huge, but they can be critical. This is an old industry, and while new little changes happen constantly, there have not been big game-changer technologies that have made all previous invested capital obsolete. There are two main production technologies that are selected based on the development of the producer country. When there is enough development, there is enough scrap product that can be re-melted using EAF, which is cheaper, cleaner and more efficient than BOF, which the classic technology used when iron ore needs to be used to produce raw steel.
* The input costs - iron ore, energy either in the form of coke coal, electricity or natural gas, scrap and different alloys, etc. - are all also volatile and subject to their own independent cycles, and can suffer from local imbalances that add to global cycles.
* The industry, many times voluntarily, is the focus of political intervention, regulation and protectionism practices that make management of steel companies even harder.

My view is that there is no way I will be able to have a view on what will be the short-, medium- or long-term evolution of steel prices, production, input prices, etc. Everything is too volatile and too fragmented to think of any investment in MT based on a reasonable estimate of the basic economic parameters for the industry.

On the other side of its sheer complexity, there is some inherent stability to steel. It is a product that will not disappear in the foreseeable future, as it is an essential product for everyday life products, and the range of uses and applications is enormous.

Therefore, my purpose will not be to make a guess on future steel price or future cost input prices. I find that impossible for my limited experience. My purpose will be to determine what is an average low point in the industry cycle and to build from there what could be a conservative valuation of the company.

## A recap on ArcelorMittal's recent history

Mr. Mittal started his own business history in Indonesia in 1975 when he changed his fathers plan to sell an unnecessary land plot and decided to build a steel plant on the site. Later, he bought a plant in Mexico that the government had built for more than $2 billion but that was losing money year after year. The next big one was in Kazakhstan. In 1997, the family floated a 20% stake in part of the international steel business and kept the Indian and the Kazakh business within the family.

From the public platform, they made the first step in the US in 1998 with the acquisition of Inland Steel. By then, they controlled 2% of world steel production.

With the start of the century, the Chinese expansion brought excellent years for the industry, coupled with a consolidation effort in which Mr. Mittal had a clear leading role. Finally, the steel industry was putting more focus on profitability rather than volume.

According to this [study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jsc.812) done in 2008, the strategies pursued by different steel companies to survive and grow in what certainly is a difficult industry can be grouped into eight different categories, from capacity growth with competitive acquisitions and JVs to location strategies, vertical integration, niche focus, etc.

According to the analysis, Mr. Mittal showed in the company's ascent to the global steel pinnacle that it was possible to be active in most of those strategies at the same time. He picked a mixture of strategic (meaning expensive) acquisitions mixed with discounter strategies by picking near-to-bankrupt steel companies at bargain prices. The only strategy he did not seem to exercise was the joint venture route.

The company's expansion to become the world steel leader reached its peak with the $34 billion deal for the control of Arcelor, the second-largest global producer coming from the French historical Usinor.

It was like mixing water and oil. Arcelor - representing the engineering tradition with its high-end product range, heavy old-school management structures and global planning departments, so full of history and know-how as well as costs and lack of productivity - having to be merged with the localist, low-end cheap steel producer with no apparent organization other than Mr. Mittal jumping from one bargain to another.

The resulting 130-million-ton steel giant, with 10% of global steel production, was about to face the toughest test from the global financing crisis that started in April 2007 and exploded in 2008, just a few months after Mr. Mittal became MTs CEO. By the closing of 2007, the year the merger took place, the company had $147 billion in assets and $34 billion in financial debt and $62 billion in equity.

As the crisis hit, shareholders and investors realized that valuations had been pushed up in the pre-crisis years. In addition to the global financial crisis, the steel sector would have to deal with a huge problem: the transition from a Chinese demand-driven market into a Chinese oversupply-driven market.

The company would reach its lowest point in 2015-16 with 20% of 2007s EBITDA, 50% of the starting equity and only 10% of the initial market capitalization. The end of 2016 left behind a period of write-offs, lay-offs, asset selloffs, capital increases, debt restructuring, etc.

Mr. Mittal and MT survived the financial crisis and the Chinese oversupply cycle that had driven EBITDA margin from more than $200 per ton in 2008 to less than $50 per ton in 2016, while going through a $20 billion deleveraging process just after the integration with of an old-school elephant as Arcelor.

For Mr. Mittal, that restructuring process just after going from the distressed opportunistic buyer he had always been to a top-price cycle-peak buyer of one of the biggest targets must have been an experience as enlightening as painful.

## The Company Today

MT is the worlds leading integrated steel and mining company. Its strengths focus in global scale and scope, technical capabilities, and a diverse portfolio of steel and related businesses, one of which is mining.

The company is the largest steel producer in the Americas, Africa and Europe and is the fifth largest steel producer in the CIS region. ArcelorMittal has steel-making operations in 18 countries on four continents, including 46 integrated and mini-mill steel-making facilities.

MT has approximately 191,000 employees and 130 million tons of steel products production capacity. Approximately 37% of its crude steel is produced in the Americas, 49% in Europe and 14% in other countries, such as Kazakhstan, South Africa and Ukraine.

The company produces a broad range of high-quality finished and semi-finished steel products and sells them in local markets through its centralized marketing organization to a diverse range of customers in the automotive, appliance, engineering, construction and machinery industries across 160 countries.

MT has a leading market share in its core markets in the automotive steel business and is a leader in the fast-growing advanced high-strength steels segment. In 2016, ArcelorMittal introduced a new generation of advanced high-strength steels, including new press hardenable steels and martensitic steels. In 2017, the company launched the second generation of its electrical steels that play a central role in the construction of electric motors.

MTs mining operations are integrated with its global steel-making facilities and are important producers of iron ore and coal. In 2019, approximately 52% of ArcelorMittals iron ore requirements and approximately 12% of its PCI and coal requirements came from them, and it is also a significant producer of coke, satisfying 95% of its coke needs through its own production facilities.

Its production sites have good access to shipping facilities, including through its owned, or partially owned, 15 deep-water port facilities and linked railway sidings. The company has its own downstream steel distribution business, primarily run through its Europe segment.

It seems like MT has a good business set-up that it has taken time to create and develop. This is a truly global diversified footprint steel producer with the correct links and bonds to the top global steel consumers in most of the geographical markets it operates.

# ArcelorMittal KPIs

What I think are the companys KPIs are summarized in the following table.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y05x5b76yj561.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86ca9ebcba1b626bfe4926fe2a0534dbe773d953

As we can see, **production capacity** has been slowly reducing from 130 million tons (metric) after the merger of Arcelor and Mittal to the current **112 million tons**, despite the different punctual acquisitions made by the company in the US, India and Italy in 2014, 2018 and 2019.

Average **utilization** of installed capacity for the whole period has been **74.5%**, but we can see it has been higher than the average since 2015. Something similar happens with turnover, which on average has been 1.6x, but it has performed better since 2015.

**EBITDA** has averaged **$9.6 billion** equivalent to **10.8%** of revenues, or **$107 per ton**. EBITDA is quite volatile going as high as 18%, close to $200 per ton, and as low as 6%, or $50 per ton. In dollars per ton, it can perfectly double, like in 2010, or halve, like in 2019, from one year to another.

A 5-6% EBITDA barely covers maintenance capex and debt interest service, so despite the fact that it looks positive, it is the very minimum to keep this company, and probably any other steel company, alive.

McKinsey estimates that the EBITDA margin required for long-term sustainability (cover variable, fixed and capital costs) is 17%, which compares with a 10% average in the 2004-16 period shown by McKinsey in the analysis linked to above.

In 2009, the decline in EBITDA margin was clearly caused by the fall in demand that led to a utilization rate of 55%, the lowest point in the series. But in 2015 and 2019, it had more to do with a fall in steel prices, not sufficiently compensated by a fall in input costs.

In line with EBITDA fluctuations, the normalized return on capital employed, ROCEn, moves significantly from one year to another. The average **ROCEn** is **9.2%**, but it can be twice that, as in 2007, or three times less, like in 2019. Normalized ROCE means EBITDA net of maintenance capex and constant tax rate over long-term assets and working capital net of goodwill. There is no effect from write-downs, impairments, etc., and no leverage effect. I also do not deduct changes in working capital, as they tend to put noise without changing the average.

How the business is valued by the market, I think, is probably best tracked by EV-to-EBITDA and EV-to-installed production capacity or to actual production in tons.

All three metrics tell a consistent story, as they have constantly decreased with time, especially since the 2008 crisis. In 2006-07, the **EV/EBITDA** was at **10x-12x**, and in the last five years, the range has been **4x-6x**. EV per installed steel production capacity was c. $1.650 per ton in 2007 and is now at $290 per ton, close to 6 times less. Same thing if we look at EV per ton of produced steel.

What is interesting is that the average EBITDA per ton in 2017-19 (to smooth out the low figure of 2019) is 50% of the maximum reached in 2007, while the EV per installed production capacity has divided almost by 6x. In other words, the valuation of the business, before debt is considered, has fallen almost 3 times more than the actual fall in its margin capacity.

## Normalized valuation estimate

For this valuation estimate:

* I will use 2019 **revenues of $77.7 billion** that come from 86 million tons of steel shipments at an average price of $928 per ton. To put this figure in perspective, the amount of steel sold is at the 40th percentile of last 14 years, while selling price per ton is at the 30th percentile. The normalized revenue figure should probably be higher, but since 2020 will be certainly lower, I think it is more prudent to use that reference.
* I will use the average **EBITDA margin** for the whole period of 14 years, which comes out at 10.8% rounded down to **10%**.
* I will use a **4% maintenance capex rate**, also in line with the historical average and equivalent to **$3.1 billion p.a**.
* With those assumptions, **normalized EBITDA** comes out to **$7.77 billion** p.a. and normalized **FCF** comes out to **$3.95 billion** p.a.

At current market values, those normalized figures imply a **3.2x EV-to-EBITDAn** and a **6.3x EV-to-FCFn**. A 6.3x multiple on FCFn implies a **15.9% unlevered FCFn yield** for us, the investors.

Looking at it from another perspective, applying a 10x multiple to FCFn, the resulting EV is $39.5 billion that net of debt, pensions, cash and JVs (with a 30% haircut), which implies a **$25 billion equity value** equivalent to **$20.6** per share, already taking into account the last capital increase and the deferred conversion of recently issued mandatorily convertible notes (at minimum conversion price).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 I think MT offers an interesting enough risk-reward opportunity to invest in.

It lacks any hype due to a number of factors right now but based on projected financials, revenue is slated to grow 10 fold in next 5 years. It is not like many other SP4CS who dont have current revenue and customers. Check below how i plan to make 10-15X on this company by 2024 just using common stock and warrants.

**Valuation**

As per investor presentation ([https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1776909/000121390020021307/ea125257ex99-2\_software.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1776909/000121390020021307/ea125257ex99-2_software.htm))

Company boasts of 4.7X Revenue multiple of 2021 revenue which is nearly half of Netflix and Roku. The SP4C merger is valued at $515 M.

Revenue growth rate is north of 70% currently and will come down to 30% by 2025 ( at 10X current revenue )

**Latest quarterly results**

[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201112006054/en/CuriosityStream-Announces-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201112006054/en/CuriosityStream-Announces-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results)

Company strikes a deal with Tata Sky in India that will introduce it to 20 million viewers. Company plans to use a combination of legacy players and its online signup to drive renevue growth.

Revenue of $8.7 million, up from $4.8 million in the third quarter of 2019;

Total paying subscribers of approximately 13 million, up 108% year-over-year;

Gross margin increased 200 basis points year-over-year to 61%;

Operating loss was $(6.8) million compared to operating loss of $(10.1) million in the third quarter of 2019;

EBITDA was loss of $(6.7) million compared to EBITDA loss of $(10.0) million in the third quarter of 2019;

**Takeaways from interview**

with John Hendriks ([https://kvgo.com/ab/curiositystream-november-2020](https://kvgo.com/ab/curiositystream-november-2020))

Low budget production. CI spends 20X lesser on their programming compared to famous OTT names.

Business is profitable at $20 per year.

John said that he wanted to build a sustainable business and revenue before going public. Company is showing good metrics since 2019.

Why Netflix or some other platform wont kill it? Because they must focus on expensive programming to justify their subscription fees. CI will only stay factual programming destination and that differentiation matters.

Why cant existing documentaty channels just run a OTT service?

Same problem as legacy car companies. They have licensing and distribution arrangements which prevents them from doing their own thing freely. They cant kill this cash cow and try something from scratch if the impression that i got from the interview.

Number of upcoming factual entertainment titles will be 36 X times others. (12000 compared to 300 - 400 ) for OTT rivals.

**Opportunity**

Assuming a 4.7X multiple to one year forward revenue will be applied in future too.

Then CI should be valued at 1.8 B in 2024. \[3.9 M ( 2025 revenue) \* 4.7 = 1.8 B\]

But in practice, at this level it will be a bigger and more visible name in markets and should attract a multiple similiar to other OTT players of around 7 - 8 X taking its valuation to 3 B.

So the stock price could be 4 - 6 times of current $10 a share.

**With Commons**

As discussed above, with common stock of company, there is a**4X - 6X opportunity by 2024**.

**With Warrants**

Warrants are very cheap at $1.2. Warrants can be called for excercise when common stock price hits $18. So if you hold warrants till then, they can go from $1.2 to about $6.5 ( $18 - 11.5 strike price ) Thats a 5X return. If proceeds are invested again into common stock and the target remains same at $40 - $60, it could be a further 2X - 3X . So overall**10X - 15X by 2024**.

**My positions**:

I have  invested in CURIW warrants. As said before all above was just for fun. Run this through a qualified professional before getting serious. Numbers could be totally wrong as this is a hobby and i havent done hard work required to get them right. Also its a young company and some would say their content is worse than free youtube stuff. I also have a subscription from them.

Discovery announced recently that it will start its Discovery + streaming service with Verizon. No idea how that changes the prospects of CI.

Title: Why am I bullish for the year of 2021
Guys, 2021 is coming and I am really bullish because according according to the Chinese Zodiac, 2021 is the year of the Ox (see link below for my DD). No need to worry guys, seems like we have our stars aligned. It's gonna be a bullish year ahead. PLTR 400 end of 2021

Title: Possibility to do a 100% increase with an European stock.
Hello dear Retards,



Here a DD for you about Solution 30 $S30, this is a European company specialized in solutions for new technologies. Mainly they offers a service to install new materials in companies by technicians of there company. This company has been an incredible success in 15 years, with insane growth !



Introduced on the open market in 2005 for 4.5 million . In July 2020, capitalization was in the  1.4 billion range.



Between splits and dilutions, the stock made a good 140 baggers.



Solutions 30 recorded third-quarter revenues of 212.6 million euros, up 28.6%, and up 24% like-for-like. For the first nine months of the year, the company's sales totaled 576.3 million euros, up 19.1%, with organic growth of 12.7%



But the company has been attacked by Muddy Waters, it seems they have realised a false report of a hundred pages circulating in the square, a report that seeks to demonstrate troubled links between the company and organized crime in Italy.



Last week the company asked to suspend its quotation in order to take time to respond to these accusations. But yesterday the company asked to get back in quotation, and they have launched a counter attack :



https://www.solutions30.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/S30-ANSWER-12-20-EN-VD-1.pdf



If this is true, the stock could go back from 9.5 to 19 in few days.

My position 945 at 9.18 the stock.

Title: New PLTR Contract
 *Palantir has some new contracts coming up:*

According to the job postings on Allianz's website they have 4 **new** jobs where in the job description they say "Some experience of the **Palantir Foundry platform** a bonus."

You can search for "Palantir" in the search bar on their careers page and see the primary source [https://jobs.allianz.com/sap/bc/bsp/sap/zhcmx\_erc\_ui\_ex/desktop.html#/SEARCH/](https://jobs.allianz.com/sap/bc/bsp/sap/zhcmx_erc_ui_ex/desktop.html#/SEARCH/)

*Who is Allianz:*

" Allianz is a European [multinational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation) [financial services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_service) company headquartered in [Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich), Germany. Its core businesses are insurance and [asset management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_management).

This seems to be a new and large customer for Palantir that they have not publicly stated they are doing business with. Allianz does \~143B in revenue a year and they are not a govt contract.

Title: VRM - Why not drive to the moon?
Listen up cucks.

Someone posted their [DD](https://amp.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k95qm7/going_vroom_on_vrm/) a week ago and I won't repeat that post. Since then, VROOM has [acquired Carstory](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/vroom-vrm-carstory-acquisition) which I believe puts the company back on track to grow in the mid term.

Vroom fucked up when the pandemic hit by shrinking their inventory, turns out these poor autists actually demanded more cars, Vroom lost money and has been tanking since. This acquisition is a sign of confidence and a testament to their data-driven approach for the future.

The share price has double bottomed and seems to have begun a reversal.

Get on the bandwagon or train or car or whatever the fuck they sell. VROOM VROOM motherfuckers. 

50C 16/4/2021

Title: SONO. Cant think of anything that could stop this run.
So someone else already mentioned that Sonos is on the run after signing a deal with Legrand today. That happened 1h before market close, why does it matter? Well most traders start closing their positions around 3pm, not opening the new ones. I believe that we will have a massive delayed reaction tomorrow, it only popping up 8% today (those who trade mid caps know thats very minuscule run on such news). SONO cap is 2B and average trading volume is 4.5mil. Today volume was 8.5mil which isnt too impressive (after earnings it ran 30% on 44mil vol). 

On top of that, technicals (yes I know Ill be shamed) adding up nicely, its above all the moving averages, on a clear upwards trend and has cleared previous resistance during daytime trading. 

I know us lot on here love short squeezes, but Sonos short position is only 5% of stocks float. In this particular situation its actually a good thing since after crushing earnings and now adding a subscription service they are progressing to tendie town. No shorts means very few doubters. Very few doubters mean we are going to have a lovely uptrend without much resistance. Not even mentioning that the stock is trading in less than 2x sales. Amazing bargain even after a great month. 

All four newest analyst ratings that came out on 11/19 and 10/15 are a Buy. After todays catalyst, which is a major financial event for this company, we should hear  about more upgrades within a week or so. At least thats what I noticed analysts like to do... 

Final point Id like to make is that this play is not dependent on Covid news. Its neither stay at home or reopening play. Why is that great? It is not dependent on general market whims and the run should not be spoiled by some odd Covid news.

Title: Index rebalancing. Do not be long this Friday.
This week will see the inclusion of $TSLA into the SNP. Typically how this works is when a stock is added to the index, another company comes out. The market cap of the new company is usually larger than the exiting one. Since the S&amp;P 500 index is market cap weighted, the weightings of all the other stocks need to come down to make room for the new company.

**Tesla will enter the SNP as the 7th largest stock.** This has never occurred before. 

This means that an absolutely massive amount of equity, $50 Billion +, has to be sold to make room for it.

The table below shows the current weighting of the largest SNP stocks and amount of equity to be sold, with the largest being $AAPL.

 [https://imgur.com/gallery/qxtcvLu](https://imgur.com/gallery/qxtcvLu)

The chart below shows the DOM for $AAPL as of yesterday 14:20. The COB is the current order book with the red areas resting limit orders currently in the market. (This information is typically not available to retail, however you all have become dear to my heart) 

 [https://imgur.com/gallery/bCaBMbB](https://imgur.com/gallery/bCaBMbB)

Notice the large resting orders of big traders at 128, which is about where the stock stopped yesterday. Above that 129, and then an absolutely huge order at 130.

**Big institutions are getting out as everyone is FOMO'ing in.**

They will support this market into Friday and buy any small dips in order to keep the buying going whilst they get out. 

As of yesterday afternoon I am mostly short with my only long positions $PSTH, and some Uranium and energy.  Do not trade your money into the hands of these players before the market drops, you can always get back in next week, the market won't run away from you in 3 days.

Positions:

* $BRKB Long Put March 21 exp; 
* $AAPL Long Put Friday exp; 
* $ERX Long Call '22 exp; 
* $URA Long Call June '21 exp; 
* $PSTH Long Call Jun 18'21 30 (gang gang); 
* Long equity: $BTWN, $REMX, $UGL; 
* Short equity: $WKHS

Title: LAC, yet another bull run into 2021
Alright, tards, you may remember the Lithium Americas Company (LAC) because of a nice buy the rumour &amp; sell the news moment around Teslas Battery Day this September.

People thought Tesla would flat out buy LAC and secure the largest future lithium mine on US soil, but then got disappointed when that didnt happen (and Battery Day was a flop).

What does lithium have in common with tendies? Batteries need lithium, Tesla needs batteries. Following so far? Good.

LAC popped 8% today and I think it has room to grow.

The reality is:

* LAC still owns the Thacker Pass, **one of the largest lithium repositories on the planet**, not **200 miles away from Tesla GigaFactory**.
* US will become a **net exporter of lithium** with that mine
* Lithium extraction in that mine will be **carbon neutral**. If you dont care about that, Elon does care.
* Were rotating back into solar again, and solar needs batteries. Look how TAN did today (spoiler - fucking ETF popped 8%).
* Tesla buying LAC is not off the table. 

LAC is ready for another run up. Its trading almost entirely off technicals, its fucking boring. But - it gives you a fine entry point. It literally bottoms out the RSI, crosses the MACD and bounces off support levels and SMAs. 

Thacker Pass website: [https://www.lithiumamericas.com/thacker-pass/](https://www.lithiumamericas.com/thacker-pass/)

Crayon drawings for proof and entertainment. Notice the green dashed that show how bull run starts align with oversold conditions. We started a new run by bounding 8% from $9 and ending the day around $9.71.

Positions: 1000 shares at $9, since yesterday.   
Disclaimer: Im no financial advisor, buy LAC or dont, I dont care.  
Rocket emoji: none, because the bot doesn't like it anymore.

Title: TLRY was ONCE a $150 stock
With the Upcoming Potential merger with APHA. TRLY will be receiving in this deal . APHA will be dominating . We know how tiny TLRY compared to other giants like CGC. 

Anyways theres 2 big things that need to happen. 
The merger with APHA +5 dollars
The Senate runoff going to dems. +5.

If these events happen seemlessly TLRY will be around $20-$23/share early 2021. 

Or if it doesnt happen my wife will divorce me and marry her boyfriend.

Title: NESTLE long term investment
The Swiss company is focusing its business on climate protection and higher profitability.

Climate protection cannot wait. Food giant Nestle has set itself tight targets. By 2050, the Swiss company wants to achieve "green zero," meaning that its entire business should be climate-neutral. This goes along the entire supply chain. Starting with arable farming, which is being converted to soil-conserving production, and extending to the 800 Nestle sites that use green electricity. In addition, 200 million trees are planted and renaturation is promoted. In five years, all packaging should be recyclable or reusable. Nestle is investing 3.2 billion Swiss francs in this. The stock market reacted cautiously. The Swiss share price even slipped below the 100-franc mark. Investors fear that Nestle will not be able to offset the investment with efficiency gains as planned.

efficiency gains as planned. This would ultimately reduce profits. The concern seems exaggerated. The issue of sustainability is becoming increasingly important, and good money can be earned with healthy food. Nestle grows through innovations and acquisitions. Anything that is not profitable is sold, as was the case with the rice porridge business in China. The water business in North America is also up for sale. New areas such as vegan and vegetarian products and the Health Science division with products to support health are achieving double-digit growth rates. Most recently, Aimmune, a US company developing therapies for food allergies, was acquired. The deal, which is the biggest of the year so far, will certainly not be the last. The Swiss are making faster than expected progress 

faster than expected. In the first nine months of the year, adjusted sales rose 3.5 percent to 61.9 billion Swiss francs. The strong coffee business, which accounts for about a quarter of total sales, and rising online revenues more than offset declining restaurant sales. For the full year, Nestle is now confident of achieving organic growth of around three percent. The analysts at Berenberg have included Nestle in their list of top picks from the sustainability sector. They not only trust the Swiss to achieve a green zero. They also see a price potential of up to 122 francs.

**TLDR:  100c 12/2021**

Title: If there's one thing I know, it's vans.
Alright, listen up. 

We are all autistic in some way, right? Well I'm  for cars and as such I am basically the same level of autism as horse girls. Anyone else into cars knows what I'm talking about. Lazer focus. 

Anyway it's well known that Canoo is about reveal a new bangbus xl  on Thursday. Some people don't seem to care about it that much. Do you know who will care about it? FUCKING EVERYONE. 

[if you take a trip down to canoo's Instagram](https://instagram.com/canoo?igshid=hwa85djv8uay) you'll see some recent posts teasing the van. No big deal, right? Look closer at the people interacting with the brand *frequently* and not letting too much go. Im talking people like:

[Bobby from queer eye ](https://instagram.com/bobby?igshid=mvc506ixupce) (different from a   dont worry) with 2.8 million subs
[this dude with 1.2m followers who is into #van life](https://instagram.com/everchanginghorizon?igshid=uetd3spahkxp) he's probably that guy that keeps picking your wife up for her private surfing lessons. 

And most importantly for the car nerds:

[Johnny lieberman from motortrend](https://instagram.com/jonnylieberman?igshi
d=i7toqecs807z)
[the founder of rotiform - the same company that sponsors ken block](https://instagram.com/imsoovertheinternet?igshid=xzyk2u47scwj)
[bisimoto](https://instagram.com/bisimoto?igshid=vnys0egfp08g) the mad man thats been super into building [insane EV creations like this porsche 935](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.motortrend.com/news/bisimoto-1984-porsche-935-ev/amp/), and this [batshit Honda odyssey with 1000hp](https://youtu.be/u0l6QMEiOdE) . He cut his teeth in Hondas but most recently he signed a deal with Hyundai. 

Hyundai, you know, what you wish you could afford. Bisimoto has been building performamce cars for them. Anyway Hyundai is growing massively right now [and is an investor in canoo](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). Hyundai is even revealing their new ioniq 5 EV crossover this week, maybe even with some tech from canoo. Outsourcing and buying trademarks is common in the auto industry (flexfuel is a Koenigsegg patent for example and mag ride is GM)

But back to bisi. Whats the connection? I think all of these influencers are going to show off the new bangbus 2.0 in their own ways. Theres going to be a vanLIFE version that TRANSCENDS THE EV AND CAR INDUSTRY.... im talking the Becky industry. And maybe to the levels only apple has seen because the only thing that gets a girl fired up more than an iphone is being able to use that iPhone to post about the van life (something we on wsb have lots of experience in already, I am sure). Nothing as romantic as showering at the YMCA and pissing in an empty milk jug so you can watch the stars on a road you aren't 100% certain. You can sleep on. Take it from me; I've owned porsches, tuner cars, offroad rigs, and luxury cars. The one that has easily gotten the most love from everyone is my 1994 Mitsubishi delica

Now what about bisimoto? Well I garauntee he is going to show off a 1000hp canoo van race car. If you take a look at their gram you'll see some promos involving a race car driver. Its going to roll on rotiforms like the 2013 stance scene (if you dont get that reference be thankful). Recently on the Smoking Tire Podcast bisimoto kept getting giddy about future plans he had that he couldn't talk about that were supposedly mental. I bet these are the plans. 


TL;DR Canoo is about to go on a marketing frenzy and become famous among the youth by the end of the week. Get in now before your sister shows you a picture of one and asks if you've ever seen it while HC  AC is sitting at 60 a share

Common shares. Barely.

Title: Alright check this shit out.
LAC (lithium of americas corp) has 100% ownership of the thacker pass located in Nevada. Thacker pass is supposed to be one of the largest Lithium reserves in the United States and will begin construction in 2021. Teslas giga factory is located roughly 200 miles from this location. What do I think is going to happen? LAC will land a contract with Tesla in the next 6 months and moon.  Long calls on LAC

Hows that for some DD?

Title: Im About To Buy A Stock Based Off a 12 Year Olds DD
In case you havent seen this post from yesterday over on r/pennystocks


https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/kddj2c/my_12_year_old_son_asked_for_100_shares_of_mndo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

This kids dad had him write out a DD for why his dad should buy him 100 shares of this stock for Christmas.

The thing is ... it made more sense than 99% of the decisions I see from you retards and degenerates on this sub. 

The fact that it has a nearly 10% annual dividend and it has stayed consistent in both price (avg 2.25) and dividend(avg about 10%) for a good part of the last decade only makes it that much more appealing.

Personally, Im fuckin buying.

Title: How bullish 0% interest rate world really is - Answer: VERY BULLISH
Good evening legends,

The following post will be brief. This post will setup my framework and over the next few days I'm going to be posting my DDs on the stocks I've invested in if there is interest.

# TLDR: I am FULLY SENDING IT - below is WHY.

**Aphorism 1:** "STONKS only go up" - WSB legends

* I am a true believer of things improving over time. My plays are stocks and leaps due to tax advantages and frankly the humility that came along with trying to time the top/bottom and failing on multiple occasions.

**Aphorism 2:** "History doesn't repeat itself but it often rhymes." - Mark Twain

* What are the top 3 countries with the lowest interest rates?
   * Switzerland: maintained the same interest rate for the last five years. Annualized return of EWL ETF over those 5 years? 10% with 61% total return.
   * Denmark: maintained 0% to negative \~1% interest rate for the last five years. Annualized return of EDEN ETF over those 5 years? 12.78% with 82.43% total return.
   * Japan: has been fucked for a long time, everybody knows it. EVENTHOUGH FUCKED - annualized return of EWJ over the past 5 years? 8.22% with 48.46% total return.
* The Federal Reserve indicates it will not raise rates for years. It will leave the interest rates around 0% until 2023. What does this mean? Long equity, any equity and if you want to short something don't short fucking TESLA short BANKS. My favorite bank to short is Goldman Sachs, because I like Bernard Baruch not a retard that calls himself DJ Sol.

**Aphorism 3:** "The odds are either 100% or 0%, and we just don't know which." - one of my legendary friends

* The fundamental risk at the moment is, the FED's statement of keeping interest rates low is not binding. I am betting that they will stay at 0% but again the statement is NOT BINDING.

Title: Why $SPCE is gonna rocket
[spce to the moon](https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/virgin-galactic-wall-street-favorite-despite-rocket-snafu)

Yes theyre rocket failed but wall street professionals still like it wonder why? Virgin galatic showed their proof of concept in their latest flight attempt. Instead of having a rocket explosion (would of been way cooler) they saved their entire rocket not even wasting their fuel in it over wifi. 

This means they due for a another attempt soon. How soon? I hope within the month assuming that is the only problem. Much like me galatic is still a virgin in space but have showed benefits of space flight using their take on it. And as soon as this announcement comes another big run up will happen. Now with all that said wall street likes spce because of this and will continue buying this dip so get in now and wait till we go to the moon!

Title: Bull Case for Peter Thiel Backed Company Luminar (LAZR) - Next potential TSLA. 
Brought to you by the retard who made $3 million off NVAX (look at my profile). I recently sold the majority of my NVAX shares and dumped all of that money into LAZR. 

For those who dont know LAZR is a company specializing in producing LiDAR technology for self-driving cars as opposed to the current standard model of cameras. LiDAR instead sends out a beams of laser light, and measures the return time as well as wavelength distortions in order to create an image of the landscape. 

EVEN ELON MUSK IS SCARED OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. He has actively responded to and denounced it, and I believe in doing so has made it clear that he sees it as a threat.

https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/22/anyone-relying-on-lidar-is-doomed-elon-musk-says/

Luminar has contracts with several car companies. It is supplying Volkswagen and Volvo with these sensors, with the first Audi vehicles (owned by VW) equipped with these sensors coming out in 2021 and Volvo in 22. They also have Daimler and Toyota.

https://www.media.volvocars.com/us/en-us/media/pressreleases/268323/next-generation-volvo-cars-to-be-powered-by-luminar-lidar-technology-for-safe-self-driving

https://www.wired.com/story/vw-audi-aid-luminar-lidar-self-driving/

https://www.autonews.com/mobility-report/daimler-invests-lidar-startup-luminar-bolster-self-driving-truck-effort

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170927005431/en/Toyota-Research-Institute-Partners-with-Luminar-on-Autonomous-Vehicle-Tech

It is also supplying Mobileye (a subsidiary of Intel) with sensors. Mobileye has a partnership with NIO to produce self-driving passenger cars in China:

https://newsroom.intel.com/news/mobileye-nio-partner-bring-level-4-autonomous-vehicles-consumers-china-beyond/


If you are bullish on any of the (Chinese) self-driving car stocks such as NIO, XPEV, etc. you should be bullish on this stock and LiDAR in general as they are using this exact technology in their vehicles.

https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-nio-autonomous-intel-idUKKBN1XG2H3


WHY LAZR OVER OTHER LiDAR stocks?

One reason I chose this stock was mainly because of the big dick youngest billionaire 25 year old CEO. Before you laugh let me explain. This kid is a genius. He dropped out of Stanford because he received a 100,000 grant to pursue this company. From who? Our favorite: Peter Thiel. He has since been backing this company and I know how much you retards love this guy. This guy himself literally invented a brand new microchip for his technology because the commercially available ones werent good enough. 

Buy the dip ASAP. It fell 20% today, consolidating from its massive 300% gain that its had the past three weeks following the SPAC deal. It is still up 120% since three weeks ago. As of writing this I cannot tell you when this reversal will start (hence I am long in shares), but once this starts going back up I doubt we will ever see numbers this low again. It is almost half its current value since 1 week ago, this stock is a steal at its current price. This is an incredible long term investment and will only skyrocket in the foreseeable next couple years during the Electric Vehicle takeover.

TLDR: Buy Peter Thiel backed company LAZR. It is at a huge discount rn and there may not be a better buying opportunity. It easily has the best technology compared to its competitors and already has contracts with Volvo, Volkswagen, Daimler, NIO, etc.

Title: [VLDR] There are No Flying Cars in Your Future, but Self Driving Cars are for Real. $30 by March 2021. Then we really   afterwards
Are you a fan of The Jetsons? No? You are not some old ass boomer and therefore, you dont even know what The Jetsons are?

Ok, fair enough. But chances are, you are probably retarded because you are wasting your time in this sub looking for tendies. And retarded people think the flying cars are coming (just like in The Jetsons).

But I hate to break it to you. The flying cars are not coming. Why? Because the popularity of this sub has turned most of the population quite retarded. No one is working in a garage somewhere working on a flying car. They are all watching Jim Cramer talking about autists and in turn, we are wasting time away in this sub for the next shitty stock that might make you tendies.

However, self driving cars are quite real. And today, we are going to look at the market leader in the technology that will allow us to get there.

**Self Driving Cars? How Real is This Shit?**

Oh, this shit is quite real. So real, in fact, you will hear about them often between now and the next 24 months. 

1. All the Boomer car companies want to be valued like tech stocks. So GM, Hyundai, Ford, VW, and you name them. They are all entering into some sort of partnership with tech companies that are making the tech that is required to make this a reality. (And it doesnt have to be full self driving. Any semi auto driving and driver assistance tech are high in demand) Call it a FOMO effect. The boomer car companies have been left behind by Tesla and other EV companies (in terms of investor excitement and stock valuation). So they dont want to be left behind in this trend. So they are all signing up and spooning each other with companies like NVDA, Intels Mobileye, Google, Baidu, etc.

2. The taxi industry as we know it, will be transformed once again. Why? Remember when Uber and Lyft disrupted the traditional taxi/cab industry by offering the same service using an App? I mean, who wants to walk outside and hail a cab (hoping to catch one) these days. No one, unless you are a boomer. Well, the same companies that disrupted the traditional taxi industry are motivated to disrupt it once again because of the on-going debate on whether Uber drivers should be classified as employees or contractors. Solution? Get rid of the drivers and make them all autonomous to make CEOs rich and drivers unemployed.

3. The tech is here and available. And the key technology is something called LiDAR and the software platform that operates it.

**What is LiDAR and why should I care?**

Think of LiDAR as an eye of the self-driving vehicle providing it a 360 degree view. Just like a car that is driven and operated by a human being, a self driving car will need to figure out how to operate the vehicle thru traffic, potholes, trees and other obstacles on the road. Well, thats what the LiDAR technology provides. It serves as the eye for the self driving cars so it can move in and out of the traffic and get its passengers from Point A to Point B.

**Ok, LiDAR is like an eye. But why should I care about Velodyne?**

Well, Velodyne is the undisputed leader in this field and right now, they have the backers (Ford, Baidu, Nikon, Hyundai, etc).

They are the established market leader, with first mover advantage. Per Needham, Velodyne is expected to own 60% of the market share of autonomous vehicle market by 2024. They have 300+ customers with $800 Million in contracted revenue thru 2024. Additionally, theres an opportunity to incrementally add 60%+ increase in revenue over the same time period.

With their entrenched existing customers, there is a high switching cost. So unlike LAZR (which just lost Intels Mobileye), their existing customer would not be able to easily switch their supplier or look for another supplier without incurring significant switching cost.

But the most important aspect of their competitive advantage in the LiDAR sensor market has to do with their pricing. When David Hall first participated in DARPA sponsored autonomous vehicle competition in 2005~, each LiDAR Sensor unit cost about $80,000. Today, Velodyne is able to sell similar LiDAR sensors between $100 - $600 per unit. No other competitor can offer a similarly competitive product at the same price range. 

Velodyne dominated this market for over 13 years. They have a broad product portfolio (not just LIDAR sensors) with global sales and mass scale manufacturing capabilities. They are not tied down to automotive market either as they currently expand to about 25+ new market segments.

Additionally, they can upsell to its existing costumers with their Vella Collision Warning System. This is Velodynes software solution to power their LiDAR products. They can offer automotive manufacturers with advanced capabilities including auto pilot, collision avoidance, pedestrian automotive emergency braking and more. Multiple automotive OEMs are in development on Velodynes ADAS projects with initial deliveries happening right now. There are no BS research turned production deals like LAZR. They have real revenue, real products and real customers. 

Today, only 25% of their revenue is generated from LiDAR related technology. 75% of the revenue comes from ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems), Robotics and Industrial Mapping, Shuttles, Smart City Delivery, etc.

**Ok. So they got cool stuff and real customers. But what about their growth prospects?**

Well, you greedy bastard. This companys growth aspects are primed to make you tendies over the next couple of years. In fact, this might be the kind of dream growth stock that you can bank on.

1. Revenue Growth: Velodynes projected revenue for 2020 is around $100 Million. They are expected to grow their revenue to $150 Million next year, $250 Million in 2022, $412 Million in 2023 and $684 Million in 2024. 

2. Earnings Growth: Velodyne is expected to incur losses of ($50 Million) this year. But they are expected to reduce this loss to ($8 Million) next year and be profitable from 2022 and forward. By 2024, they expect to be record EBITDA of $150 Million~.

3. Gross Margin: Velodynes gross margin on their LIDAR products is around 20% today. They expect to double this gross margin to 40% next year and continue to increase the margin from there.

4. Product Mix Trend for Revenue: Today, significant portion of Velodynes revenue comes from LIDAR and other automotive technology. But they plan to balance this out by increasing revenue from their software and license/subscription products going forward.

5. Amazons Zoox just launched a plan to start a robotaxi service in CA and NV by end of 2021 or early 2022 using Velodynes LIDAR sensors. BAIDU is expected to enter its own EV vehicles and they are investors of Velodyne and can certainly use many of the technologies (not just LIDAR) offered by VLDR. Nikon is using VLDRs LIDAR tech for its lineup of products (similar to iPhone 12 Pro using LiDAR) going forward. As a market leader in the LIDAR tech and also leader in pricing advantage with backers such as Hyundai, BAIDU, Ford, etc, this is just the beginning.

**TL;DR**

Conclusion:

1. They have far superior LIDAR product and they can sell it at much affordable price point. They have over 300+ customers and the customers cannot simply switch to another supplier due to high cost of switching.

2. Current market cap is around $ 4 Billion (give or take). In comparison, LAZRs market valuation is around $14 Billion. Never mind that LAZR has no real revenue (i.e. their recent filing indicates that all of their revenue is from interest income), lost Mobileye as customer only about a month after inking a deal, and they dont have bullshit research turned into production deals either. So the bottom line is that this stock is super cheap.

3. They will be profitable by 2022 and increase their revenue by almost seven folds by 2024. They are the undisputed leader with the right technology and the right backers/partners. Good news is only starting and for a change, its still not too late for you to get in.

Target Price: $30 by March 2021. After that, it moons.

Title: Avepoint - The Best Growth Opportunity in 2021
**What is Avepoint?**

AvePoint is the largest independent software vendor of SaaS solutions to migrate, manage and protect data in Microsoft 365. They are not just a Microsoft partner, they are **THE** Microsoft Partner. They have won the *MSFT Partner Of The Year* Award 5 times.

Founded in 2001 and still growing. They have adapted to all the changes seen in software and cloud computing flawlessly. Not many companies have the pliability to adapt to market and technological innovations over the course of 20 years. There arent too many 20-year-old technology companies around today, especially ones that are thriving and still innovating, outside of the giant household names.

Taken from their investor presentation: [Agility and Invention](https://i.imgur.com/ThCEay8.png)

&gt; We have consistently developed first-to-market solutions  from the days of DocAve CD-ROMs and being the first SharePoint migration vendor, to being one of the first vendors to move our solutions onto Microsoft Cloud as IaaS/PaaS and then SaaS provider, to our recent Policies and Insights SaaS product that is the first to identify, prioritize and enforce actions to prevent the exposure of sensitive information in Microsoft 365.

**Flawless Growth and Financials**

Here's the dopesauce. [There are 212 public software companies and AvePoint is one of 5 that is growing at a rate of more than 25% revenue while maintaining a higher than 10% EBIT margin.](https://i.imgur.com/QQYIpRj.png) The others in this group are ZM, RNG, NOW, TEAM. Take a quick look at the year these companies are having based on their growth and the stay at home environment. Avepoint fits this exact script.

They already have a mega client base of 7 million customers. **25% of the Fortune 500 companies use Avepoint.**

AvePoints 7 million customers represent a 3% share of Microsofts 250 million 365 users. AvePoint believes it can get to 10% share and Microsoft will hit 500 million users in the future, good for 50 million AvePoint future customers.

(TAM) Total Addressable Market: $33 billion by 2022.

They did a subscription based conversion back in 2014 and according to their CEO Dr. Tianyi (TJ) Jiang, 70% of their yearly revenue is already spoken for, leaving tremendous upside for growth. [**They're already at 30%(!!!) YoY growth this year and looking to repeat that number in 2021.**](https://youtu.be/xD33VLw9ZOI?t=140)
They have no debt. Cash positive with $250M in reserves. EBIT margins of 10% as mentioned. Rare qualities in the SaaS sector. The company is well over the Rule of 40 (The Rule of 40 states that, at scale, a company's revenue growth rate plus profitability margin should be equal to or greater than 40%.). Another rare quality. This company fucks. 

**Valuation**

Avepoint will go public through a reverse merger with Apex Technologies in Q1 of 2021. This deal values Avepoint at $2B. In my estimation with currently market climates and demand for growth investing, **Avepoint is massively undervalued.**

A few of wall street's favorite growth SaaS company valuations:

Fastly (FSLY) - $10.6B Market Cap and $200M Revenue

Cloudflare (NET) - $25B Market Cap and $287M Revenue

Slack (WORK) - $24B Market Cap and $400M Revenue

Datadog (DDOG) - $31B Market Cap and $368M Revenue

Now compare this to Avepoint with it's $2B Market Cap and $150M Revenue. There's a huge valuation discrepancy based solely on what wall street investors are willing to pay for growth companies in the tech and stay and home sector especially with COVID. Avepoint has the potential to be a **5-10 bagger.**

**TL;DR** Avepoint is massively undervalued and has the potential to be a 5-10 bagger over the next year should it meet standard growth tech valuations alone. This combined with it's boosted cash on the back of going public and its already flawless financials makes it the perfect company to pocket now!

*Disclaimer*: I have 530 shares at $13 avg and 500 warrants at $3 avg and will continue to add $500 every week OR I may just yolo my entire life savings at it... haven't decided yet.

Title: The Next Elon
ALRIGHT RETARDS LETS GET DOWN TO BRASS TACKS

Some background info, Im currently a shitty dominos employee living the wagie life after dropping out of college and Im here to make some FUCKING MONEY

I went to a prestigious private high school and during my freshman year I had the privilege of talking with the current CEO of Luminar (LAZR) Austin Russel (he clutched our schools win for the world championships first robotics challenge) This is relevant because many people dont know much about what he actually does and they can only see the company website. I AM HERE TO TELL YOU THERE IS MORE! (Hes literally a genius engineer with big brain and lots of foresight)

When he was a senior in high school he was developing a lazer (yes, LAZR) that *transmits energy from a ground source, to a sattelite, and back to a target position on the ground.* This sounds crazy but I am 100% confident once Luminar starts rolling out their systems in 2022 he will begin to put this system he developed (and later perfected at his Stanford laboratory) into electric cars to eliminate the need for charging stations. I dont know the current scope of the technology he developed but I can speculate that it will eventually come into play in mobile devices as well.

TLDR I knew this dude in high school and I thought hed work for the government or something but it looks like hes coming to take the throne away from Elon in terms of innovative new technologies

Title: BBBY to $50/share?
Bull thesis: 

1) Aggressive, expanded share buybacks

2) Sale of part of its business to a private equity firm for an undisclosed sum - but probably based on multiples above the current share price.

3) One of the most shorted companies which can provide a mega pump sky high.

4) New loyalty cards program and membership for year round discounts.

5) Aggressive lease renegotiations with landlords resulting in rent reductions.

6) Massive restructuring towards e-commerce and inventory drawdowns.

Nasdaq only updates short interest 2x/month - the next update should be this week based on prior historical trends.

*Barron's article:*  

Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is rising early Tuesday, a day after it announced it would sell Cost Plus World Market, its last non-core brand.     

Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (ticker: BBBY) said that private-equity firm Kingswood        Capital Management was buying the store chain for an undisclosed        amount; the deal is expected to close before Bed Bath's fiscal year ends        in February. In addition, Bed Bath announced a new $150 million        accelerated share repurchase program. It will be added to the $225        million buyback plan launched in October, which it has largely        funded from noncore asset sales.     

The shares closed down in regular trading Monday, but are up 1.9% to $19.23        at recent check. Bed Bath has gained more than 9% year to date, rising        nearly six-fold from its lows in March.     

Analysts were largely happy with the news. Raymond James's Bobby        Griffin reiterated a Strong Buy rating and $26        price target on the shares. He writes that the sale dovetails well with        management's strategy to focus on its flagship brands, and calls        concerns that the lack of disclosure about the price is " shortsighted,"        given its strong balance sheet. "Accordingly, at this point, the        monetization of Cost Plus is not needed as a core part of the investment        thesis and is just extra capital for an incremental accelerated share        repurchase plan," he says.     

Robert W. Baird's Peter Benedict reiterated an        Outperform rating and $50 price target, writing that        following the sale, Bed Bath's "portfolio restructuring \[is\] seemingly        complete." He notes that some investors might have been disappointed        that the release didn't include any update for the third quarter, but        overall it was good news: "With a streamlined portfolio of assets and        strong balance sheet, Bed Bath has the focus and financial flexibility        to drive its business transformation over the next few years."     

Telsey Advisory Group's Joseph Feldman reiterated        an Outperform rating and $28 price target. He says the        sale will allow Bed Bath to focus on its four key categories: home,        beauty, wellness, and baby. "Looking ahead, the planned initiatives --        which target merchandising, pricing, stores, supply chain, digital, and        technology -- should result in a smaller, but more profitable Bed        Bath &amp; Beyond by 2023."

Solar stocks and EVs have been booming after Biden won the election, but the largest producer of clean energy in the US is only 10% higher than it's february highs.  


NextEra Energy (NEE) is is the largest producer of solar and wind energy and has plenty to benefit from a Biden administration:  
\- Recently acquired eIQ, an EV electrification company that determines how and when to pivot to electric vehicles for fleets

\- Helps lower emissions of natural gas companies by converting them and making them more efficient

\- Largest solar and wind farms in the world

\- Low IV premium cmpared to other solar stocks on the market  


\- Consistent growth in revenue and EPS 

This stock is a steady utilities company, but is best prepared to benefit from the Green Plan. Leaps 2 years out are only 2-3$ and shares are extremely low risk.

As states are desperate for revenue look for more and more of them to legalize sports betting, and DKNG is the market leader with projections of close to 50% market share in 2021. 

Disney says that sports wagering is a "key opportunity" and "important area of growth for the company". Guess who owns about 6% of DKNG? DIS. [ESPN + DKNG ='s many autists](https://www.casino.org/news/disney-says-sports-betting-can-boost-espn-streaming-service/). 

Sports ratings are down, Covid-19 still exists and it doesn't matter. [$936.1 million in autist money](https://www.lineups.com/betting/new-jersey-breaks-record-for-highest-sports-betting-handle-in-a-single-month/) is a record for NJ and they only have one hockey team. 

Upcoming events: NY bill, NBA season, NFL playoffs

It's been hovering around 50 for a couple of weeks now and looks like it's ready to breakout again and hopefully retest the ATH of around 64.

I'm in for a little over 5000 shares.

TL;DR  - politicians suck, dis owns 6%, people are betting on sports

Title: ZNGA to Jupiter and beyond
Ok retards, listen up, this ugly boi has long been neglected, spat on, pushed under the rug, dismissed as a smidge of dirty old piece of chewed gum. But NOW is the time to catch this pod *before* it gets launched into interstellar space.

Zynga has had what others might see as a rough season in a year where all tech/gaming/youronlinemom stocks have been gaining like motherfs. 

This sweaty underdog has been silently upgraded today by Wells Fargo:

[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/zynga-stock-gains-after-wells-fargo-upgrade-2020-12-15](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/zynga-stock-gains-after-wells-fargo-upgrade-2020-12-15)

**and** they just issued $750 million worth of convertible senior notes:

[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201214005408/en/Zynga-Inc.-Announces-Proposed-Private-Offering-of-750-Million-of-Convertible-Senior-Notes](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201214005408/en/Zynga-Inc.-Announces-Proposed-Private-Offering-of-750-Million-of-Convertible-Senior-Notes)

Zynga is obviously gearing up for this:

[https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/16/zynga-is-forming-a-new-studio-to-develop-a-star-wa/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/16/zynga-is-forming-a-new-studio-to-develop-a-star-wa/)

And 2021 is their year of break out as a leader of mobile games.

Positions: anything with a strike January and beyond. Helmet up and god speed, autists.

Title: Wecommerce is mooning, Ackman is an investor. $WE.V
2nd day post SPAC merger, the stock is up 35% today.

\~700 million dollar company.

Basically, they buy privately held SAAS companies that operate on the Shopify partners ecosystem.

Ackman gave them 40 mil as seed money.

The founder is a genius when it comes to tech companies. He's been buying/founding tech companies for about a decade. Has gone from dirt poor to being worth a half a billion dollars.

&amp;#x200B;

The company's revenues are growing fairly steadily, the new inflow of capital will probably be used to buy more businesses to add to their own ecosystem. They could potentially be bought out by SHOP in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

For those of you who can buy Canadian stocks, I think this'll probably keep flying.

&amp;#x200B;

I picked up 1000 shares.

Title: DD on hyln basically buy a shit ton of calls
No numbers here, just pure logic because its literally retarded that its at the price it is now

-large EV market to take part in 

-not much about hylns products being shitty, but theres plenty to suggest theyre good (carbon negative, cheaper, good news from partners)

Therefore hyln has good products for said market, meaning the potential for growth is huge. The market hasnt realized that yet, so hyln is undervalued. Numbers wont really prove me right or wrong as this is mostly speculation, but logically theres no reason to not speculate positively

Ill say it again for the retards in the back, Wall Street hasnt realized hylns potential yet, so its undervalued. BUY CALLS!!!!

Title: RKT Round 2, Day 4 of an 8 Day Bull Run
As some of you may have heard, RKT is starting its move again towards the $30+ of early September

With momentum growing and price range of $22 being held pretty solid, we can easily see RKT head way over $30 this time

The Day Chart for the MACD was just crossed and on average RKT's mini bull runs last approximately 8 days

today is day 4, and we still have 4 more days to do.

Im fully expecting this bull run to end next Monday and RKT to see green every day until then, and THEN the mini bear drawdown might trade sideways at that point

Look at the Day MACD cross and how many days it last, it hasnt been wrong yet

Positions: $63,000 worth of shares, 5 3/21 $30 Calls

Title: Grab your STEEL helmets boys. Next stop is the MOON!!
It's been a while since WSB has had a rocketship to YOLO their weekly paycheck into. I'm here to give you a legit DD on fucking STEEL. Yes, steel, the most boomer stock ever but who cares. While boomers are busy debating $ABNB prices and which EV is the next Tesla we're strapping in for another 10 bagger. After this one Cramer will be reading every DD live on TV.

If you missed out on all the big plays, get in now. Who gives a fuck, you may as well YOLO because whichever stock you pick will drill and you'll be posting loss porn next week.

Go read the great [Vitos's](https://www.reddit.com/user/vitocorlene/) post [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kcqkax/steel_stocks_getting_ready_for_lift_off/) and then read my [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kd8zwk/steel_stallions_unite/) after.

A Spanish newsreport reported today that "Societe Generale" a big French bank was "SEDUCED" by "$MT" because their books look better than ever. They're predicting great profits next quarter due to surge in steel price/demand which has lead "Societe Generale" to upgrade $MT rating to a BUY with a target of $39.5. That's almost a 100% increase from now. This bank is one of the big boys and it's recognising the gains that will come to fruition.

If you want to read it yoursef just Google "Societe Generale arcelormittal" and a ton of reports will come up.

**TLDR:** Buy $MT, sell before supply catches up to demand and the stock tanks. Refer to $MT's graph in 2008 for more info. Look for any information on a daily basis that suggests supply is catching up and sell. Don't be the fucking idiot who holds for too long.

I'm not posting again, go read the previous posts and make sure to send some tendies [Vitos](https://www.reddit.com/user/vitocorlene/) way after you cash out. Don't get too greedy and I hope to see some nice STEEL gain porn next year.

My position is spread bets because Europe. I know a lot of people are buying 25c for 06/2021. Good luck friends.

Title: The general public still doesn't understand PLTR, the party is just getting started
So today I was strolling around the internet and saw [this article](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/palantir-stock-strategy-savvy-political-headwinds/) that got me worked up when the author goes " Sure, Palantir is a right-wing oriented company". First off, CEO and meme-god Alex Karp holds the opposite views of Thiel (which google easily confirms). More importantly, it only confirms that the general public has no idea what PLTR truly does or how powerful the software is. **So today, I am going to take you all on an adventure and get you as close to the super scary stuff PLTR does so you can get a taste of their work. TL;DR at the bottom just make sure you look at the pictures.**

The images you are about to see come from a private think tank type business in DC that uses PLTR for their analysis of questionable activities around the globe. I linked the full reports and pulled out the best images. This data is all Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) from a variety of sources that PLTR turned from disparate data to powerful graphic with a story. The data itself comes from different countries databases including shipping registries, business registrations, transaction data, and many other country level sources. On its own, the data is useless, however, with PLTR you get complex network analysis that gives you answers to questions you didn't ask yet.

One separate thought, PLTR has been actively making the shift to a SaaS company for years. PLTR has been outsourcing the low margin government contract work (help desks, IT support, FSRs, and other functions). They have [preferred partners](https://www.palantir.com/partnerships/preferred-partners/) who do all the difficult inside of government work so PLTR can focus on being a SaaS company not a consulting company.

**Conclusion:** All of the information in those reports came from OSINT, imagine what the real version the USG uses can do. Adapt that power to the private sector and how PLTR could be used to harness data and make companies more efficient and profitable. This is basically the SkyNet prototype

**TL;DR: Former PLTR user believes PLTR's tech is still massively misunderstood and will go to the Moon. At least go back and look at the pictures if you don't like words. As WSB turns bearish on PLTR, you know its time to buy more.**

POS: 1,840 shares

DISCLAIMER: I have never worked at PLTR, only received constant rejection emails because I am retarded. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jwirsb/if_you_aint_getting_into_pltr_youre_missing_out/gcsh0pu/?context=3) is what I used PLTR for previously

Title: The Google of China is now the Google/Tesla of China: Baidu
[https://www.reuters.com/article/baidu-auto/exclusive-china-search-giant-baidu-considers-making-own-electric-vehicles-sources-idUSL8N2IR1UR](https://www.reuters.com/article/baidu-auto/exclusive-china-search-giant-baidu-considers-making-own-electric-vehicles-sources-idUSL8N2IR1UR)

The Google of China is thinking of getting into the EV game. This is a two in one package. Communist controlled search engine that controls what a billion people can jizz to, and the potential for nio like moves. Most of you retards are so busy with NIO that this whale of an opportunity will pass you by. To quote a boomer: "Buy! Buy! Buy!"

Title: Smith &amp; Wesson Spinoff has Earnings After Hours
 OK you soyboys, here is a short-term trade idea that has the potential for a major run is a Smith &amp; Wesson spinoff that IPOd in August (American Outdoor Brands - look up the ticker). They own a portfolio of companies that sell gun, hunting, fishing and camping ACCESSORIES (see below links). Earnings was supposed to be the 23rd but was moved up to after-hours today, 12/15. If you are a hunter like me, then you probably know that everyone and their mom got out this year and finding gear was much tougher than normal. My thesis:

THE FLOAT OF THIS STOCK IS ONLY 12.97 MILLION. And it is 80% institution-owned. With good news i.e. blowout earnings and some solid volume, this price could gap up and rise very quickly.

EVERY BRAND IN THIS SECTOR HAS CRUSHED EARNINGS ESTIMATES LATELY. The best comparison in my opinion is Johnson Outdoorswhich reported ER last Friday and risen more than 30% since. Sportsman Warehouse crushed ER. Dick's Sporting Goods crushed ER. Big 5 sporting goods crushed ER. All three of these sell their products.

INSIDER BUYS over last few months in the mid $13 range. And they were big dick buys too

LAST EARNINGS - Non-GAAP EPS of $0.36 beats by $0.56; GAAP EPS of $0.13 beats by $0.34. Revenue of $50.47M (+51.9% Y/Y) beats by $9.4M. E-commerce net sales grew 130%, while traditional channel net sales rose 15%. Shares +6.3%. And since a large part of their portfolio is hunting related, they should post even stronger numbers since fall is hunting season.

TRADING BELOW BOOK VALUE. According to Webull BVPS is $16.14. 

STRONG TECHNICALS. Major Support at 13.23. Bullish breakout of descending wedge. RSI about to break above the 50mark. Stock has had highs &gt;$19 and consolidated in the $14-16 range all throughout November.

RECORD GUN SALES THIS FALL. Data released on October 31st and beat the previous year's checks by nearly a million. This November beat last year by nearly 1.1 million. 

 RISKS: I mentioned earlier all these outdoor retail brand companies crushed their Q3 numbers, but many of them sold the news. Sportsman Warehouse for example has been getting crushed after an initial ER spike. However, all of these went on MAJOR runs from April to now. I think there is a chance that this could follow the trend even with great numbers. With less staycations and socially distanced outdoor activities in the future, growth projections and forecasts will probably slow down.

TL/DR: 8000 shares at 14.15. You could fuck with options but they are illiquid.

Title: C3.AI options available = get rich quick scheme
I hope Im retarded enough to make sense of some tech ipo trends Ive been watching and making predictions on but this will be the first time I act on my theories:

Most 2020 tech ipos like PLTR this year have gone up around %100 over the course of 30-45 days from the day options are available to buy and then plateau after a short seller says some shit. Today options became available for C3.AI

Word of caution: it is true that Airbnb and C3.AI had unique methods for their IPO that potentially contributed to their over valuation AND C3.AI is considered to be a hot boomer stock, which are shunned by wsb gods as sinful. Im watching everyday for the Airbnb options to be available and that might be a more attractive gamble.

Pick your poison ladies and gents. Im sunk whatever I had into 4/16/21 $AI 145cs and hope to post gains/loss end of January

TL:DR calls on AI, bitches

**Easy Short-term &amp; Long-term Gains |** Currently trading at $5.60CAD

$0.43CAD **6 months ago**

$1.30CAD **1 month ago**

$2.80CAD **1 week ago**

This company has huge potential in a newly emerging market. The main competitor to psychedelics is anti-depressants that are the leading cause of addiction. Their medicine can do really good work for many people such as those addicted to opioids or people who suffer from depression.

Long-term $MMED has been working with the FDA to have their treatments/medicine approved which is going to be huge. They also recently sold 11,364,000 to Canaccord Genuity Corp. for $50M.

Big investors like Kevin O' Leary (MindMed) and Peter Thiel (Compass Pathways) have been backing the psychedelic stocks.

Short summary for those who have no idea what MindMed is: Mind Medicine (MindMed) Inc. is a psychedelic medicine biotech company that is developing psychedelic inspired medicines and therapies to address addiction and mental illness using medicine based off psychedelic substances including Psilocybin, LSD, MDMA, DMT and 18-MC.

**tl;dr** Buy the dip on Airbnb ($ABNB) and HOOOOOODL

Top 5 Reasons to buy the dip on Airbnb

1.**Airbnb is such a powerful brand, it has become a verb**

Anytime someone rents a vacation rental, they say I got an Airbnb. Companies whose brands are so strong that they become a verb have a huge natural advantage in acquiring customers and those advantages accrue to the top and bottom line. See Coke, Zoom, Google, WD-40 and observe how their stock prices did. 

[Buy Verbs](https://preview.redd.it/m92m0mep9d561.png?width=2140&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae8d0da608f9e874fa87538cea753fc6b3bb28b2)

The strength of Airbnbs brand is starting to show up in their numbers. In their S-1, they stated, During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, approximately 91% of all traffic to Airbnb came organically through direct or unpaid channels, reflecting the strength of our brand.

Compare that to a site like Booking.com which has to spend billions of dollars per year on Google ads to generate their traffic.

2. **Aligned management incentives** 

The three founders of Airbnb own a combined 40% of the company. Their entire net worth is tied to the company. They are not going to increase their wealth by paying themselves bloated salaries. They have the same incentive as shareholders: maximize the price of the stock.

In fact, in order for their CEO, Brian Chesky, to earn more stock, he has to hit the following price hurdles. These price hurdles imply an internal rate of return of 400% for the next 10 years.  


[Show me the incentive and Ill show you the outcome. -- Charlie Munger](https://preview.redd.it/kvxzx0p79d561.png?width=2086&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df3722d8a5233348b8a9b04c2774ae955abd83c4)

3. **Unique Employee Lockup**

Employees were allowed to sell 15% of their shares in the first week of trading. That has put some downward pressure on the stock since it opened at $150/share. Since opening at $150/share, it has traded down to $124/share. After this Friday, employees cannot sell their shares for many months, dramatically decreasing the number of shares that will be sold and creating upward momentum on the stock. Now is your chance to front-run this dynamic by buying in before the price starts to rise after this Friday.  


[The dip everyone is telling you to wait for? It's happening right now.](https://preview.redd.it/5pbj7qlj9d561.png?width=2058&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da02e9b5756e2be0ed5e49804f29ceb099ceed37)

&amp;#x200B;

4. **COVID Rebound**

Airbnb is one of the best ways to play the COVID recovery that will occur during 2021. Following the Great Depression, there was a period in the United States known as the Roaring 20s. People were so happy that the depression was over, it led to an entire decade of excess spending, partying, and good times.

Many people suspect (and markets are starting to price in) that people will rush back into partying, eating out, TRAVELING, and all the other things they were prohibited from doing in 2020.

Similar to how COVID stocks such as Zoom, Shopify, Peloton soared in 2020, re-opening stocks are starting to and will continue to soar well into 2021. 

Many of you are thinking, Why wouldnt I just buy Airlines or Hotels instead of an overpriced IPO?. Its a good question, but most travel companies have huge exposure to business travel, which is not likely to fully rebound in 2021. Now that people realize how much cheaper it is to jump on a quick Zoom, analysts are expecting it to take years before business travel fully rebounds.

Airbnb is the only pure-play way to bet on the rebound in *leisure travel.*

5. **Pair Trades**

Many hedge funds, known as podshops, run what are called pair-trades to reduce their exposure to market fluctuations. 

An example would be buying Facebook and shorting Twitter. Hedge funds dont want to lose money if all social media stocks go down, so they buy the best companies in a particular secretor, while shorting the worst companies in that same sector. That way as long as the good companies outperform the poor companies, the hedge fund makes money, regardless of whether the entire sector trades up and down.

Pod shops are already starting to go long Airbnb and short other travel-related names . This is why the stock opened so far above its IPO price of $86. This trade will continue for all of 2021, or really until business-travel comes back. All Airbnb has to do is outperform the travel companies with significant business-travel exposure and hedge funds will make money. 

This is your opportunity to trade alongside the greed of Wall Street.

Title: How to play the Vaccine without buying PFE like a retard
Finally going to pay it forward by posting some DD instead of being a mooch and complete waste of space like the rest of you mouthbreathing fucks. Why should you listen to me? Because it's 3 am and I have an adderall prescription. That's about as far as my credentials go. And I'm a Registered Nurse, but me wiping ass for a living has nothing to do with this.

$R-V-P (banned ticker cause this sub only wants us to lose money and mods are gay)

(Retractable Techologies) manufactures and markets safety needle devices for the healthcare industry, and is currently on a moon mission due to the vaccine. Everyone has been playing the vaccines by which company will get there first and will be the most effective, same with shipping, but no one has been talking about how the vaccine will be distributed/given. The supply/demand for the retractable needles are skyrocketing into next year and two separate doses are needed for the PFE vaccine alone. Not to mention the countless other vaccine companies and regular flu vaccines being given.

Walgreens is currently using the needles per a pharmacist that works there. While it has run up quite a bit, there is more likely a lot more room to run. Obligatory  so it's real DD. Currently it's trading at $13/share and up 15% yesterday. Positions:15C Jan 15th/shares/doggystyle

Title: Any Europeans here? Sending you some tips from USA. Light DD.
I have been living on/off in Beverly Hills for a few years. Rodeo Drive is on my jogging route. I have noticed three things while there that you should listen to very carefully:

1. LVMH store always has a lineup. This is not new. Even today there was a line up of 20-30 people in front. See picture below.
2. Burberry is falling out of favour. It's stores are deserted. I would not be a buyer of it. I would even consider shorting (hedged third point) it if I had access to a European broker. 
3. Christian Dior is super hot for some reason. This is a new phenomenon. I never saw lineups there but now people are starting to line up. It used to be mostly older white woman brand but now I see black people starting to line up there. This fad is picking up. Fun fact. Christian Dior company has controlling stake in LVMH. Also LVMH recently bought Tiffany's. Guess which is the busiest Jewelry/watch store in Beverly Hills. Tiffany's! They also own Hennessy (the H in LVMH); which is the best Cognac.
4. If you have access to Paris Stock Exchange, consider Dior. Note to Americans and Canadians, you should not use the ADR that is OTC here because it has zero volume. Only 1-5 shares get traded in a week. We don't have access to the liquidity needed.

Title: MGNX
All you pussies around here got wet for biotech all of a sudden so heres sumn I been cooking up. Macrogenics: PDUFA date is Friday for their HER2 breast cancer therapy drug margetuximab. Supposed to be like 2.5x more effective than some competitor(trastuzumab) which does 7bil in sales. MGNX current cap at 1.3 bil. Popped a lil today and up after hours. Popped 200% on phase 3 results so imagine what shell run when they get the green light from the fda. Commercialization deal struck nov 30 for margetuximab. Institutional investors are balls deep in this and didnt sell off after phase 3 pop. Point72 doubled their position and bought 2.2 million shares at ~$23 after commercialization deal announcement. I am retarded, but stonks only go up.

SWI - Solarwinds was compromised by a group of russian hackers. The stock fell **16.69%** today.  I reckon this is just the start. 

*Someone asked me to provide a simple description of what this SolarWinds hack is all about. So for anyone who is confused by the technical details, here's a thread with a simplified explanation of what happened and what it means.* 

*The maker of software that is used in the highest echelons of gov, including the White House and NSA, was compromised by attackers who slipped malicious code into the software maker's trusted code without the software maker knowing it. The code got distributed to its customers* 

*That malicious code, once it infected customer systems, opened a backdoor into those systems and contacted the hackers to let them know the door was open for them to surreptitiously enter those systems and begin stealing sensitive data on those networks.* 

*The hackers did this back in March and their activity was only recently discovered - this means they have been inside gov systems all these months stealing data and spying on gov workers without anyone knowing until now. They also infected telecoms and other company networks.* 

*Here is a list of some of the customers who use the software made by the software maker  (their name  is SolarWinds). All of these were potentially compromised.*

*SolarWinds has hundreds of thousands of clients in all; it said in a Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure on Monday that as many as 18,000 of them were potentially vulnerable to the attack.*

*Both* [*FireEye*](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html) *and* [*Microsoft*](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/13/customers-protect-nation-state-cyberattacks/) *detailed the flow of the attack. First the hackers compromised SolarWinds' Orion update mechanism so that its systems could distribute tainted software to thousands of organizations. The attackers could then use manipulated Orion software as a backdoor into victims' networks. From there, they could fan out within target systems, often by stealing administrative access tokens. Finally, with the keys to the kingdomor large portions of each kingdomthe hackers were free to conduct reconnaissance and exfiltrate data.*

*This sort of so-called supply chain attack can have dire consequences. By compromising one entity or manufacturer, hackers can undermine target security efficiently and at scale.* 

**If you're still reading this bullshit italics then congrats autronaut. This is where it actually gets interesting.** 

*The extent of the damage is also difficult to get a handle on because Orion is itself a monitoring tool, setting up a bit of a "who watches the watchers" issue. For that same reason, systems also grant Orion trust and privileges on user networks that have value for attackers. Victims and potential targets must consider the possibility that these attacks* [*also compromised*](https://twitter.com/mubix/status/1338502543635329028) *much of their other infrastructure and authentication mechanisms using Orion's pervasive access. The extent of the exposure at US government agencies is still unknown; the revelation that DHS was impacted as well didn't come until Monday afternoon.*

**I'm just a humble lurker but this sounds like we haven't even seen the tip of the long dicking that SWI received.** 

*The White House National Security Council, which reportedly held an emergency meeting on Saturday, said via spokesperson John Ullyot on Monday that it is collaborating with CISA, the FBI, and the intelligence community to respond with "a swift and effective whole-of-government recovery."*

**Like I said earlier, I'm not an expert, but this situation is not going to improve for SWI any time soon.**

**Cleary this isn't advice and as always, do your own fucking homework.** 

1/15/20 17.5P - all aboard the autistic express.

Title: Vaccines are old news, DISTRIBUTION IS WHERE ALL THE MONEY IS GOING  
What's up retards,

&amp;#x200B;

Fellow autist here doing my part to educate the masses. Don't you wish you got $MRNA calls when that shit was trading at like $80? Fear not my fellow autists, now that a vaccine has been approved, the next step is TRANSPORTING IT! This fucking Pfeizer vaccine needs to be kept at a whopping -70 celsius (-94F), and they can't just put some ice in a box and ship that shit out. Low and behold, now these fuckers need to find a way to transports hundreds of thousands of vaccines that need to be kept cold as shit. What do they do? Find companies that make high-performance freezers. I've looked for a few smaller companies that seem capable of the job, but Middleby Corp appears to be the biggest player in the game. I read another post about this by r/SnortTheBanks , pretty brief (which I'm sure you retards love) but I dug a little deeper. 

&amp;#x200B;

Middleby ($MIDD)  makes the freezers that will be used to transport the vaccine in the temperatures it needs to be kept at. THIS COMPANY WILL PIONEER THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE VACCINE. The US has not announced anything specifically related to $MIDD yet, but you can read this if you don't believe the demand for these freezers: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/12/02/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-freezers-desmon/?arc404=true](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/12/02/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-freezers-desmon/?arc404=true) 

&amp;#x200B;

Get in this shit before news gets out. 

&amp;#x200B;

All the smart people invested in creating a vaccine. Now that we have one, the money is going into transporting it. Premiums are dirt cheap but they won't be for long. This is the calm before the storm.

POSITIONS: if you don't like options just buy shares, personally I'm strapped with $MIDD 165c 1/15/21

Title: I just bet $50,000 on VXX for this week. Here's why:
Positions first so you know this ain't bs:

https://preview.redd.it/66dzf3hsl9561.png?width=2706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59f34667e618e235010a50114d6b36972246157e

Now the reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Fed meeting tomorrow and wed. Now that we have a vaccine they are going to be less inclined to make monetary policy any easier and may even tighten. We are at artificial ath's and they don't necessarily want to pump more when they don't have to. At a certain point they are going to need to start protecting the dollar as the situation is getting worse for it rapidly.
2. Stimulus talks looking worse and worse. McConnell doesn't want to pass anything and we may not have any bill at all. Again, no need to send in more money when stocks are already high enough and pump further. I foresee them waiting on the bill until Feb or so and then assessing the situation then. 
3. GA Runoff looking more and more like it could go to both Dems. Trump complaining about it. If both dems get seat then we have a 50-50 senate and deciding vote is Kamala. That is essentially a unified dem government so a lot of big players are going to exit the market to avoid the tax situation that dems want to push.
4. People selling to take losses on the year, or even to take gains and offsetting with loss taking as well. 
5. Now that we have vaccine and things are going back to normal, people are going to use their money to buy things to impress their neighbors, as well as have experiences and travel instead of putting everything into the market as they've been doing for the past 9 months simply because there hasn't been anything to buy.

&amp;#x200B;

All of these could go the other way of course as well, but for now they look like they are pointing down. Any changes in the market and I cut the position but for now it's looking good.

Title: the biotech movement 2021 and beyond
if you trust yourself, which you don't, then that's cool, you can trust me. $SGMO a legit meme boomer biotech that hasn't catch a break since 2018. 2021 will be different. i included a visual for those who don't like to read. chart is green, that's all you need to know.

watching $CRSP, $EDIT, $NTLA all moon in my portfolio, the recent $SGMO jump on thursday - especially 3-4p was insane. something is up and volume was too. i know some of you are already all-in on $pltr, $nio, $spce, etc. but that stuff is for the bitches. this is the real YOLO play. want to live **dangerously** for 30-60 days? this is it.

think $WORK but you know it's coming. wait, this sub did know there was a $WORK sale coming and blew it. in the sector, the $ALXN acquisition, announced saturday morning, is one of many between now and end of 2021. JPM Healthcare conference in mid-january. buy now to get in on a run up. sell the news.

SGMO

* **1/15/2021 $15C**
* **2/19/2021 $19C**

EDIT

* **1/29/2021 $75**
* **2/19/2021 $90**

competitors/others in the sector have tripled in the last month ($CRSP, $EDIT, $NTLA, $FATE). now, $20 is well within reach for $SGMO. yes their shit is mostly pre-clinical but who cares it has potential and buyers have a vested interest - especially $BIIB. the CEO, Sandy - a rather bleh leader, publicly stated they're open to fair offers last friday, which indicates they may have one on the table. they could split up the company in pieces as well since there are multiple partnerships with $BIIB $NVS $PFE $GILD.

Title: Vaccine Distribution, Christmas Profits, and technical analysis that poises opportunity for breakout .
Hello Fellow Autists, I have an opportunity I wish to present to you that. 

The company is Atlas Air (AAWW). I once wrote a DD on this company a few months ago and I was right with earning blowing away expectations however I was wrong with how far OTM I should've been and only made tiny profits. This article is not an earnings play at the moment. But rather to capitalize off catalysts and protentional breakout according to technicals. 

Atlas Air Worldwide is a leader in global airfreight, that serves freight, commercial, charter, and military customers. If you ever had an iPhone or PlayStation 3-5, or watched a San Diego Chargers game you've probably been impacted by Atlas Air. They have a combination of an efficient fleet, cost-saving operations, and superior customer service. With nearly 3,600 employees working across 90 countries, Atlas Air generated 2019 net sales of $2.74 billion. 

They provide ACMI (Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance, and Insurance), whereby they provide outsourced cargo and passenger aircraft operating solutions, including the provision of an aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance, while customers assume fuel, demand and price risk. In addition, customers are generally responsible for landing, navigation and most other operational fees and costs;. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Atlas Air 747-400 ](https://preview.redd.it/21fcmxahb9561.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6072d3f0ec86050ac1dc2ea0ffb802c61b4b110)

 The company recently strengthened and diversified its business and fleet with a focus on serving express and e-commerce, which has positioned it well to handle the increased demand in online orders and the future distribution of vaccines. In the third quarter, management saw strong demand for their long-haul wide-body services. The company anticipates solid volumes in the fourth quarter, driven by continued e-commerce growth. They recently made a deal with Alibaba (BABA) to send their consumer's merchandise to South America and  allowing them to grow operations there.

 The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 7.69. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 15.53. Their biggest competitor is Air Transport Services group (ATSG) who even though has a bigger market cap, higher P/E ratio of 15.97, also happens to have a smaller fleet then Atlas Air and does not have the 747-800 which is the newest model of the 747 and most fuel efficient while carrying more weight which in this industry is crucial and helps them stand out from their competitors.  

 A resistance level has formed in the chart of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. If this level is crossed, a breakout could occur.  

AAWW saw strong earnings and revenue growth in the third quarter with earnings up 667.6% year over year and revenue up 24.9%. The stock is trading at a low valuation with a Price to Sales ratio of 0.5 and a Price to Book ratio of 0.7.

The companys cash position for the third quarter was $718 million, up from $72 million in the same quarter last year. Though that is considerably lower than its long-term debt of $2.4 Billion. AAWW has shown strong long-term momentum, but is down over the short-term. 

 AAWW has formed an important level to watch at the $57.50 (blue) mark shown below on the chart. That level was supported back in September and October, and now it has become resistance after the stock fell below it. Although it appears the stock might be headed lower, a break back above $57.50 likely means higher prices for AAWW. 

 Therefore you guys could enter a long position on a break above the resistance level with a protective stop placed under it. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yzprbsuie9561.png?width=766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08142d1be63721c347d9ba4d66536690f3ecffc8

 There are multiple catalysts that could cause this stock to break out. 

The first one is the fact that the company is being apart of the vaccine distribution and is expected for the next year to help distribute the vaccine because their aircraft can support and hold the refrigerators to carry the vaccines since they have to be kept cold. 

Second catalyst. Atlas Air has a partnership with amazon where amazon leases their fleet to transport all their shit all over the world. With the epidemic and amazon growing like crazy this has only lead Atlas Air to grow. Amazon has warrants to buy up to 23% of the company by end of 2023. And its Christmas and I have a feeling Christmas records for Amazon are about to be shattered which means Atlas Air will be busy. Also typically around Christmas through February the stock has a history of being at it's highest for the year around that time because it is their busiest season.

Third catalyst. Growth. Atlas Air is adding to its fleet and is hiring more pilots to tackle the tasks at hand. Also passenger airlines typically when doing international trips hold additional cargo in their hull to make more profits, but with less international flights due to Covid Atlas Air has had growth in customers asking them to hull freight. And assuming Atlas Air does good with these customers and makes them happy their clientele should expect to grow.  

Forth catalyst. Gasoline is pretty cheap, even though it is rising in price with vaccine news, it is still much cheaper then previously before for aircraft.

Fifth Catalyst maybe? As the coronavirus chaos is beginning to come to an end and super sexy overvalued tech companies are no longer as attractive this can lead to an emphasis on value and funds will be longer for their next growth prospects and this provides opportunity for value and growth and a way to capitalize off the coronavirus vaccine, amazon holiday season, and a ever changing world. 

To summarize, this is a well ran growing company and the stock price is poised for a breakout with a combination of these catalysts. The company is no where near its all time high yet it is the best it has ever been financially. The company is also owned over 90% by institutional investors so there is lots of smart money in the company who recognize value and the next earnings report is in February and this company tends to have a run up towards earnings. 

Literally Can't go tits up. 

I wrote this instead of taking my macroeconomics exam so I hope you enjoyed it. 

Positions

\-57.50 1/15 Calls

\-Will look to acquire more February calls once initial breakout occurs going into earnings run-up.

Title: AMC gonna moon post 2020
Theres a good amount of resistance in general from shareholders already from letting amc hit below $2. Its been hovering at most around the upper $4 before dropping.

As a cinema chain, its not in a good situation. But the recent release of 800 million in shares cashed in, will result in keeping it afloat. By mid-end of 2021 the stock will be comfortably at $6-8 as it will for sure not be bankrupted. 

There is 0% chance of movie theatres closing in general. The demand is there, and will be for a quite a while!

Title: STEEL STALLIONS UNITE
Hello my good autist friend, hope you're well. After seeing the Godfather [Vito](https://www.reddit.com/user/vitocorlene/) post a [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kcqkax/steel_stocks_getting_ready_for_lift_off/?sort=new) about steel I started hyperventilating. The TLDR; version of Vito's DD is: **Steel demand is VERY high and supply is VERY low.** Go and read the DD as the guy has worked in the industry for a long time and clearly knows what he is talking about. 

Now I ain't no fucking economist, I'm just a wall street autist, but I do know that there's a supply and demand economic law. Take a look at the graph below, friend.

&amp;#x200B;

[IF SUPPLY IS LOW THEN PRICE IS HIGH.](https://preview.redd.it/5wqrmndx28561.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27d7a692a167a2a5b0c84d32311afef607e033c6)

So now that I refreshed your memory about supply and demand, let's go back in time.

It's 2008, steel is at an all time high. How high? Well the highest exporter of steel in the world as of 2019 $MT reached a wooping $245.53 on 6th of July 2008 before plumetting harder than $SPCE today because supply finally caught up with the demand. 

Now I know you have many quesitons.. Why the fuck was it so high, yet today it's trading at $20?  
Why does my wife hate me? What happened in 2008???

Go read this article or just read the TLDR. But notice that this article was written in FEBRUARY 2008, 4 MONTHS BEFORE $MT reached an all time high of $250-ish..

[https://uk.reuters.com/article/businesspro-steel-prices-dc/global-steel-prices-the-sky-is-the-limit-idUSL0887074020080225](https://uk.reuters.com/article/businesspro-steel-prices-dc/global-steel-prices-the-sky-is-the-limit-idUSL0887074020080225)

TLDR; 

\-Demand for steel remains high, although the Western economies just collapsed.  
\-Coal prices SOAR. Coal is one of the main ingredients in steel production.   
\-Exports from China fall, causing steel prices to MOON in Europe.  
\-Experts predict steel price will continue to rise.

Rememeber the points above as we return to today.

So what's the situation right now? Vito summed it up best in his post "There is not relief in sight and many steel mills are having to purchase raw materials - iron ore and scrap at prices not seen since 2008."

Shoutout to [SteveMcHeave](https://www.reddit.com/user/SteveMcHeave/) for linking me to the [trading economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/steel-production) page where you can view each countries output of steel by month. If you Google "top 10 producers of steel", then view each countries steel production month by month, you will see that all major producers of steel are still at pre-covid levels of production except for China.

&amp;#x200B;

[USA STEEL PRODUCTION \(ALL COUNTRIES LOOK VERY SIMILAR TO THIS GRAPH\)](https://preview.redd.it/7g5vcesr68561.png?width=1508&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2b845a09690b683515c3375c5e37891cb3e4744)

&amp;#x200B;

[CHINA CAN'T SUPPLY THE WHOLE WORLD](https://preview.redd.it/mpnxbgc678561.png?width=1462&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=312025b269d0ecdb136f54abe62b00e289ca920c)

Steel mills are just starting back up and will probably reach pre-covid levels by end of year. I'm sure these mills have quite a few orders backloged because covid caused logistical issues. Suppliers couldn't deliver goods as countries shut their borders, local outbreaks at factories forced people to self isolate, etc, etc. And to add more fuel to the fire of DEMAND, vaccine news will allow world economies to start pumping again. Projects that are due to start in 2021 will begin and so will the demand for steel.

Okay one final thing.. COAL. Remember in 2008 how the price of coal soared by 65%?

Read [this article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-10/iron-ore-futures-top-150-as-china-demand-fuels-late-year-surge)  TLDR;  
\-$Vale lowers its target for iron delivery due to the dam disaster it had earlier. Vale is the second largest importer of iron to China.  
\-Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley say coal prices will continue to be higher than usual into next year.  
\-Australias bank says "If you chill the fuck out, mate, and reduce your steel production, coal will go back to normal prices". Probably won't happen as demand in west is starting to increase  
\-Australias bad weather is causing supply issues.

Now you will probably go and do some more DD and see that China's steel mills have recently asked their governing bodies to investigate the price of coal coming in from Australia. I don't think this will have much of an impact on coal because the demand is high and the supply is dropping, prices are bound to increase. China started a trade war with Australia and banned a load of Australian imports, so things will only get more interesting from here. 

As long as the supply is behind the demand the price of steel will continue to rise. As price of steel continues to rise, so will the profits of the steel producers. God speed to you and I shall see you in tendy town.

**TLDR;**

[READ THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kcqkax/steel_stocks_getting_ready_for_lift_off/?sort=new)   
Steel price will rise as supply tries to catch up with the demand. The original DD who inspired this post thinks $MT will rise signlificantly over the next 8-12 weeks.

1. Buy $MT / Arcelor Mittal as they are the biggest supplier of steel in the world as of 2019
2. Buy Schnitzer Steel
3. Buy $Vale 

Personally I'm all in on $MT. This shit could hit $60 by next year.

Title: Big DD: OnlyFans and the Power of Optionality. AKA Free Money.
Long time reader, first time poster here. I don't know that any of you autists deserve free money. Like sh\*t, if you managed to tie your own shoes, they'd probably let you on America's Got Talent. Anyways, I'm in a good mood so here's a freebie that you can leverage into getting your wife's boyfriend a nice christmas gift.

Hopefully you've seen this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoNewspaper/comments/kd062u/world\_pornhub\_removes\_all\_useruploaded\_videos/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoNewspaper/comments/kd062u/world_pornhub_removes_all_useruploaded_videos/)

And this tweet from Bill Ackman: [https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1337226836116451328?s=20](https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1337226836116451328?s=20)

Let me dumb it down for you. No more user uploaded videos to Pornhub. Amateur porn is dead on THE biggest porn website in the world. But... do you think amateur porn is dead?

If Joe Biden is still alive, so is amateur porn and, in case you didn't know, OnlyFans was already on an absolute tear, picking up IG models, Reddit OC posters, and pretty much every other bored, broke, and quarantined chick in America (and beyond). Now... the incumbent, their biggest competitor, is out of the game.

Do you know how many majors Phil Mickelson would've won had Tiger Woods retired in 1999? Y'all probably don't have enough culture to get the reference smfh. Anyways, the point is that OnlyFans is no longer a new comer in the game, it is the game.

As has been discussed in these parts, OnlyFans is rumored to be in talks to go public through a merger with HZ0N. HZ0N's board? A former Netflix executive and DraftKings' CEO. Even better? HZ0N is trading pretty much right at its $10 NAV (that's net asset value, not the Canadian cuckboy).

So what does this mean?

Bullish scenario: you invest early in HZ0N, which will take the most promising (and memeable) company in the WORLD public and who will have top notch execs guiding it. You think porn is going anywhere? HAHAHA. This is literally a one-way ticket up

Bearish scenario: HZ0N doesn't take OnlyFans public and you can get out whenever at the same $10 (if you don't get why you can get out of a SP@C at $10 at anytime, lord save you).

I'm out. If I hear one more broke bitch complain about taxing the rich after I'm giving you a FREE PASS to being rich, I'm going to lose it.

JK. I'll be in Tahiti sipping mojitos and counting my HZ0N money

**WTF is a Hydrafacial?**

Alright autists, heres your newest stonk to YOLO just in time for Christmas. Hydrafacial is the secret sauce that your Only Fans girlfriend uses to keep you coming back for more. You think her tits are the only thing shes gotten done? Wrong.

These treatments arent cheap. I spent $400 for my wife and I to get this treatment done. I thought Id be the only dude brave enough to show their face in a beauty salon. Wrong again. The place was packed with Chads and Beckys all waiting in line to get their faces done. My aesthetician said she gets repeat customers 3-4x per year to get this done. Idk about you but spending upwards of $1k per year on facials is bonkers. But this is the world we live in. Instathots make a living on how they look, and theyre willing to pay for it.

Heres the kicker: Physicians use this product too. Look up how many plastic surgeons use Hydrafacial. The average plastic surgeon salary in the US is \~$400k. You think theyd waste their time on a product that doesnt work but also doesnt pay?? Wrong again Chad. The numbers speak for themselves:

The company was on a rapid growth clip until COVID-19 hit in 2020.  However the company has seen a rebound in business and expects 57% and 38% topline growth in 2021E and 2022E.  Not only is this a fast growing company, it is highly profitable!

The cool thing about this business is that it is a razor / razor blade model.  As the install base of delivery systems continues to grow, it drives more high margin consumables.  The install base basically doubled from 8,679 units in Q1 2018 to 15,124 units in Q3 2020.

Currently 51% of sales are consumables and 49% are delivery devices.  As the installed base grows over time, the highly attractive and recurring consumables business should increase as a % of revenue, which should drive a higher valuation multiple.

**Valuation**

Hydrafacials valuation compares very favorably to leading medical aesthetic companies InMode and Align.  I will say that given Hydrafacials growth prospects, 51% of its revenues are recurring in nature and the company has outlined significant M&amp;A growth to the point where management has *a $75 million earnout to execute identified targets*, this company should trade at a premium to its peers.  If it were to trade at 9x sales, similar to market leader Align, you get to a $20 stock price! 

**TLDR**

Long VSPR/VSPRW because thats what your wifes boyfriend is getting her for Christmas, might as well make some tendies from those Becky $$$

Title: CRM - CATHIE SAYS IT'S TIME
Apparently I have to write words in order to avoid the auto-mods auto-modd-ing my pretty pictures.

I really had to poo once. In my head, I could make it to the toilet in time if I just stripped down and made a break for it. Unfortunately for me, I did not make it in time and my butt squirted something that looked like half blended bananas right out onto the floor.

Anyway, buy $CRM

Title: New Biotech Stock - barely hit the market
Yo Degenerates!

Theres a pretty hot new stock available in Europe on Tradegate. Called VACCIBODY. It just hit the shelf, but is very promising.

It trades currently around 70 Norwegian KR which is around 11,20 USD.

Pipeline: https://www.vaccibody.com/pipeline/ 

Shit is targeting Tumor Cells, kinda like Biontech. It moved 50% since its IPO and it might be a ten bagger or even more.

Title: Carnival Cruise (MIGHT) be dipping due to earnings
Hey, shitty lazy DD here: 

Carnival's earnings are out on the 18th, expecting a nice sweet dip in stock price. because obviously thats what historically kept happening this year each time they release their earnings. so why should be expect and exception this time around? 

short term cheap Puts on CCL? might print new year cash!

Title: Short $SWI! 
Hello retards. Solar Winds (SWI) just disclosed one of the worst breaches that a security company can have. That means there will be a mass exodus customers from an already sleepy security provider. 

TLDR on the hack: any customer that updated their SWI product within the last year (which is a majority of them) allowed hackers to back door any information from that customer (again, that is most of them). This means that the thousands of SWI customers information is at risk and they dont even know who is affected yet. Hackers can freely steal and sell data from these SWI, and these customers dont even know if they are affected or not. This kind of breach typically calls for contract extermination. 

Actual TLDR: SWI is fucked and we should get Rich because of it

Title: VLDR; (Velodyne), our shiny chance to visit Pluto 
No, not really, but close we will get!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Ticker; VLDR (Velodyne lidar)

&amp;#x200B;

# Before we start:

If the corona vaccine was to be experimented on all of us WSB-ers first, the government would not be able to analyze if there were side-effects of autism and retardedness. Since, err.. yeah.

&amp;#x200B;

However; At least we get to experience going visiting other planets on our rocketships every once in a while, long before any other human (or GME bagholders, sorry... not)

&amp;#x200B;

Thats why this time, I have a whole new trip set up for us! First; make sure to fasten your seatbelts, put your oxygen masks on and lets flyyy away togehter, PLUTO HERE WE COME! 

&amp;#x200B;

Let me insert a rocket here as well:  so that the retards can follow along as well and help us reach Pluto. Here is yet another one; , youre welcome.

&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**TL;dr:** *VLDR is definitly undervalued, LAZR seems to get all the hype but VLDR is the sh\*t!* 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# My point;

&amp;#x200B;

1. VLDR deliver long range sensor technologies for cars. This is relevant since we are indeed looking at a future where cars will be self-driven, and sensors is a very important part of ADAS (Automatic driving assistant system).

*Processing video pkevmpcjb7561...*

&amp;#x200B;

2. Amazons new auto-drive Taxi (zoox) uses Velodynes technology-sensors. Which will likely be in   
production in the next three years.

*Processing img d67gkpj187561...*

3. Earnings will  (weird if not) grow the following years because of delivery deals with Amazon and   
soon to be other great companies.

4. Dont miss out on Verodyne like you did on NVIDIA, shame on you.

Title: VACCINE DISTRIBUTION PLAY
Alright listen guys, no matter what your x100 up portfolio says we're still in the midst of a pandemic. Our only salvation will be a vaccine.
Smart folk realised this and invested billions to create it, a few are already approved, a few more are in the pipeline.

Vax development ship has sailed for WSB. Pharma is a closed off wanker game.

The big play in for covid pharma, one of the few left we can join and make big bucks is...

DISTRIBUTION.


I've done lengthy DD which I'll type up if this post gets enough traction, long story long there's not that many ultra-refridgerated distribution enterprises. Corporations around the world are scrambling to provide the infrastructure to distribute this vax. It's going to be an estimated $10BB&lt; market.
Ford and a slew of other boomer crap are M&amp;Aing like nuts, but they're way too late and bloated to get a sizeable chunk of the business.

We need to look for already established businesses verticalized in similar sectors, ideally having both manufacturing refrigeration systems and components, as well as strong geographically distributed logistic networks. And most importantly, some which are small enough to x500% - anything else isn' WSb worthy.


Drum roll please...

And the winner will be:
Middleby Corporation ($MIDD) 

Based in the USA, its representatives have met with state government officials in USA, as well as European in countries...
Italy already announced a temptative joint venture with Middleby

Title: Aphria (APHA) Going Up.
 

First, look at this bullish pattern.

https://preview.redd.it/7tww974027561.png?width=903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70b24b1676eeeeaa8453ad831cf735813035d676

Aphria's 3 month stock chart is forming said above pattern and it already did form a smaller one last month then proceeded to rally 25%.

https://preview.redd.it/m5zuwb9g37561.png?width=1559&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=962c90b0119dc1abad78c6021bddb2bace59ec8c

Then take a look at Tesla's chart before its recent rally.

https://preview.redd.it/7r3zrdd847561.png?width=1523&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13aacec364f3fbbf1be4f611c3403566412b4845

But how do we know this wont be a bearish pennant pattern that reverses down?

For anyone who is retarded, market cap is how much the investors value the company. This means that if the price doubles, the amount the investors value the company doubles.

...

Aphria's Market Cap: 2.3 Billion

Assets: 2.5 Billion

Liabilities: 660 Million

Revenue: 560 Million

Revenue Growth YoY: 134%

Cash on Hand: 500 Million

Short Term Debt (1 year): 170 Million

Long Term Debt (1 year+): 490 Million

...

This is a growth sector, the cannabis sector is expected to grow larger every year and Aphria has been taking market share from its competitors.

Aphria just acquired US weed-themed beer brewery and distribution company, Sweetwater, their gateway into the United States and their revenue will show up on future earnings.

We're sitting at the bottom bois, we're going up.

TLDR; Buy APHA. It's forming a large bullish pattern and it's extremely undervalued.

Title: BIDU seems like a Tendie train, and Cathy Woods just got on board.
Whats up retards, I want to hear what some of you might think about BIDU. They provide internet search and marketing solutions, and operate in China, which is obviously booming in that sector as more and more Chinese folk get connected and wired and addicted to the internet. 

Current Market Cap $44.5 Billion

P/E Ratio 16.27

They have beaten estimated earnings for the last two quarters by a rather large margin, and some bigger players have been taking notice. 

Cathy Woods just added 328,000 shares of BIDU on 12/11. If you look at the graph, this thing is printing. 

Let me know what you think but I think we could be eating some of the premium tendies with this play.

Title: NIO will Moon - The best opportunity this year
Tl;dr - NIO is a generational investment opportunity. Buy the dip ya fools!!!   
Take this DD from your neighborhood genius asian man and friend of WSB. 

China's Domestic Issues:  
\-Car ownership is rising in the millions as the middle class income is rising along with its soaring population. So is China's air pollution problem--a huge issue and international embarrassment.   
\-China is the world's 4th largest oil producer, behind the United States. This is not enough oil for China's voracious demand, so they must import tons of barrels from OPEC nations. Of course, they don't want to rely on them. Who does? Will they go to war with them like the US has done in the past twenty years? NO! Because the Chinese want to rely on a more tech-driven solution. 

EV's. Nio is an answer to many of China's problems. With battery swap technology making battery charging more affordable and faster for the driver, Nio's EV ecosystem will net billions of dollars from China alone. EV's used to be for the rich. NIO will increasingly make cars affordable for the middle class. Also, imagine if GE or Toyota made money off "fuel" in addition to selling their cars. That's what NIO will do with their subscription-based charging stations. 

International Upside:  
\-Why do you think China accepted Tesla into their country and not other businesses like Amazon, Google, or Facebook? Well, they say there's no free lunch. China wants to sell their cars to the United States. China also wants to set up EV charging stations throughout the US as Tesla will do in China--this is the next gas station business. Imagine Standard Oil level income for NIO!!!   
\-If the US doesn't agree with Nio, then China will say, "bye bye Tesla".   
\-Europe is a lock. NIO has offices in UK and Germany. Like it or not, Europe is swayed by China's money in a way that the US is still not. 

Comparables:  
\-If you wanna see how China will do in the future, look no further than Japan and South Korea. Very similar in every respect. Japan thrived after it transitioned from an agrarian economy to a manufacturing one, of cheap electronics and cars. Then it transitioned into making quality products, right after they hosted the summer Olympics, like Sony, Toshiba, Toyota, etc. It was made possible due to the Japanese people's industriousness, denial of self, national pride, and quite frankly, Asian smarts.   
\-Similar thing happened in South Korea--transitioned from making rice to making cheap manufacturing of electronics and cars. Like Japan, they're now in the process of making quality products--the surge also happening after around the time they hosted the Summer Olympics in '88. Think Samsung's phones. Think higher-end Sonatas, or LG flat screen TV's.   
\-China? China has been a manufacturing powerhouse since the 2000s. But millennial sand boomers should remember all the cheap "Made in China" jokes. This image is slowly fading as China now has Huawei, Alibaba, Tencent making new innovations in AI and commerce. This again, happened after what? The 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.  
\-So where the hell are the Chinese cars? Where is China's Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, or Kia? 

NIO!!!! Unlike Toyota, Hyundai, etc. China's manufacturers can scale to levels no other country in the world has ever done in the past.

Nio will outgrow Tesla even if it doesn't make it to the United States. But Trump is no longer in office, and I doubt Biden will be capable of doing anything meaningful to stop Nio's rise. 

CEO Upside:  
\-William Li has a perfect track record. He took a failing Auto-Review company, invested in it with his own money and became its CEO. Within years, he IPO'd it on the NYSE, making himself and fellow investors billions of dollars.   
\-Forget Jack Ma, William is often called the Steve Jobs of China. That Elon Musk Battery Day flop? It will never happen with NIO. William has an immense eye for detail. He's a showman with the most anal high standards. In 2018, he got one of the Nio cars to talk about Bruno Mars and then had Bruno Mars frickin' show up on live stream to give a talk.

Nio is a steal in the $40 range. For you impatient ones, there'll be a catalyst in Nio Day coming up on Jan 9. But if you can buy leaps or hold shares long term, this will surpass 100 bucks for sure.

Buy Nio.

Title: Pretty straightforward explanation for why VXX is set to blast off
I really hate VIX because it can be frustrating, but I have read way too much about it.  This reading has led me to believe that the time is very right for VIX, in a way both bears and bulls can benefit from, contradictory to what I assumed last week.

Tried to write this fast since my VXX calls are up like 50% from this morning [whatever time this was](https://twitter.com/yourboymilt/status/1338496770985271297?s=21)

**VIX is a measure of volatility; it is not solely a measure of SPY inversion** as many people like to think.  I go in depth [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jfhdta/volatility_for_dummies_vxx_uvxy_vxx_and_spy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), but as people want insurance on their stonks options premiums go up--the VIX underlyings are a measure of this.  TA totally works for VIX since it works for everything, but it is also very, very subject to macro principles and fundamental analysis; in other words, VIX tends to follow the fucking news, especially for things that may have an effect a month or two out.

**When looking for VIX pockets Im not looking for SPY weakness, Im looking for causes of market participants to want to insure **their individual equities and hedge SPY.  We have a few occuring right now:

**Bearish causes for premiums rising:**
**FOMC meeting tomorrow and Wednesday;**
because the market may make a critical decision regarding the purchase of treasuries, market participants are likely to have concerns about their holdings and seek insurance.  Higher premiums, higher VIX

**Stimulus talks and potential failure**: I don't have a lot of time to review how FUBAR these talks have gotten, but holy shit.  The ideas likely to pass include minimal UI insurance extension, or conversely no direct payment.  There is chatter that McConnell is holding back the stimulus, purposefully, so that the budget can count against Biden's deficit for the 2024 presidential run.  Once I heard that, my optimism waned.

**Prolonged Brexit talks**: Surprised that /ES didn't seem to care last night when UK/EU opened trading, but this has just as powerful a market effect, probably even more so, than the US stimulus.  It's be utter catastrophe economically 

*Dont forget, VIX can move when SPY is down but it can ALSO move when SPY is up:*

**The Bullish case for premiums rising:**
FOMC meeting: if the FED caps the long term treasury yield, stonks could soar, causing a rise in vlatility

**Stimulus talks:**
if the stimmy goes through, a sharp rise in SPY can cause a volatility explosion as people insure swift gains
**More vaccine news:**
Vaccine news coming fast and furious from various companies **will likely cause a spike in DIA and a drop in QQQthat dissonance and potential major sector rotation** is the type of premium-driving event that causes big volatility explosions.

**The point is, if you look at VIX as a measure of premium measurement as insurance, there are several outcomes that could jolt us, and that shockwave will cause a rise in premiums.**  VIX is also trading absurdly low for several economic outcomes, so there is that too.

I could be wrong and VXX could keep getting its ass whooped, but I don't think I am.
**VXX 12/24 18c**
**VXX 1/8 18.50c**
**VXX 1/15 20c**

**TLDR**: With VIX (and VXX and UVXY) being a measurement of volatility on either direction, and so many potentially major decisions coming to break us out of relative flatness, volatility is poised to end the year strong whether bull or ber r fuk.


*Ill put updates I see here at the top each day as I have done elsewhere, and quick news and moves aggregated here and on my twitter @yourboymilt since theres no notification format for Reddit (sorry mods, not my fault).*

Title: $EXP experion holdings - promising reports!
Im in with a pretty substantial position. Reports look very promising, and potential is huge as they up distribution and the edible market continues to soar.... all aboard ! 

https://stockhouse.com/news/press-releases/2020/12/07/experion-provides-fiscal-2020-update

TL;DR

-Premium product distribution model executed with 400% revenue growth over the first 3 quarters of 2020 versus same period in 2019

-EBITDA positive is realistic and achievable in the near term

-Nationally distributed and highly regarded premium brand: Citizen Stash

-Fully licensed and well capitalized

-Under-valued with a market cap below cash and assets on hand

-Significant upside as we continue our growth and begin to raise the company's profile in the investment community

Dont miss the moon 

Title: $ATVI - actual product pipeline, revenue, and profit. Probably not for you then.
1/15/2020 90c. Already up 130%

Too late? Nope. At $86 ATVI is a steal. Shadow lands and CoD breaking revenue records. Candy crush crushing. Buddy says he's never seen so many new people in WoW. I don't play because I'd rather make a few thousand a year playing options on wow expansions than pay $15 a month and all my time playing them. 

Add to that a killer 2020 lineup. Free virtual blizzcon in February, where it's anticipated that they'll announce a release date and maybe even beta for overwatch 2. Overwatch league is already winding down, re organizing, and preparing for big changes. 
Diablo iv in the pipeline, we'll get a looksie but no release until later year or 2022.

BUT that means diablo immortal will be in the spotlight. And ohhhh boy will china love that fucking game. Crazy loot running on your phone? Don't you have phones?

And that's only blizzard, nevermind the rest of activision's catalog of old school console games they can reboot on next gen systems.

All the bad press is about layoffs, consolidations, and office closures to increase their profit margins and everyone is so hurt about it because their profits are so high already. Say what you will about morality, this is great for the stock price. 

I'm not a big time smart investor. I just know atvi gives me consistent gains yoy and enjoys decent volume and interest on most dates around earnings. Just don't play actual earnings.

Title: get on eBay train before its too late
Calls up 25% since post on Friday. Now is the time to find undervalued stocks!

Look at the fundamentals.

Door Dash has a higher market cap than eBay, but eBay has 8 times more profit and 3 times more revenue. eBay's Q2 in 2020 was its best Q2 ever, it's Q3 the second best ever, and its Q4 will be the most profitable in the company's history.

Airbnb's market cap is 2 times higher, yet eBay has 2 times higher revenue and 3 times higher profits. Airbnb's annual growth rate is shrinking YoY and eBay's is increasing.

Where can you safely buy the most purchased video games system in history (PS5) without leaving your home? eBay.

Conservative price estimate for eBay is $55-63. At $50.30 today, price is still at a discount.

Title: The Prophecy: Volatility shall explode forthwith (VXX, UVXY, SPY)
My only regret is that I could not type faster; the VXX calls I bought this morning are up ~50%

I really hate VIX, but I have read way too much about it.  This reading has led me to believe that the time is very right for VIX, in a way both bears and bulls can benefit from, contradictory to what I assumed last week.

**VIX is a measure of volatility; it is not solely a measure of SPY inversion as many people like to think. ** I go in depth [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jfhdta/volatility_for_dummies_vxx_uvxy_vxx_and_spy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), but as people want insurance on their stonks options premiums go up--the VIX underlyings are a measure of this.

Title: DD: Live Oak Bank, Why are we not even more Bullish on this group?
Using my throwaway for this one.

Live Oak Bank (LOB) is the number 1 SBA Lender in North America and one of the best banks for the future. How you retards have missed this, I have no idea. Its unbelievable what they do, how they do it.. First an SBA Loan for retards that do not know is a government backed loan by the Small Business Administration that can take most of the risk from the loan by backing up a large principle amount and allowing the bank to make net interest income with minimal risk to spur small business growth. 

Leadership: Live Oak Bank is headed by a man, Chip Mahan as CEO. Chip was responsible for the S1 online banking system and founded the new bank in Wilmington NC. He is pretty unorthadox but appreciates hard work. Under his guidance, Live Oak has grown enormously and is about to upend banking through technology, VC/strategic investments, and not being a fucking retail banker.

Neil Underwood is the President of Live Oak Bank and of the Live Oak Bank VC arm, Canapi ventures. Neil helps eye up the strategy of technology and partnerships through Canapi. Canapi is a fund of 86 other banks, that once a FinTech gets investment from Canapi, it almost guarantees 86 large customers. [https://canapi.com/our-companies/](https://canapi.com/our-companies/) 

Live Oak Bank is HQ'd in Wilmington NC as its one and only branch. LOB runs 3 Private Jets with pilots and airline staff as employees of the bank. Those aircraft are what Chip deems their flying branches, where they fly to cities around the country to close on SBA Loans. Yes. They fucking fly on private jets to do sales calls. 

They also keep a number of experts on hand as either consultants or employees to help advise customers on building out their small business. Going to build a veterinarian clinic? They got actuals Vets that will advise you on SEO, signage, marketing, and partnerships to grow your clinic. You want to open up a Storage units? They got a guy that will go into such great detail to advise you on the right concrete and exact dimensions to utilize for maximum benefit to your business. LOB is like Rick from Pawn Stars - they got a guy for every business and they're all exceptionally successful and give your business access to these folks. 

Now the bank does give out loans and businesses are hurting, but they have such a great story around this. If they determine the cashflow of a business is not doing great, they intervene when they sense trouble with their experts to help turn their loans around. Which is why they have such a low default rate on their SBA loans in general compared to every other bank in the US. Plus they sell off loans too. 

Now here's where I get excited. The Bank says they are a tech company that operates as a bank. This is 100% true. A software IPO that came out this year was nCino. You know who basically created nCino? LOB. Thats right, Chip Mahan and Neil Underwood were behind nCino and i think still have some investment individually in nCino. nCino is a full on massive Commercial Lending and Bank Operating system that uses Salesforce as a backend database essentially. In Backing its THE system every bank has to have because its so easy for management to make sure their lenders are doing more than playing golf. And they are also HQ'd in Wilmington, NC. 

Live Oak is also heavily invested in Apiture, an online banking system that was formerly part of First Data, but spun out after the Fiserv acquisition. Apiture is an independent entity and just raised $20 million.  They are going to be one of the first online banking systems to take advantage of the new "Open banking" and API capabilities. (seriously banking is so outdated).

There is a core system that Canapi is invested in (does the GL work of the bank) that i have no idea if Live Oak will use it but my guess would be yes if it works. They will likely be backing Greenlight (which is a FinTech unicorn). 

&amp;#x200B;

There is so much more here though. They are just at the forefront of the industry and are just going to continue to kill it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what I got:

&amp;#x200B;

500 Shares I bought at 12.94 this year

100 shares at Roughly $42.

I do conservative options but 2 contracts at $50 expiring in June (bank stocks are notoriously slow growth in general).

Title: Why TSLA will be a $2.65T Company by 2026
By 2030, 50-60% of the cars on the road with be Teslas. 90% of the EV's on the road will be Teslas. 

There will be more hype in Tesla models then there ever has been in any other car maker. Tesla will be the iPhone of cars in terms of demand, and Tesla will completely dominate the EV market from 2025 - 2030. Why you ask?

Competitor's battery tech is so far behind Tesla, that in order to sell an EV at a competitive price in the next 5 years they'd have to sell their EVs at a loss. All the while, autombile manufacturers that rely on combustion engines will be losing sales to the EV market, and if they did put out an EV (not even likely at a positive margin), they'd only be cannibalizing their combustion engine sales. Tesla will easily dominate the EV market in the next 5 years. And by dominate, I mean obliterateuntil they're practically the only EVs on the road.

Even if competitors did sell an EV at a comparable price to Tesla models. Why would anyone buy them when Tesla is the only company in the world that has software for autonomous driving? Tesla will dominate the autonomous driving market until 2035 or 2040 and probably far beyond. The only company that can catch up to the self-driving technology that TSLA has, and then not be too chickenshit to actually start implementing it might be Alphabet... and maybe Apple? But guess what? They don't make cars. Maybe they can sell it to Nissan when Nissan finally catches up in battery technology by 2040? or 2050?.. and also redesign their Leaf to not look stupid as shit? There you go Tesla bears.. I threw you a bone.

Tesla's EVs make 40% margin. If autonomous driving is added on as a subscription, then Tesla will make back the cost of the car and then some in only 5 years or so. Robo taxis will be paying Tesla indefinitely.. many many times the actual cost of the car. This gives plenty of incentive for Tesla to create cars that actually last 300k - 500k miles. Creating cars that last 500k miles would reduce operating costs and the need to keep building factories and spitting out worthless cars at a crazy pace the way Ford and Toyota do. Yay for the environment too! Tesla might even consider selling cars at a lower margin.. 20% if they knew that you'd be buying subscriptions to autonomous driving (maybe a contract agreement?). This will further the domination of the EV market. Eventually Tesla will have millions of cars on the road, with the drivers subscribed to self driving and the money will just pour in. ABSOLUTE. MARKET. DOMINATION. All the while, other car companies might be getting caught up in battery tech to sell a $30k car but \*holds in laughter\* Tesla will sell you a car at only $20k if you agree to a year of an autonomous driving subscription!

Now why would anyone buy a Nissan Leaf when you can have a Tesla for $30k (or $20k with a year of autonomous driving! pay as you go!) that actually lasts for a couple decades? By the way, value Tesla Customer! Don't forget to sign in on the app and buy a month of autonomous driving for your road trip next summer!

Tesla will start selling car insurance as well. Make any modifications you need to your car insurance policy through the app. You can be as granular as adding collision for a few months, or comprehensive while you're on vacation and worried where you might need to park. But don't worry investors, Tesla won't be swindled on the cutomizable car insurance.. they know how you drive.. they have the data.. a loooot of data. 

&amp;#x200B;

By 2035 or 2040, Tesla will be \*the\* name associated with all your automobile needs.

&amp;#x200B;

My price target: $2800/share by 2026. That's a $2.65T cap.

Additional external things to help make this price target a reality:

Inflation going up per JPow's goal of "averaging" 2% a year (any year where consumers struggle will usually result in a lower than 2% inflation.. giving free rein on the money printer button), big money putting their big money into assets for the next few years at least to avoid the higher than 2% inflation.

ETFs create bubbles. In my opinion, not the bad kind of bubbles. The kind of bubble where companies are valued much greater than a traditional valuation because noobs are buying the fuck out of SPY. Guess who gets to join the "I'm buying you because I don't understand stocks!" party?

&amp;#x200B;

My positions:

First, I bought a March 2021 $1920 the day of the split announcement for $23k. This is largely what funded my current positions:

73 shares

Sept $420c

My idea:

I will likely put all $75k of my portfolio into TSLA shares and/or LEAPS, and make regular semi-monthly contributions (24 times a year) of about $625 ($15k annually) for the next 5 years straight into shares. In moments of relatively lower volatility or a stupid low dip, I might sell some shares to buy ITM LEAPS calls, and vice versa after a pump.. once hitting a 100-200% gain on the LEAPS, sell it and put it back into shares. Essentially, maintain a decent delta on the ride to $2800. Sell the occasional covered call, but be careful and patient as fuck to get a ridiculously high strike that's pumped as hell. Just these last couple weeks you could sell a $1000 strike for a few hundred dollars. Put covered call premiums into more TSLA shares.

&amp;#x200B;

I've done the math. Assumptions:

TSLA going straight up to $2800 linearly to the beginning of 2026

$75k initial investment in shares. $625 semi-monthly contributions up to 2026 (additional $15k\*5=$75k in contributions for $150k total)

No consideration of leveraging with LEAPS and no consideration of selling covered calls

This will yield $640k in Jan 2026.

A lower target of $2000/share yields $435k in Jan 2026.

Link to the math: [https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=let+a+%3D+%281%2Br%2F24%29%3B+let+r+%3D+.355%3B+let+n+%3D+24\*5%3B+p%3D75000\*a%5En%2B625\*%28%28a%5En-1%29%2F%28a-1%29%29](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=let+a+%3D+%281%2Br%2F24%29%3B+let+r+%3D+.355%3B+let+n+%3D+24*5%3B+p%3D75000*a%5En%2B625*%28%28a%5En-1%29%2F%28a-1%29%29)

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons I might make more:

Proper use of LEAPS calls as stock replacement

selling occasional covered calls successfully

TSLA dipping a lot, so as long as it eventually hits the target price. This will cause my semi-monthly contributions to "buy low."

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons I might make less:

fucking up with a covered call

TSLA hitting target before 2026, this would cut back on the number of contributions I can make prior to the target and my contributions would be "buying high." But this would be a good problem to have.

Title: NNOX: the New Flat-Screen
Alright baby diapers listen up. My brother is wicked smaht and is going to be a lawyer or something so he's probably an inside trader. He said NNOX is about to moonshot. If thats not enough to convince you,  here's some DD (I still don't know what that stands for):

Some old Samsung nerds made some technology that allows mri or xray or whatever those kind of machines are smaller and portable. Remember your roommates (aka your parents) old clunky analog TV? Sucked balls. Then digital TVs came around and blew everyone's giblets off because you didn't need an industrial crane to get it to your basement. Well guess what? NNOX IS THE NEW FLAT SCREEN you wacky F Tards. 

If you are sick of your wife's boyfriend always hanging around sucking up all your wifi, this is your chance for free tendies so you can finally by some noise canceling headphones so you don't have to hear her getting porked. See you on the moon!

Title: CGRO spac with innoviz technologies is a much cheaper version of LAZR
collective growth corp just did a spac with Innoviz technologies which is basically the same as LAZR some of you need to do some research on it. LAZR has a massive marketcap of 10b right now even when its dropping hard whereas CGRO is about 1.5b but innoviz has partnerships with samsung and bmw and a host of other top companies i think CGRO is a definite buy.

Title: Velodyne (VLDR) | Lidar | RoboTaxi | Amazon Zoox | VLDR $30 calls
Today it was announced that Amazon unveiled its robotaxi (Zoox) \[1\]. It's not in production yet, but it will likely be in the next 3 years.

As an investor, one should always look for platforms and growth. So I tried to find the lidar that underpins the ADAS (automatic driving assistant system). And it turns out it was velodyne (VLDR) in 2018 \[2\]. **Note:** I couldn't find anything recent about Zoox's current LIDAR vendor. The vendor may have changed.

The takeaway is that as these company move from prototyping to production, whatever sensors that have will experience growth on par with that client/end use. T

Therefore, VLDR should be a great call play as news flow and earning increase in 2021.

Title: SRAC Merge with momentus. Good potential involving sir Elon Musk! 
Here's a cap on Momentus Space (MNTS) and why it's a fabulous bet and or investment.
A. It's a proxy play to Space X (Elon Musk Hello)
momentus.space/...
B. Bill Akman
Momentuss largest investor is Prime Movers Lab, a venture capital firm backed by high-profile investors including hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman and Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale.
I'll take this over PSTH (I own both)
C. Momentus is the second space company to go public after SPCE, we know how well that has performed . So we have knowledge that Momentus has struck several agreements with satellite companies, SPACE X, Alba Orbital AND 3D Printer maker Made in space to just name a few. Hot sector!
D. Vigoride "last mile delivery"
Vigoride scheduled to launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in December 2020. The launch marks the first time Momentus' vehicles will carry customers, following a successful in-space test of Momentus' groundbreaking water propulsion technology. Innovative and active!
E. I think this will help! Long SRAC!

Title: Understanding VIX
Vix goes higher = Market goes down 

Vix goes lower = Market goes up

Vix peaked during Dotcom bubble, 08 GFC, March 2020. 

Vix this year peaked at March, June, September, Late December-Early November. 

Look at VIX before making decisions and saying a company is dying.

Title: Aphria (APHA) Up.
First look at this bullish pattern.

https://preview.redd.it/5zv8sedi24561.png?width=903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e56c9725ccf38a1dbfb11f68b9c43387c30ce98

Aphria's 3 month stock chart is forming said above pattern and it already did form a smaller one last month then proceeded to rally 25%.

https://preview.redd.it/1t6erxon54561.png?width=3173&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bce596e68d44b3ff17a3f133e91fb9f9075f6296

Then take a look at Tesla's chart before its recent rally.

https://preview.redd.it/8eyfnr12b4561.png?width=3146&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67ee77b3f1e1c9a7ee08755f183b7e7f974d30f1

But how do we know this wont be a bearish pennant pattern that reverses down?

For anyone who is retarded, market cap is how much the investors value the company. This means that if the price doubles, the amount the investors value the company doubles.

...

Aphria's Market Cap: 2.3 Billion

Assets: 2.5 Billion

Liabilities: 660 Million

Revenue: 560 Million

Revenue Growth YoY: 134%

Cash on Hand: 500 Million

Short Term Debt (1 year): 170 Million

Long Term Debt (1 year+): 490 Million

Aphria just acquired US weed-themed beer brewery and distribution company, Sweetwater, their gateway into the United States and their revenue will show up on future earnings.

We're sitting at the bottom bois, we're going up.

TLDR; Buy APHA. It's forming a large bullish pattern and it's extremely undervalued.

Title: Chart industries
Quick dd with the vaccine roll out there is one well many hurdles but, it needs to be super chilled during shipping, well there is one company on the stock exchange you most likley never heard of and it specializes in just that. Cryogenics (started for freezing bull seman but they have since branched out to many other things, have worked with nasa) under the ticker GTLS they had explosive growth under everyone's noses, now they will be in even more high demand, my 2 cents

Title: DD: Biggest publicly traded online betting company since Draft Kings. LCAis merging with Golden Nugget Online Gaming into GNOG Friday, 12-18-20. Discounted now after last week. Stop gambling on meme stocks like broke degenerates and bet on the online gambling industry like big money degenerates.
 TL;DR at the bottom for your short attention spans.

You heard of **Draft Kings**? Remember how much that stocked  jumped up? **$10 to $50 in 3 months, that's a 400% increase.** Did pretty well didn't it. It's been the only publicly traded online betting company on the stock market till this week.

**Landcadia Holdings II LCAis merging with  Golden Nugget Online Gaming to become $GNOG on Friday 12-18-20.**

The upsides on this company are huge:

* **Net Revenue of $25.9 million compared to $13.5 million during the same period in 2019, an increase of 92%**
* **Gross Gaming Revenues of $28.9 million, compared to $14.9 million during the same period in 2019, an increase of 93%,**
* **Operating Income of $8.2 million versus $4.2 in the third quarter of 2019, an increase of 92%.**

**The  owner is Tilman Fertitta, billionaire businessman who owns the Golden  Nugget casino and betting chain, the Houston Rockets and Landry's Inc.  which is the parent company that owns the franchise rights to Bubba  Gump, Joe's Crab Shack, Morton's steak house, Rainforest Cafe among 40  other popular restaurants.** He also owns  a variety of other properties and business ventures.

"In 2018, his net worth was estimated at $4.5billion, placing him at No. 153 on the [Forbes 400](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes_400) list of the wealthiest Americans;[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilman_Fertitta#cite_note-ForbesBillionaires-1) *Forbes* calls him the "World's Richest Restaurateur".[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilman_Fertitta#cite_note-forbes3-6) "

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landry%27s,\_Inc.#Properties\_and\_subsidiaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landry%27s,_Inc.#Properties_and_subsidiaries)

The downs sides:

The  only downsides I have found is that LCAwas created by Tilman, which  some people find sketchy, but makes a lot of sense to me. He was looking  to bring his company public and wanted extra investments to bring one  of his most successful companies public.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Online  betting is an ever growing industry and in my opinion Golden Nugget is  the only other online gambling company worth investing in besides Draft  Kings.

The global online gambling  market size was valued at USD 53.7 billion in  2019 and is expected to  grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.5% from 2020 to 2027.

TL;DR

LCAis merging with Golden Nugget Online Betting on Friday, 12-18-20 into  $GNOG. Last weeks shit fuckery dropped it down and I think it'll drop a  little more on Monday, making it a good time to get in on the only other  publicly traded online betting company besides Draft Kings. It's got 4  days to rally and I think it'll pop hard on merger.

This  is finally a SPAC with an actually valuable company behind it, a successful billionaire owner and a huge injection of money coming.  I am  willing to bet that this online betting company will start to moon  starting on Friday's merger vote or the following week after the ticker  changes.

Title: YSG - Invest in China's Emerging Becky - Fundamental DD Inside - YSG
For my next round of some fundamental DD, I'm going to be building off of my overall view for the next 6 months of investing in the Chinese consumer - specifically, looking for overlooked companies in the **Chinese Consumer Discretionary** space. 

Unfortunately, the call I'm making here currently *does not offer options yet*, but when they do launch, this Company exhibits all the right attributes to make a first post-IPO earnings play / LEAPs on. 

*So why the fuck am I posting this on WSB if there are not YOLO options plays available?*

Because there is a high probability that there will be a rotation out of all of our favorite meme stocks as 2020 winds to a close (it may already be happening). This, plus the return of mass upside Call option buying has driven some outrageous premiums on options &amp; as of now, most are on the expensive side. I would make a whole post on this with some nice cool charts &amp; shit, but even the sentiment of the memes posted here should tell you enough. 

Overall - *When WSB starts to even question if a bubble is forming, you know you should be treading very carefully.*

So get your tendies &amp; park them in a SPAC or some shit or follow me into China's Becky until the next meme arises.

With that said, here we go: 

**I. Overview of "Why" Chinese Consumer Discretionary:**

Here's a quick overview of the 14th 5-Year Plan:

&amp;#x200B;

[China's 14th 5-Year Plan - Additional details in late Q1'21 \/ Early Q2'21](https://preview.redd.it/89jdb7op93561.jpg?width=586&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=858f521d1fcf8934997629a40178209074488377)

On top of fiscal support for these new industries - China is arguably ahead of the entire world in terms of handling COVID-19:

**II. Bet on the Emerging Chinese Becky - Yatsen Holding Limited (NYSE: YSG)**

Some high level stats:

* Founded in 2016 - priced IPO on 11/19/20 led by Morgan Stanley &amp; Goldman Sachs
* China is the **largest beauty industry in the world** with **$38.8 billion** in retail sales in 2019 \[1\]
   * YSG as of 9/30/20 only has a 1% market share with year over year revenue growth of **+377%**
   * If including overseas sales by Chinese cosmetics companies - totals **$79 Billion which is nearly \~2x the size of the next largest market (USA)**
* China also has one of the largest Gen-Z &amp; Millennial populations in the world with 171.4 million Gen-Z &amp; 231.5 million Millennials as of 12/31/19 \[1\]
* YSG currently has 3 brands: *Perfect Diary, Little Ondine, &amp; Abby's Choice*:

&amp;#x200B;

In addition - **Wall Street pegs the Chinese beauty market to be a $160 Billion industry by 2025E ($79Bn in 2019)**

**What's so unique about YSG?**

**\~90% of their sales come from DTC channels vs. peer average of \~56%**

How are they doing this? These guys are crushing the Chinese social media game (Rank #1 in Chinese social media):

[As of Sept. \/ Oct. 2020](https://preview.redd.it/g8sy5mctg3561.jpg?width=643&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae1b1dd0c777073f5b2ae89eb70b2f9ee8518350)

But the established brands? What about them?

**Chinese people like buying Chinese-branded things:**

[99.5&amp;#37; of Surveyed consumers have used domestic color cosmetic brands \[1\]](https://preview.redd.it/ybfjqb57h3561.jpg?width=257&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=871cb1d6dd9564eb63f952ede0b6bfa06de41759)

**III. Financials**

Here's a quick snapshot with some cool circles &amp; shit on parts I want to talk about:

&amp;#x200B;

[As of 9\/30\/20](https://preview.redd.it/1335ft27i3561.jpg?width=618&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a891e9f0e65712ce68d021644111365805abeb4)

So far we've laid out the upside in the **Revenue growth** case. So far they've grown Revenues at a clip of +102% CAGR LTM as of 9/30/20. 

On top of this extraordinary growth, there are some things that can be financially engineered as well.

First off - Gross Profit Margins at 63%, while slightly better than the COTY/Kardashian GP Margin of 57%, it's still a ways to go vs. L'Oreal's GP Margins of 73% \[2\].

**Why is EBITDA negative?** This is driven by their bloated S&amp;M + G&amp;A expense that clocks in at 56-62% of Revenue (vs. other Chinese brands at \~41% \[3\]), which would be a cause for concern, HOWEVER, the marketing strategy is ***working****,* evident in their inventory turnover of 98 - 110 days (shit is flying off the shelves)

* COTY's comes in at 135 days, L'Oreal at 141 Days \[2\]. Compared to their Domestic cosmetic company peers they are only bested by Proya by less than 10 days. 

This all culminates into a business that has a cash conversion cycle of 37 days (among the lowest in peer group) with many levers to improve on this that I won't bore you with here. For the curious that want to do their own DD, look at their Payables structure. There's a ton of improvement that can be done here.

**With all this said - Wall Street estimates +78% growth in Net Revenues by 2021E which is woefully conservative, but I'll be using their estimates for the next section on Price Target**

**IV. Price Target**

At current price of $16.55/Share - they trade at 7.3x EV/2021E Sales &amp; 5.1x EV/2022E Sales. **Important to note: Sales CAGR through 2022E is expected to be +60%.** 

This is vs. the entire beauty comp set of 3.3x / 3.0x, respectively - on average Sales CAGR through 2022E of +**10%**. YSG is expected to grow at ***6x*** the comp set.

What about vs. Chinese peers? 4.7x / 3.9x, respectively on +**19%** Sales CAGR through 2022E. YSG is expected to outpace their growth by **3x.**

*So what's the right multiple?*

I'm pegging YSG at 11x EV/Sales on average between 2021E/2022E EV/Sales - this is a **20%** discount in growth vs. their Chinese peers which shakes out to an exit price of **$27.75 per Share or +70% from Current.**

**TL;DR. Invest in the Chinese Becky (NYSE: YSG) for potential +70% gains from Current until the Options market gets a bit more affordable.**

Title: Made $16k in 24 hrs on PRPL last options expiration, or how to play max pain!
Yep.   I made $16k in 24 hours by playing against MMs move to max pain on the last options expiration.  


Proof:

https://preview.redd.it/q2rmkpgtm2561.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4964298a012ca2bc8535d44a85909f6403bc2a1

I sold 400 30p 11/20's for \~$0.40 each for about $16,000 in profit on the day before expiration when the stock price was about $29.70.   Why did I take such a "risky" move?   Because PRPL religiously follows max pain when it isn't in the middle of its mid-quarter run up.

# What is Max Pain?

I'll spare you my own detailed explanation and let you google it yourself (or for the lazy, start [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maxpain.asp)).

Basically, Market Makers' delta hedging actions, in the absence of an underlying or external force driving movement in the stock (aka news event), will force a stock to land at the max pain price on options expiration.

No, it isn't some sinister coordinated action against you.   It's just the math of the position and strategy that Market Makers take.

And yes, this is a controversial topic in some circles, but so is Wall Street Bets.  Those circles are clearly stupid on both accounts.   We know what we are doing here.

# Why don't all stocks follow this and how come everyone doesn't just play this?

Two words:  retard strength.  Never ever, ever, ever attempt to play this against a stock with a constant influx of retards buying up positions on the stock (looking at you Tesla!), aka retard strength.

Retard strength and major news events present a gamma risk to the market makers and can cause movements in the underlying price of the stock that they are unable to "manage" to the same degree.  As the market makers are constantly trading their hedges, new buyers (or sellers as it may be) can provide price support outside of max pain targets.

***THIS*** is exactly why PRPL is PERFECT for max pain plays.   Outside of its traditional late-quarter run up into ER, PRPL is about as boring as it was for your date your first time in bed.    There's very little short-lived action and nobody is talking about it much the next day.

# PRPL and Max Pain

[Historical Max Pain Data from Opricot](https://preview.redd.it/qey2gnwvp2561.png?width=701&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0609d0a040260fa5c1f22b7044647f39f7974108)

Let's look at how well PRPL has tracked against max pain, EVEN for post-ER price action.   See, PRPL tends to get very excited on the run up to ER (it blows its load early), and disappoints when it is time to score (Joe Megibow, while a great CEO, is the anti-Elon-Musk in terms of ER excitement).   For max pain plays, this is perfect because there is no external price support outside of MM's driving to max pain.

Even for the infamous Q2 ER that I called wrong, PRPL ended at max pain just days later.

PRPL works really well for max pain because there is an inordinate amount of option activity compared to a relative small amount of stock volume.   It's the perfect scenario for a MM to maximize their strategy, but it makes PRPL price action ***PREDICTABLE.***   If you can predict the price and the timing, you can make money using options (and stock trades), ***ESPECIALLY*** because PRPL tends to have fairly wide swings between expiration dates (noted above).

All you simply need to do is make a play on an outside swing betting that it will return to max pain, and voila: tendies.

# What are the risks?

Clearly, you are in the wrong sub if you just asked this question.   For the benefit of the outsiders who don't truly belong here:

1. max pain is a moving target
2. max pain can't be perfectly calculated
3. news events can break the pattern (which is why this works on boring stonks with high option volume relative to stock volume)

**Max Pain is a Moving Target**

https://preview.redd.it/ck0rcxoer2561.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7b6678cdd1cc09e0131252a19b0abfb4c1d7c42

Our very own [Swaggy Stocks](https://swaggystocks.com/dashboard/options-max-pain/PRPL) has one of the best max pain calculators I've seen ([this one](http://maximum-pain.com/options/PRPL) is ok too, especially if you don't want to pay for Opricot).   Towards the bottom of Swaggy's is a historical max pain chart which helps explain that max pain is a moving target.

People are constantly buying and selling options.   The net of the open interests and strikes is the max pain price.   So, max pain can move on you after you've made your play (which is why I wait till closer to expiration).

**Max Pain Can't Be Perfectly Calculated**

While we know open interest and strikes, we don't necessarily know WHICH SIDE of the play the market makers took on each play.   This doesn't invalidate max pain theory, but it presents a risk that should be understood when making these plays.

If you assume that the market maker is always taking the short side of an options play, you will likely be generally correct (because who's theta gang, really?  Oh right, me.), and can rely on max pain as a guideline.

**News Events Can Break the Pattern**

An inordinate amount of volume from a news event or retard strength can break max pain theory on a stock (see the PRPL expirations BEFORE ER that are the run up to ER).   I probably won't play January on PRPL, but I'm playing December.

# Prediction and Positions

My prediction is that PRPL ends very close to max pain of $30 again on 12/18, which would represent a nice movement up from the close on Friday of $27.435.   Of course, you autists could all pile in and move the max pain target on me, but I thought I would take that risk and share this.   Assuming you guys don't bring retard strength in a bad way (move max pain and then deflate the price action activity at the end of the week, allowing a max pain ending at a different price), then we will see $30 by week's end.

https://preview.redd.it/gc0yec3at2561.jpg?width=932&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cd9b05b0f7797c4ec37da569b4c170cab2f7cc3

I'm playing 100x each of 25c, 30c, and short 30p.   All 12/18's.

This isn't investment advice, nor a recommendation, but for you autists who can't put two and two together:   shares and ITM calls.

If you guys jack this up, then lesson learned from me, and I'll never remind you of this again.   You will all forget about it like the goldfish you are and I'll play it again after next earnings for some tendies.

# Technical Astrology

You all know what I think about Technical Analysis.    Confirmation bias at best, and a cheap fortune cookie most likely.

The Technical Astrologers on Stocktwits are calling for similar price action to the 30's next week based upon magic charts:

https://preview.redd.it/jrr7a86du2561.png?width=687&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57f9a6cbef45634f68cef6cdbb7e8f23b7269c21

I shamelessly swiped this from some guy's post calling for a double bottom, which means things are looking up.    I don't know about you, but a double bottom means a threesome to me, which means things are looking up.

I put about as much weight into the above TA as this:

https://preview.redd.it/85sylewmu2561.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddb4395192ae24c5f4a1975bbc42aeb65af3444b

The above is still related to double bottoms and threesomes.   Clearly she didn't take into account her own game when making this stupid COVID rule.   For any man or woman brave enough to take that on, it counts as a threesome.   Legally.

The in-between skin on rolls is usually purple, so buy PRPL.

# The Big Boys are Doing It

BlackRock increased its holdings by 53.7% in PRPL during 3Q, according to their latest 13F, so they know own about $36.3M in PRPL.   Vanguard also increased their position.

I'm very bullish still long term and think we'll see this baby in triple digits in the next two years easily based upon their announced manufacturing capacity and the fact that they still sell everything they make.

There's definitely opportunity in short term plays though.

Title: PLTR will go up this week and save the West this century
PLTR currently sits at a $50B market cap. Insane right? 

&amp;#x200B;

Until you realize DOCU has a $40B market cap and is literally just a scribbling app for PDFs. ZM has a $115B market cap and is just new old Skype facing free competition from MSFT and GOOG. MDB has a $20B market cap and is a free database competing with other free databases.

&amp;#x200B;

What makes a stock moon these days? Valuations are high as fuck, but there's more money slushing around then ever before. Investors need to be able to justify high valuations; they'll pay any price for  a company they believe can plausibly "change the world". Companies that could command a $1T market cap someday. What're the only companies that could plausibly do that right now?

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla. SpaceX (but you can't buy it yet you poors). Palantir.

&amp;#x200B;

We're going to war with China in the next 20 years. Cold war or hot war, one way or the other it's happening. AI will be a component of all future military systems. Improved targeting, response times, defense. This will be the 21st century's arms race. Hundreds of billions of $$ will be spent. Every Silicon Valley company has already pledged it won't build these systems for the US gov't (yes, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon are all traitors). Except for Palantir. Palantir's mission? Save the fucking West. 

&amp;#x200B;

ZM and DOCU and MDB \*combined\* shouldn't be worth what PLTR is worth. Strap in boys. We're going to make a fuck ton of money while we save this country.

&amp;#x200B;

KOS NYSE @2.30 

Buy it just do it. Im sleepy and too lazy to explain why and honestly it doesnt matter some retards here will buy it anyway. make profit and forget about me just like last time when I gave you shittards perfect trades. (virginG, BB, vale...)

How much to buy? Whatever your buying power is. If you are a pussy get 50-100-200... whatever you want to risk.

For those who gain a lot please make sure to share these gains because its not yours its mine! Donate food to poor people or buy your wifes boyfriend something nice. In all honesty give an amount you are okay with to someone less fortunate otherwise I will be fucking pissed 

And do not doubt me it will moon you will profit just wait wait wait and let this bitch run I know yall dumb cutting losses too late and taking profits too early... dm me when you want to take profits but not sure whether there is upwards potential. Dont dm me before that I do not care about you and wont give you any advice on anything 

Lastly the best way to buy for those low IQ bitches here with FOMO it wont jump 200% in a day. It you want to get 500 shares buy 100 every day for 5 days. This way you retard wont buy right at the fucking top like You do most of the Time.

Title: Desktop Metal (DM) gonna moon ?
At first I like the name of this company. Then I did some DD. Here it is

1.Desktop Metal is the only company that provide 100x rapid and mass production - 3D metal and carbin fiber printed product (called the production system P50) which going to replace traditional CNC machine 

2.Desktop Metal's product has highest resolution : 1200x1200 dpi with highest tensile modulus 140GPa and 2500MPa tensile strength (2000x stronger than traditional FFF material)

3.Not only Ford, BMW, Toyota but also Google partnership with them

4. Current cumulative gross margin is &gt;48%. Management team said projected to be &gt;54% in 4 yrs (to give you perspective Tesla c gross margin is around 5%)

5. 625m Cash sitting on their balance sheet after merger with TRNE spac. However, currently DMs valuation is only 700m ish. So way undervalued.

6. The AM industrial grew at a 20 percent annual compound rate between 2006 and 2016 before accelerating to 25 percent compound annual growth over the last three years

7. Bunch of MIT profs sit on the board (those are the people who first invented metal 3D printing)

8. Named the world's top 50 smartest company by MIT Technology Review



TLDR; I believe they can produce Terminators to save humanity one day

Title: $AWK
 

AWK is a company that supplies drinking water to lots of municipalities. If you guys saw the recent article on Bloomberg, youll realize how important water is for the future: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-06/water-futures-to-start-trading-amid-growing-fears-of-scarcity](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-06/water-futures-to-start-trading-amid-growing-fears-of-scarcity)

This company has operating margin of 33% and net margins of 17%, which is higher than 80% of the companies in its field. It is in a great financial position, and has no trouble raising debt to finance its expansion, as everyone will lend to them. They are continuing to grow year over year. 

COVID has hurt some of this companies revenues, as a lot of the industrial sector had to shut down and they didnt use as much water. Now that things are beginning to open back up, this could also be an opening up play as well. 

The implied volatility for these options are also very low compared to its historical volatility. The current IV is sitting at 24%. This means that the underlying stock doesnt move as much, however when it does move because the options are so cheap, realized volatility can become greater than implied volatility, causing your options to go high. A lot of the tech stocks have insane IVs, and its getting harder and harder for the realized volatility to be greater than the implied volatility. (Although it does happen  see TSLA). 

This company will not be a 5 bagger. However because the IV is so cheap, and the fact that historical vol is 32% and current vol is 24.7%, the options are dirt cheap, and you can easily get a 80-100% if the stock rallies 6% on far dated contracts.

Overall, this is just a low risk option play and stock. This is a company with great fundamentals and isnt going anywhere anytime soon. They are continuing to grow, and will become more important as time goes on.

Title: Gamestop (GME) can run a whole lot more
As I'm sure most of you already know, Gamestop delivered a huge earnings beat last quarter even with a large revenue decline. Yes, yes the 16% comps increase in November is nothing phenomenal relative to Black Friday and PS5 hype. But think about it: that most likely does not factor in the delayed title releases. They can do much better this month holiday sales are not over yet!!!! Their market cap is less than 25 percent of their revenue... I think there's much more upside to see here.

Title: Puts on CTXS - Citrix
This may be hard to believe in this market but Citrix - CTXS looks like it has completed a major top between March and October, peaking at $173.  It sold off bigly below the 200 day moving average to $111.  Since the big sell off it has rallied for the past month up to $133 and still cant get up over the MA and neckline.  As of Friday it started getting dumped again.  I dont know whats wrong with this stock but it looks like the holders hate it now and its going down.  Maybe some institutional holders getting out?

Right now is a high reward to risk ratio to enter puts or shorts.

My position: $115 put March 19 2021

Title: GIK - The company that delivered more commercial electric vehicles in the US than Ford and Daimler combined
We have seen about a dozen EV companies this year to go public, but this one is different. Most of this companies like Fisker entirely base their valuation on projected revenue estimates and have not a single unit sold and driving out on the streets.

Lightning eMotors has delivered more commercial electric vehicles this year in the US than [Ford and Daimler combined](https://twitter.com/LightningeMtrs/status/1332377396192837632).

**Lightnings customers are Amazon, DHL, Ikea, Keurig/Dr.Pepper** and many more who buy their electric delivery vans as you can see in the [investor presentation](https://www.gigcapitalglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/Project-Power-Announcement-Deck_vF.pdf). This might not seem like a big deal, but it is. Lightning eMotors actually already does today what many other companies claim to be able to do in a couple years if everything goes by plan. They have many large orders lined up as well and sold over 1,500 units in the last few months alone. Lightning said in October that it had more than doubled its manufacturing space, ramped up production and that it had doubled its workforce.

Additionally to the delivery vans they are also making [larger trucks](https://lightningemotors.com/lightningelectric-chevrolet-6500xd/) as well as [buses](https://lightningemotors.com/buses/). With Biden as a president we will see a heavy demand for this type of electrified vehicles and a lot of states will roll out their own programs to subsidize companies which invest into electric vehicles. And they also develop and distribute their own charging infrastructure like Chargepoint: [https://lightningenergy.biz/dc-charging-stations](https://lightningenergy.biz/dc-charging-stations)

This is the only company which provides everything for commercial customers to quickly electrify large fleets and to run them cost efficient and reliable. They are backed by big oil, BP invested $40 million in them. In the US alone there were [12.4 million commercial vehicles sold in 2019](https://www.statista.com/statistics/265914/commercial-vehicle-sales-in-the-united-states/).

This is a HUGE untapped market which isn't addressed by Tesla yet, and there already is more demand for electric delivery vans [than can be fulfilled](https://www.autoblog.com/2020/09/09/electric-delivery-vans-high-demand).

Don't make the mistake to think that all of these EV companies are garbage because some like NKxx are. This seems to be one of the few like Chargepoint which actually have their shit together.

**The best thing about GIK/Lightning:**

The valuation of Lightning eMotors is just 0.8 billion.

NK\*\* currently trades at 7 billion.

PIC/XLfleet currently trading at 2.4 billion.

Hyliion at 2.7 billion.

CIIC/Arrival at 15 billion.

I posted about SBE/Chargepoint when it was trading at $12 and I was right: [proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iyu629/sbe_could_be_the_next_spi_biggest_ev_charging/). This is my next big EV play and I am confident it will work out just as great as my last one did.

GIK already traded at $16 in pre-market but lost a little of its gains on Friday as all EV stocks had a slight sell off. I am confident this will go back to $16 by Monday and might even see $20 next week.

**Position:**

5,000 shares, 1,000 warrants

Title: Once More Unto the Breach: The Unified Field Hypothesis of PSTH + Stripe (or possibly, the paranoiac ramblings of an undermedicated madman), Part 2
Mis compas, mis amigos y amigas, fellow autists and retards of WSB,

I return to you now with the second installation of my Big Crazy Idea about why Bill Ackman's SPAC, Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, and what is shaping up to be the most important company for the economic development of the internet, Stripe, could be teaming up to take steps in order to wrest back control of the financial system from the veritable freak show of private equity and investment banking, which I will collectively refer to as Big Capital. The previous post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kbjpqy/an_alternative_hypothesis_for_psth_stripe_for_the/) and serves as an introductory foray into institutional financial crime. If you thought that one was long, strap the fuck in, because we're going deep into the muck with our third eyes wide open.

#Big Capital, Big Crime, and Rivers of Blood

This section will attempt to provide some historical context on the history of Big Capital with a particular focus on the inextricable links between intelligence agencies (mainly the Central Intelligence Agency and its predecessor, the Office of Strategic Services) and Wall Street, starting around the time of World War II. It will lean heavily on the work of Michael S. Judge, whose podcast [Death is Just Around the Corner](https://www.patreon.com/deathcorner/) has become an integral part of my understanding of the nature of American imperialism, which has been largely scrubbed from the history books. It will also draw from excellent books including but not limited to Vincent Bevins' [The Jakarta Method](https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/vincent-bevins/the-jakarta-method/9781541724013/) and Stephen Kinzer's [The Brothers](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250053121) and [Poisoner in Chief](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250140432). In the interest of accessibility, I will be supplying Wikipedia articles for further reading, but with the caveat that [Wikipedia itself cowtows to the American imperial project](https://thegrayzone.com/2020/06/10/wikipedia-formally-censors-the-grayzone-as-regime-change-advocates-monopolize-editing/) and **should not be taken as an authoritative account of history.**

I think the best place to start this story is with Allen Dulles, the longest serving director of the CIA, and his brother John Foster Dulles, who was Dwight Eisenhower's Secretary of State. Before joining the federal government, the Dulles brothers worked for [United Fruit Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Fruit_Company), which is now known as Chiquita Brands International (yes, the  company), where John served as legal counsel and Allen was on the board of directors. The United Fruit Company was a key driver of the CIA-led [1954 Guatemalan coup that ousted the democratically elected Jacobo Arbenz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) and replaced him with the dictator Carlos Castillo Armas, which will be a recurring theme in this missive. Put a pin in this for now, because we have to backtrack a little further first.

It is critical to understand that the CIA and the agencies that came before it, are deeply rooted in the boy's club of Wall Street from the years between World War I and World War II, and that pipeline catapulted people like [Prescott Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott_Bush) (father of George H.W. Bush and grandfather of George W. Bush) to the highest levels of the American government. Most of these roaches skittered out of investment banks like [Brown Brothers Harriman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Brothers_Harriman_%26_Co.) or law firms like [Sullivan &amp; Cromwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sullivan_%26_Cromwell), both institutions that still stand to this day.

Prescott Bush and the Dulles brothers were up to some real sketchy shit before, during, and after WWII, [having business ties to German industrialists that helped finance Hitler's rise to power and helping Nazis launder money and transport looted art and valuables through European banks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/25/usa.secondworldwar). Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg even went so far to say that ["The Dulles brothers were traitors."](http://libcom.org/library/making-killing-christian-dewar) Prescott and the Dulles brothers were probably not literally card-carrying Nazis, but the model of fusing big business and central government, which the CIA was based on and adheres to up to this very day, [**is explicitly fascist when going off of the dictionary definition of the word**](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fascism) (read: not using it as a proxy for "person I disagree with politically" as it's so often used today). Did you know that the CIA has an active venture capital operation called [In-Q-Tel](https://www.iqt.org/) and that Palantir's only early investor besides Peter Thiel was [one and the same](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/21/magazine/palantir-alex-karp.html)? Now you do.

In the last days and immediate aftermath of WWII, the intelligence agencies spearheaded an effort by the US government called [Operation Paperclip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip), which was designed to save Nazi and Japanese scientists from the gallows and put them to work developing weapons programs in the US. [Wernher von Braun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun), chief architect of the Saturn V  that sent Apollo to the ? Operation Paperclip. [Shiro Ishii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shir%C5%8D_Ishii), a man who was loading grenades full of plague bacteria and sewing babies together and shit in Manchukuo (Japanese-occupied China)? Operation Paperclip.

At this point in the story, WWII is over and the USSR has become the Big Bad Mans of the time period from 1945 to 1991 that we collectively refer to as the Cold War. Unfortunately, the Cold War was not actually very cold, and instead took the shape of a seemingly endless series of proxy wars and regime change operations led by Western intelligence agencies attempting, with various degrees of success, to overthrow democratically elected leftists and appoint authoritarian leaders with the backing of weapons and money from the CIA. This is not an exhaustive list, but includes examples like the [1953 Iranian coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) that overthrew Mohammad Mosaddegh and replaced him with Shah Pahlavi, the aforementioned 1954 Guatemalan coup, the [mass killings in Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_mass_killings_of_1965%E2%80%9366) that ultimately resulted in the removal of Sukarno and a 31 year military junta under Suharto, the [1973 Chilean coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) that brought Augusto Pinochet to power, and both the [Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War) and [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War) Wars, in which the greatest military in the world was epically pwned by a bunch of starving jungle fighters using slingshots and AK-47s.

The underlying reason for a lot of this carnage, besides the stated goal of beating back the spectre of communism or whatever the fuck? Resources. Iran had oil, Chile had nationalized the copper mines that Big Capital needed to fuel the electronics boom, and both the [Golden Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Triangle_\(Southeast_Asia\)) and [Golden Crescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Crescent) were fertile ground for growing opium, which was used to make the heroin the CIA trafficked all over the world and sold to buy weapons that they then gave to the dictators they propped up, sometimes [using the bodies of dead soldiers as mules](https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/17/archives/drug-feared-sent-in-bodies-of-gis-court-told-that-smugglers-used.html). 

Does any of this sound familiar and related to the current day? How about the overthrow of [Evo Morales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Bolivian_protests) in Bolivia, which was applauded by [Elon Musk](https://imgur.com/XCsXNTJ), who wants cheap access to their copper mines so he can make batteries for his shitty cars? How about the Forever War in the Middle East, which has effectively turned [Afghanistan into a narco-state?](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/09/how-the-heroin-trade-explains-the-us-uk-failure-in-afghanistan) How about the endless revolving door between the Pentagon, defense contractors, and the rest of the federal government, as exemplified most recently by the nomination of [Raytheon board member General Lloyd Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Austin) to be Joe Biden's Secretary of Defense? That's right, you blue-pilled goldfish, the Democrats are not your friends either.

#The Stripe and PSTH Angles

Alright, enough psychic assault for the moment. Let's talk about Stripe for a bit. As stated previously, Stripe is building the infrastructure that the internet economy runs on. The Collison brothers, those cheeky little leprechauns, seem like they're wired pretty differently than most of the money grubbing bug people that inhabit Silicon Valley. [Take this clip of co-founder and CEO Patrick Collison](https://youtu.be/knXY3Rwtfww?t=1495) talking about the nature of motivation (listen through to ~27:20 at least). [Or this one of co-founder and president John Collison](https://youtu.be/N_W62v3RYwc?t=239) talking about the need to support small businesses who have been reamed by the pandemic and build Stripe bigger and better as a service to the small fish in the ocean (listen through to the end on this one).

Bill Ackman is a signatory on the [Giving Pledge](https://givingpledge.org/Pledger.aspx?id=157), and as discussed in the previous post, is also not your typical Wall Street swamp monster. He remarried last year and has a kid that's a little over a year old by this point. He deeply understands that the finance game is rigged against the little guys, that Big Capital has wrapped its disgusting slimy tentacles all over the world, and is choking more life out of it every single day. Could it be that he wants to do whatever he can to stop the world his kid will grow up in from devolving further into some kind of [Mad Max](https://imgur.com/HTpAmLG) scenario?

[The order of operations for how PSTH is structured is flipped on its head](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/22/bill-ackman-and-tontine-holdings-rewrite-the-terms-for-spacs.html) from the way previous SPACs have been run by institutions like Goldman Sachs (remember, we hate them) with regard to sponsor compensation. Pershing Square isn't taking a thing until the investors in the SPAC see a 20% return, whereas most SPACs include clauses allowing the sponsors to snatch cheap warrants with their grubby little hands because they are run by unapologetic money pigs.

#An Aside About Cyptocurrency

I, like most of you, am way too stupid to understand how the fuck cypto actually works on a fundamental level, but I think it's pretty clear that the reason it has value at all is as a hedge against total economic societal collapse like we've been seeing most recently in places like Venezuela, which underwent inflation to the tune of nearly [***54 million percent***](https://venezuelaaldia.com/2019/05/28/banco-central-venezuela-hiperinflacion-2016/) between 2016 and 2019. Hey, what the fuck is that Juan Guiado guy up to? Oh, [he's a CIA sock puppet](https://thegrayzone.com/2019/01/29/the-making-of-juan-guaido-how-the-us-regime-change-laboratory-created-venezuelas-coup-leader/).

It is interesting to note that Stripe used to support cypto but eliminated that functionality, at least directly, back in [2018](https://imgur.com/crnp9iJ). Patrick Collison used to talk about cypto frequently and would say things like [this](https://imgur.com/OSbi8uz) (take note of the date) but has been largely silent on the issue for years. I think it's possible that he and his brother have come around to thinking that while cypto is a heady big brain idea, it's too inaccessible for dummies like you and me, who just want to buy a cup of coffee without paying $20 in transaction fees. They could be trying to build a vanguard that would make such a thing unnecessary for a functioning society, a system that continues to run on dollars, euros, yen, and yuan. 

That, and the original idea for cypto came from [another part of the bowels of the Deep State, the NSA](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/money/nsamint/nsamint.htm). You know, that thing Edward Snowden revealed as spying on everyone all the time with the support of [the tech giants](https://imgur.com/buIPP1S), but we're mostly all cool with because hey, cat videos and free porn!

I do have some suspicions about Snowden, being a former CIA contractor and all, and his insistence that privacy-minded folks use Tor, which is and always has been a [project of the Department of Defense and intelligence agencies](https://www.wired.com/story/cia-sets-up-shop-on-tor/). If you, like me, used cypto to buy drugs on the dark net back in the heady days of 2015 when they were basically crime bucks, you're also probably on a watchlist somewhere at Langley.

#Conclusion

If you've reached this point without your eyes rolling back in your head and starting to drool, I sincerely applaud you . I hope that you've learned something new and are now thinking about what bigger brains than you and I have, like those of Bill Ackman and the Collisons, could be trying to put out there in the world, if a PSTH + Stripe union is truly in the cards.

I do find it quite interesting to look at the list of [Restricted Businesses](https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses) at Stripe. It includes a lot of things that Ackman has historically and more recently placed in his sights as the targets of his wrath, like multi-level marketing schemes and pseudopharmaceuticals (Herbalife) and pornography (Pornhub versus the credit card companies). There's also things you can extrapolate outward from if you want to get real wacky and use looser definitions, like "gambling" and "get rich quick schemes" (i.e. Robinhood).

Thank you for reading my brain ejaculation, and always remember: Big Brother is watching you.


**TLDR: Reining in the types of financial crime that have created this fucked up world we're all stuck in is imperative to building a future that is better and more equitable for people all around the world, not just in the United States. A merger of Stripe with PSTH could represent a gigantic leap forward for driving a sword into the heart of the beast of Big Capital. You could get in now instead of the alternative that the traditional IPO process provides, where the big institutions get the first crack at everything and leave table scraps for the rest of us to fight over.

Title: Tak
Alright so takeda is going to produce the NVXCoV2373 vaccine made by novavax in Japan. Tak is backed by mhlw Japanese cdc to do this. NVXCoV2373 phase 3 trials in the uk are about to end. Phase 3 in US are about to start. Supposedly this vaccine shits on Pfizers and modernas and doesnt require -9000 temps. 


Takeda will have the capacity to produce 250 million doses in Japan a year = billions of tendies.

Title: $ZNGA
Alright listen up you autistic gambling fiends, do we remember Zynga, the mobile game developer? Yeah, them. Their current share price is $8.69 and its 52-week high is $10.69.
Now if those numbers arent enough for you to YOLO all your life savings in otm calls, then I have more numbers for you:
Their average sales growth over the past 3 years is 32%
Their sales for 2020 make up almost 22% of their market cap, which is way greater than the 10% benchmark for tech companies and game developers.
Needless to say these guys are PROFITABLE too..

The mobile game industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.8% which is not super impressive but these guys are going to dominate that market as they have been acquiring major competitors all year (Peak, Rollic, etc).

alright listen up simps, if you're tired of chasing pltr, gme, and camgirls, here's something better to throw your parent's hard earned money at: HZON

HZON or Horizon Acquisition Corp is a SPAC led by Todd Boehly(5 billion dollar net worth, owns the LA Dodgers), Ex-Netflix VP of 20 years Cindy Holland, and DKNG CEO Jason Robins.

they just launched recently and now's your fucking chance to get in near NAV. NAV literally means it can't go tits up. don't believe me? read a book you fucking retard

as you can see, they're targeting a merge with a business in the media and entertainment live-streaming industry. what's the only real viable option here? onlyfans. 

but op, you say, why would i want to buy stock for a camgirl site? well \[according to bloomberg\]([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-05/celebrities-like-cardi-b-could-turn-onlyfans-into-a-billion-dollar-media-company?utm\_content=business&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm\_source=twitter&amp;utm\_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm\_medium=social](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-05/celebrities-like-cardi-b-could-turn-onlyfans-into-a-billion-dollar-media-company?utm_content=business&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_medium=social)) onlyfans will generate over 2 billion dollars in revenue this year. also, everybody knows about it so this shit will fucking moon harder than a 13 year old's dick that just paid for belle delphine's onlyfans

tl;dr hzon will very possibly merge with onlyfans, get the fuck in here before it takes off

Title: The distribution begins: what to do.
So this morning the vaccine shipments finally parted out of the Pfizer distribution center in Michigan. Theyre calling for 145 sites to have it Monday, 425 sites to have it Tuesday, and 66 others to get it Wednesday. Yes thats only 636 sites, but thats a only from the first shipment. 

Front line workers in medical fields are going to be receiving the vaccine first, then essential workers, then the elderly, then you and everyone else. Since this is the order laid out, hospitals will be getting virtually all the vaccines at first, then organizations to administer it to the elderly. Due to this, I think some people will be disappointed in the volume going to CVS, so I might sit out of making that play for a bit. 

UPS and FedEx are going to be spearheading the distribution, two companies that I am skeptical to make any plays on as it seems theyve already rallied in anticipation of this, but a short term play could be a possibility. 

Airlines will be the big winner in the long term. Right now Delta, United, and American will be transporting the vaccine in designated planes. The downfall with this is that vaccines cannot be carried on the same planes as passengers. Transporting the -94 degrees coolers will require dry ice and is a cabin health hazard. Regardless, this is a huge sentiment booster for airlines and will allow them to get planes off the ground. 

As sentiment increases over airlines it will be a great time to get in as the next step will be transitioning from vaccines to actual passengers. In my opinion I see this as a super easy way to get ahead of the news. We know the headline is coming, just buy in and wait. 

Next, I am also skeptical about cruise lines. I am seriously willing to bet most people will not want to go on a cruise as their first activity post vaccination. Cheaper and quicker forms of entertainment that also allow for social interaction will be the best play, these include concert venues and bars or restaurants. 

To play this I have already loaded on live nation and will soon be buying into beverage companies. Vender purchases make up a large majority of beverage company sales and as bars and restaurants open again, these vendors will go back to making their usually purchases. It doesnt matter what bar or restaurant closed or went out of business during this year, suppliers didnt and will be receiving large orders when everyone takes their shot at starting up a new bar when things open. 

These are my positions but look into anything similar:
$LYV- ton of shares 
$UAL- ton of shares 
$BUD- some shares 
$CBRE- some shares

Title: CNBC:  I think this one could triple. $BFT
You may have noticed an unexpected 10% spike on BFT after hours Friday (after it ran as high as 8% higher during regular trading). This spike came from no other than our boy Steve Grasso from Fast Money on CNBC. Steve said, I like to give you stocks that could double. I think this one could triple. 

Now.. if I had your curiosity and now have your attention, feel free to keep reading below. 

BFT is a SPAC. If youve been living in a cave and didnt have internet access to waste your life on WSB, a SPAC is a company created for the sole purpose of taking another company public. Its a newer technique that has proven to be a much quicker way to get your company a ticker. 

The company that will be getting a shinny new ticker is Paysafe. Paysafe is a multinational online payment system. Founded in 1996 and headquartered in London. Their largest marketshare is in Europe and are highly dominate in the gambling industry.  

Paysafe

Financials: $1.5 billion in revenue. $468 mil EBITDA profit. Net profit of $142 million. 

Customers: Paysafe is attached to very big names, in lots of sectors. Just a few are: Draftkings, Twitch, YouTube, Fortnite, Henri, Spotify, Staida, NH lottery. 

Key facts to note:

1. Process over $100 billion per year. 
2. Jacked to the tits on diversification. From a large global presence, to a huge foothold in several key sectors. This has helped them a ton during Corona when so many others have faltered, they have remained steady.  
3. Actually profitable, which is very rare for SPACS. 
4. Its major competitors (i.e. PayPal, Square, Venmo etc.) arent willing to move into gambling where Paysafe is dominating.  

I dont want to hear any, Why didnt you tell me 18 years ago when the stock was a penny. The price went up so it can never go up again. This baby was just confirmed last week and is just starting to make it on major news networks. You will start to see more than just CNBC talking about it as its one of the largest SPACS of the year, and I would challenge any of them to not recommend it as a buy. If we get a huge name to give it a thumbs up we will see a corresponding huge pump during the next open. 
Big Fucking Titties. 4 rocket ship emojis

I also want to add u/dhsmatt2 review as I think its the most thorough on WSB.

Title: 230k bet on BFT - Fintech and why this stock is the next 
I'm going to keep this short and sweet for you guys. 

BFT is merging with the company PaySafe. This a legitimate company.

Highlights for PaySafe- 

In business for over twenty years. This is a processing payment company that focuses on creating a niche in the gambling and iGaming industry. Notable customers include Twitch, Fortnite, Roblox,Stadia, Spotify, Draftkings, and various other lotteries. They also acquired Skrill which allows payment processing using currencies that cannot be named here.

If you want to read more about BFT here's a post from u/dhsmatt2 [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaabxa/700000\_bet\_on\_fintech\_bft/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaabxa/700000_bet_on_fintech_bft/)

The bottom line is this company is sound, it is not a pump and dump.

Enough of the fundamental stuff, because let's be honest - none of that matters anymore. Here are the most recent developments which are going to cause this stock moon:

This stock is part of the Fintech sector. The three big sectors that see the greatest rise in price movement are EV, Fintech, and Tech stocks.

This stock has had the HIGHEST VOLUME FOR 5 DAYS of any SPAC. How do I know? Because I track it and post it everyday, check my profile. This is likely because large institutions are accumulating shares and this will be reported/leaked in coming weeks which will further drive up the price. This SPAC has a floor of around 10, but given the significant accumulation around 12-13 there is significant support at this area.

This stock is already being mentioned on CNBC (twice last week). When the boomers and WSB both agree that a stock is a solid investment, there's likely to be a large increase in price.

Other notable mentions include a significant increase of Stocktwits followers - increased by 30% this weekend but still under 15k. There have also been 5 YouTube videos just today.

Lastly here's my position - Original 200k bet - now worth 230k.

&amp;#x200B;

[](https://preview.redd.it/kt3pyoav01561.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b81daff7d84b2b717d97ac7571e3dd9b39418e3e)

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: This SPAC's acquisition is the right sector, the right time, with a traditional and social media following to make this potentially the next mega stock. NAV is 10, likely large institutional buying creating significant support around 13.  You don't want to miss out as Monday morning might be the last chance.

Title: PYPL/SQ/ARKF fintech DD
Paypal was an early COVID investing pick due to its nature of contactless payments and its rise in young populations with Venmo. Paypal has a storied history, founded by some of the most influential Silicon Valley VCs and entrepreneurs they started as two smaller companies founded in the middle of the tech bubble (1998 and 1999) as Confinity and X.com by Peter Thiel and Elon Musk. They were able to weather the storm of the 2000 tech fallout by being bought out by eBay for $1.5B beforehand. Under eBay, Paypal grew their services into what most of us know them for: digitized payments. Starting from effortless check transfers for unauthorized vendors to working their way to B(!)tcoin, Paypal has made it more convenient for payments to be processed, and in our consumerist economy thats an absolute goldmine. Square is a relatively new player in the digital transaction space but theyve had quite a run up this year under the leadership of Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter. Their first product was a card reader that fit into the headphone jack of smartphones, so naturally Square expanded into the enterprise services market and continued developing solutions for small businesses like payroll management. Ill further discuss the respective structures of both companies in this due diligence

**The Expansion of Digital Transactions**

Paper currency has been the standard means of exchange for ages, but the digital method of exchange, particularly mobile exchanges has now become far more convenient. In 2017, digital payments were expected to reach a market value of [$726B](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/09/digital-payments-expected-to-hit-726-billion-by-2020-study-finds.html) in 2020, and here we are post covid with the value of digital payments at over 910B.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mr9elex5z0561.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18e6eb1b9039d738af6c2ea5277018d2749cbbfd

Statista forecasts that most of the sales growth for digitized payments past 2020 will come from mobile POS, and that most of the user growth for digitized payments will also be in peer-to-peer transactions. Paypal has both bases covered with Venmo when it comes to mobile transactions and it has E-Commerce covered with its major retailer partnerships and with eBay. Square has Cash app, which is a peer-to-peer payments app plus they also have in-person small business products for digital payments like their cash register called the Square Stand which is useful for freelancing professionals and small businesses.

So a pro of Square is that it has a far more established presence in the growing sector of digital payments which is mobile POS payments, not E-Commerce. However, E-Commerce is the much larger sector by users alone:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x99o8v39z0561.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c12fa73d91b1948acec47fe715cdefe8b4bfb3bb

### As you can see, mobile POS payments are expected to triple in the same time that E-commerce will grow by around20%.

This makes a lot of sense to me as E-Commerce still makes up a small amount of all transactions and its trajectory is very much fixed and established now. POS payments are definitely growing though, as on my last trip to India, one of the fastest growing countries, I observed that every small business had a PayTM barcode for transactions, and this is where both Paypal and especially Square will eventually expand to. CNBC also forecasts most digital payment growth will happen in emerging markets (which is why Ill suggest an ETF at the end which incorporates emerging market companies) Emerging markets are expected to grow at a rate three times that of developed economies in terms of digital transaction volumes. Digital payments in developing markets grew 21.6 percent between 2014 and 2015, compared to a 6.8 percent rise in mature markets. Non-cash payments in Asian emerging markets are projected to grow by almost a third (30.9 percent), led by powerhouses China and India. According to CNBC analysts though, cash will still remain supreme for the following reasons: speed of exchange, universal acceptance, anonymity, absence of record and free of charge. Anonymity and absence of record are things that are being fixed by the incorporation of cr(!)ptocurrency into transactions, but its likely the biggest reason people dont switch to cashless is because not all merchants use it and the fees add up especially for many transactions a day for the *merchants*. Eventually when the digital transaction economy grows fully, there will be enough competitors to offer sellers competitive rates to a point where theyll choose mobile payments for the convenience it provides in terms of not having to use physical cash but as of now only small businesses are willing to make the opportunity cost of losing fees so they dont have to store cash.

***Paypal***

Paypal is a global, two-sided network at scale that connects merchants and consumers with 305 million active accounts (consisting of 281 million consumer active accounts and 24 million merchant active accounts) across more than 200 markets. PayPal helps merchants and consumers connect, transact, and complete payments, whether they are online, on a mobile device, in an app, or in person. They have a variety of new products in development as they have made several acquisitions since their establishment. Paypal offers merchants a technology-agnostic platform that requires no hardware and little time to set up with its Braintree product which is primarily for online sellers and iZettle which is used for POS payments primarily in international markets and they have a user base of 19 million. This acquisition was made with the full intention of competing with Square and since Paypal has had an extremely talented eye for acquisitions in the past in Xoom and Venmo, this [relatively new acquisition](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2018/06/07/why-did-paypal-pay-such-a-high-price-for-izettle/?sh=60f035216860) has a lot of potential, but it could also just be a last minute scramble to catch up to Squares huge market share in POS payment offerings. Paypal has a great P2P ecosystem in Venmo and Xoom and a credit partnership with Synchrony bank as well which helps diversify revenue streams. Paypal also owns a company called GoPay, which basically provides the same services Paypal does but in China, which expands them into a market thats more likely to grow in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w3vmknzbz0561.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23c083f35611ffa86a997cf3a9f75a7c29de7a9f

As you can see, Paypal has some pretty consistent revenue, profit, and EBITDA growth, but a bit more concerning may be the fact that margins have been relatively stable and they havent been increasing at all. I believe the reason for this is because PayPals full potential isnt close to being realized, and even founder Peter Thiel said in his book Zero to One that Paypal wouldnt start realizing a majority of their cash flows until 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/78wifzfdz0561.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bce649ad199031a1c5ddbfbdb663324b7ae3454

&amp;#x200B;

While Paypal was able to increase earnings per share by a strong 21% from 2018 to 2019, they decreased cash flows from operating activities by 17% from 2018. This requires that we go into the capital expenditures in their CF statement, which will provide a clearer idea of why and how Paypal lost cash flow despite rising net income. Another thing standing out may be the fact that the operating margin is pretty constant, which can be a concerning sign for investors seeking a growth stock. Plus, considering how much the price for PYPL has run up in the past few months youd expect better profitability to come with it hand-in-hand. But the future being factored into Paypal isnt based on its face value, or else the price would be very stagnant right now and it wouldnt have grown nearly as much as it has.

Heres what I mean:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/47r8msvez0561.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cefbcab0e52e1a1ca9e42b946f569f4a1595785

The amount of profit Paypal can squeeze out of its main product is pretty much at a maximum as transaction expenses are growing at the same rate as revenues are and operating expenses are still going up at a somewhat proportional rate to that of net income, meaning that no more value is going to come out of the existing product. While the existing product is still going to grow in popularity, its profitability is only going to decrease or stagnate as Paypal expands into developing markets that arent willing to cough up as much in fees. As Thiel himself puts it, thats horizontal innovation AKA just globalism. That alone isnt enough to justify the investment levels in Paypal, but investments and acquisitions into the future of transactions will expand it, and on top of this it is only recently Paypal has experienced such tremendous growth in cash flows YoY.

Now youll see below PYPLs historic cash flows, and if you go to the bottom youll see their free cash flow decreased from 2018 to 2019 as I previously mentioned. The root cause of this is investment purchases, which increased by $5B in 2019 and contributed to the Free Cash Flow decreasing by 800M. Again, if we look at Paypals track record when it comes to acquisitions theyve been very successful, so theres not much reason to expect much different this time around. If Paypals investing, investors are excited. Theyve piled up cash up until last year, and theyre finally using it now based off their cash per share:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rq6x4g8kz0561.png?width=387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=976d294dbc9ceb68d288570648b9a894fde8c1ac

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jh21m90lz0561.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b77b71f08785127aea6cad5afa30e6ff37f78f11

Add to this the tremendous increase in digital payment volume in the past year and we can expect a real change in the entire sectors trajectory. Hedge funds have been piling up on this supposed legacy company for a valid reason: their time for expansion is ***now, and COVID-19 has only spurred in realizing this perfect storm, as net income and revenue has seen a jump in the past two quarters:***

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v4cgyl1nz0561.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=272965de645fa1a9aac0ff763863cc28e7942035

So you must be wondering why Paypals cash from operations was down in 2019 from 2018, but in their most recent 10k Paypal explained cash from operations and free cash flow was only down due to positive impact of $1.4 billion of changes in loans and interest receivable, held for sale, net following the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio which was added into the operating income as it was a noncash expense and thats why 2019 looks down about $1B in cash even though operating income for 2019 was up $0.4B:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7i979ldoz0561.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=798113837df594aa112574facc98df32685c8c79

Paypals newly acquired capital is already being used and itll be put to good use based on the meteoric rise in transactions in the past two years. Contactless payments will eventually become a norm and their established e-commerce platform will set them up pretty well on this end.

Now to address the flip side of the coin: POS or Point of Sale transactions, which is a market Square has wrapped around its finger as its had the head start since the iPhone 4. Heres how Square got started, instead of giving 10$ to people for using their product, founder and CEO Jack Dorsey (who also is the founder and CEO of Twitter) gave them the product for free and built an infrastructure around it. It was simply a credit card scanner that could be inserted into the headphone jack of a smartphone. This simple product is still being sent out for free to small businesses and the software and business model that surrounded this tiny card reader has expanded like a wildfire since then. Square would collect 2.75% on each payment similar to Paypal.

Square also made a cash management app, Cash App to dive into a non-retail market.

About Cash App: Cash App provides an ecosystem of financial products and services to help individuals manage their money. While Cash App started with the single ability to send and receive money, it now provides an ecosystem of financial services that allows individuals to store, send, receive, spend, and invest their money.

It appears as if Square is trying to become an all-round player in the consumer and producer financial ecosystem as Cash App has become more like a bank or brokerage account rather than just a P2P service like Paypal or Zelle. Now, Cash App makes 25% of SQs revenues.

In Squares 2019 annual report, they reported the following:

In the year ended December 31, 2019, we processed $106.2 billion of Gross Payment Volume (GPV), which was generated by nearly 2.3 billion card payments from 407 million payment cards. At the end of 2019, our Square point of sale ecosystem had over 180 million buyer profiles and approximately 230 million items were listed on Square by sellers.

As of December 2019, Cash App had approximately 24 million monthly active customers who had at least one cash inflow or outflow during a given month.

&amp;#x200B;

[The above image shows Squares payment volume distribution across different industries, and as you can see in 2019 payment volume was very diverse which bodes well for SQs stability.](https://preview.redd.it/rjjzniarz0561.png?width=371&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efe83afdb1c1d8adc38f4c37325fde9c1b125f93)

&amp;#x200B;

[This shows the increasing size of sellers who use Square, and this shows that Squares mission of making small businesses big and having them stick to their product regardless of their stage in growth is working.](https://preview.redd.it/cj0vx6gsz0561.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7f72e7dad5f7cbe846c489a90be6fa8d81067dd)

Although their main business is in processing payments, Square is making itself a fin-tech institutional force with 30 different APIs for retail and e-commerce sellers along with invoicing, appointment, payroll, loyalty/gift card, and account management services. Square also has financing for small businesses in Square Capital, which I find to be the most interesting part of their model. They give small loans to businesses based on the data that they ***already have as Square manages the business finances, remember? And this puts them at an advantage to make good debt because of the transparency into the business finances. This will allow Square to make extremely profitable and high turnover loans that have virtually NO risk of default***. The types of loans they give are generally small, and they could be as little as $500. They describe these loans as the type youd ask for from your parents or relatives. Square has such in-depth data from these businesses that when they make loans they dont even *consider* credit scores: Generally, for loans to Square sellers, loan repayment occurs automatically through a fixed percentage of every card transaction a seller takes. Loans are sized to be less than 20% of a sellers expected annual GPV (their payment volume) and, by simply running their business, sellers repay their loan in eight to nine months on average

Since 2014, Square has made over $6B in loans with a failure rate of only 4%, which makes sense because Square has access to all of its clients financials so therefore they possess the ability to make fully transparent loans.

When you jump into Squares financials, theres a lot of promise to say the least:

&amp;#x200B;

Not only has revenue grown by 42% from 2018 to 2019, net income finally became positive in 2019 and free cash flow increased from 232m to 400m in the same span.

Heres the revenue breakdown for Square, and as you can observe while transaction revenue saw much stronger compared to Paypal, the real deal was Squares expansion of its enterprise solutions as those revenues increased by 74% last year, these are revenues recognized as the following: Revenue from Cash App, Square Capital, and Instant Transfers for sellers currently comprise the majority of our subscription and services-based revenue. Cash App subscription and services-based revenue is primarily comprised of transaction fees from Cash App Instant Deposit and Cash Card. Our other subscription and services-based products include website hosting and domain name registration services, Gift Cards, Square Appointments, Customer Engagement, Employee Management, Payroll, Square Card, and other product offerings.

B(!)tcoin revenues from Cash App investing whose revenues increased by 210% (in this case B(!)tcoin is an asset that Square owns and sells to those using Cash App to invest in cr(!)ptocurrency.)

Also in that same span, Squares cash has nearly doubled. This liquidity will be necessary as Square Capital continues to grow and will require financing.

While Square is far riskier than Paypal, they seem to be capturing a much larger market and have a bigger vision for the future at this point. Paypal becomes more like Microsoft and Square is kind of like Apple if we went back 10 years. One of them has widespread use and an established platform but still has consistent growth (about 15%) and the other is finding itself in a competitive market but is also slowly establishing absolute dominance. Square is absolutely overvalued, but for a growth stock thats nothing out of the ordinary, and so is Paypal considering they dont have nearly as much a prospect for growth unless leadership shows a huge change in direction some time soon. The Paypal Mafia however has surprised us before and I think theres a solid chance of growth still plausible for them. Regardless, both of these companies should be a holding in your portfolio amidst a growing FinTech sector and a huge transition away from traditional payments.

ARKF 1/15/21 55c

Title: PYPL/SQ/ARKF DD
Paypal was an early COVID investing pick due to its nature of contactless payments and its rise in young populations with Venmo. Paypal has a storied history, founded by some of the most influential Silicon Valley VCs and entrepreneurs they started as two smaller companies founded in the middle of the tech bubble (1998 and 1999) as Confinity and X.com by Peter Thiel and Elon Musk. They were able to weather the storm of the 2000 tech fallout by being bought out by eBay for $1.5B beforehand. Under eBay, Paypal grew their services into what most of us know them for: digitized payments. Starting from effortless check transfers for unauthorized vendors to working their way to b(!)tcoin, Paypal has made it more convenient for payments to be processed, and in our consumerist economy thats an absolute goldmine. Square is a relatively new player in the digital transaction space but theyve had quite a run up this year under the leadership of Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter. Their first product was a card reader that fit into the headphone jack of smartphones, so naturally Square expanded into the enterprise services market and continued developing solutions for small businesses like payroll management. Ill further discuss the respective structures of both companies in this due diligence.

**The Expansion of Digital Transactions**

Paper currency has been the standard means of exchange for ages, but the digital method of exchange, particularly mobile exchanges has now become far more convenient. In 2017, digital payments were expected to reach a market value of [$726B](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/09/digital-payments-expected-to-hit-726-billion-by-2020-study-finds.html) in 2020, and here we are post covid with the value of digital payments at over 910B.

&amp;#x200B;

Statista forecasts that most of the sales growth for digitized payments past 2020 will come from mobile POS, and that most of the user growth for digitized payments will also be in peer-to-peer transactions. Paypal has both bases covered with Venmo when it comes to mobile transactions and it has E-Commerce covered with its major retailer partnerships and with eBay. Square has Cash app, which is a peer-to-peer payments app plus they also have in-person small business products for digital payments like their cash register called the Square Stand which is useful for freelancing professionals and small businesses:

&amp;#x200B;

So a pro of Square is that it has a far more established presence in the growing sector of digital payments which is mobile POS payments, not E-Commerce. However, E-Commerce is the much larger sector by users alone:

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, mobile POS payments are expected to triple in the same time that E-commerce will grow by around20%.

This makes a lot of sense to me as E-Commerce still makes up a small amount of all transactions and its trajectory is very much fixed and established now. POS payments are definitely growing though, as on my last trip to India, one of the fastest growing countries, I observed that every small business had a PayTM barcode for transactions, and this is where both Paypal and especially Square will eventually expand to. CNBC also forecasts most digital payment growth will happen in emerging markets (which is why Ill suggest an ETF at the end which incorporates emerging market companies) Emerging markets are expected to grow at a rate three times that of developed economies in terms of digital transaction volumes. Digital payments in developing markets grew 21.6 percent between 2014 and 2015, compared to a 6.8 percent rise in mature markets. Non-cash payments in Asian emerging markets are projected to grow by almost a third (30.9 percent), led by powerhouses China and India. According to CNBC analysts though, cash will still remain supreme for the following reasons: speed of exchange, universal acceptance, anonymity, absence of record and free of charge. Anonymity and absence of record are things that are being fixed by the incorporation of cr!ptocurrency into transactions, but its likely the biggest reason people dont switch to cashless is because not all merchants use it and the fees add up especially for many transactions a day for the *merchants*. Eventually when the digital transaction economy grows fully, there will be enough competitors to offer sellers competitive rates to a point where theyll choose mobile payments for the convenience it provides in terms of not having to use physical cash but as of now only small businesses are willing to make the opportunity cost of losing fees so they dont have to store cash.

***Paypal***

Paypal is a global, two-sided network at scale that connects merchants and consumers with 305 million active accounts (consisting of 281 million consumer active accounts and 24 million merchant active accounts) across more than 200 markets. PayPal helps merchants and consumers connect, transact, and complete payments, whether they are online, on a mobile device, in an app, or in person. They have a variety of new products in development as they have made several acquisitions since their establishment. Paypal offers merchants a technology-agnostic platform that requires no hardware and little time to set up with its Braintree product which is primarily for online sellers and iZettle which is used for POS payments primarily in international markets and they have a user base of 19 million. This acquisition was made with the full intention of competing with Square and since Paypal has had an extremely talented eye for acquisitions in the past in Xoom and Venmo, this [relatively new acquisition](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2018/06/07/why-did-paypal-pay-such-a-high-price-for-izettle/?sh=60f035216860) has a lot of potential, but it could also just be a last minute scramble to catch up to Squares huge market share in POS payment offerings. Paypal has a great P2P ecosystem in Venmo and Xoom and a credit partnership with Synchrony bank as well which helps diversify revenue streams. Paypal also owns a company called GoPay, which basically provides the same services Paypal does but in China, which expands them into a market thats more likely to grow in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, Paypal has some pretty consistent revenue, profit, and EBITDA growth, but a bit more concerning may be the fact that margins have been relatively stable and they havent been increasing at all. I believe the reason for this is because PayPals full potential isnt close to being realized, and even founder Peter Thiel said in his book Zero to One that Paypal wouldnt start realizing a majority of their cash flows until 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

While Paypal was able to increase earnings per share by a strong 21% from 2018 to 2019, they decreased cash flows from operating activities by 17% from 2018. This requires that we go into the capital expenditures in their CF statement, which will provide a clearer idea of why and how Paypal lost cash flow despite rising net income. Another thing standing out may be the fact that the operating margin is pretty constant, which can be a concerning sign for investors seeking a growth stock. Plus, considering how much the price for PYPL has run up in the past few months youd expect better profitability to come with it hand-in-hand. But the future being factored into Paypal isnt based on its face value, or else the price would be very stagnant right now and it wouldnt have grown nearly as much as it has.

Heres what I mean:

&amp;#x200B;

The amount of profit Paypal can squeeze out of its main product is pretty much at a maximum as transaction expenses are growing at the same rate as revenues are and operating expenses are still going up at a somewhat proportional rate to that of net income, meaning that no more value is going to come out of the existing product. While the existing product is still going to grow in popularity, its profitability is only going to decrease or stagnate as Paypal expands into developing markets that arent willing to cough up as much in fees. As Thiel himself puts it, thats horizontal innovation AKA just globalism. That alone isnt enough to justify the investment levels in Paypal, but investments and acquisitions into the future of transactions will expand it, and on top of this its only recently Paypal has experienced such tremendous growth in cash flows YoY.

Now youll see below PYPLs historic cash flows, and if you go to the bottom youll see their free cash flow decreased from 2018 to 2019 as I previously mentioned. The root cause of this is investment purchases, which increased by $5B in 2019 and contributed to the Free Cash Flow decreasing by 800M. Again, if we look at Paypals track record when it comes to acquisitions theyve been very successful, so theres not much reason to expect much different this time around. If Paypals investing, investors are excited. Theyve piled up cash up until last year, and theyre finally using it now based off their cash per share:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Add to this the tremendous increase in digital payment volume in the past year and we can expect a real change in the entire sectors trajectory. Hedge funds have been piling up on this supposed legacy company for a valid reason: their time for expansion is ***now, and COVID-19 has only spurred in realizing this perfect storm, as net income and revenue has seen a jump in the past two quarters:***

&amp;#x200B;

So you must be wondering why Paypals cash from operations was down in 2019 from 2018, but in their most recent 10k Paypal explained cash from operations and FCF was only down due to positive impact of $1.4 billion of changes in loans and interest receivable, held for sale, net following the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio which was added into the operating income as it was a noncash expense and thats why 2019 looks down about $1B in cash even though operating income for 2019 was up $0.4B:

&amp;#x200B;

Paypals newly acquired capital is already being used and itll be put to good use based on the meteoric rise in transactions in the past two years. Contactless payments will eventually become a norm and their established e-commerce platform will set them up pretty well on this end.

Now to address the flip side of the coin: POS or Point of Sale transactions, which is a market Square has wrapped around its finger as its had the head start since the iPhone 4. Heres how Square got started, instead of giving 10$ to people for using their product, founder and CEO Jack Dorsey (who also is the founder and CEO of Twitter) gave them the product for free and built an infrastructure around it. It was simply a credit card scanner that could be inserted into the headphone jack of a smartphone. This simple product is still being sent out for free to small businesses and the software and business model that surrounded this tiny card reader has expanded like a wildfire since then. Square would collect 2.75% on each payment similar to Paypal.

Square also made a cash management app, Cash App to dive into a non-retail market.

About Cash App: Cash App provides an ecosystem of financial products and services to help individuals manage their money. While Cash App started with the single ability to send and receive money, it now provides an ecosystem of financial services that allows individuals to store, send, receive, spend, and invest their money.

It appears as if Square is trying to become an all-round player in the consumer and producer financial ecosystem as Cash App has become more like a bank or brokerage account rather than just a P2P service like Paypal or Zelle. Now, Cash App makes 25% of SQs revenues.

In Squares 2019 annual report, they reported the following:

At the end of 2019, our Square point of sale ecosystem had over 180 million buyer profiles and approximately 230 million items were listed on Square by sellers.

As of December 2019, Cash App had approximately 24 million monthly active customers who had at least one cash inflow or outflow during a given month.

&amp;#x200B;

The above image shows Squares payment volume distribution across different industries, and as you can see in 2019 payment volume was very diverse which bodes well for SQs stability.

&amp;#x200B;

This shows the increasing size of sellers who use Square, and this shows that Squares mission of making small businesses big and having them stick to their product regardless of their stage in growth is ***working***.

Although their main business is in processing payments, Square is making itself a fin-tech institutional force with 30 different APIs for retail and e-commerce sellers along with invoicing, appointment, payroll, loyalty/gift card, and account management services. Square also has financing for small businesses in Square Capital, which I find to be the most interesting part of their model.

Title: The Week Ahead: Playing FOMC meeting amidst a bunch of other stuff happening (SPY, VXX, TLT)
**For months now, each meeting of the FED and Jerome Powell speech has stated the same things in varied terms:** 1) We are not raising interest rates 2) We really, really need a congressional stimulus and 3) Yes we are deep in our fucking bag, but we still got Qauntitiative Easing tools, so don't sleep

Given this repetitiveness of guidance, you'd assume the FOMC meetings to come are just boring ass affairs.  But, if you dig a little deeper into the nerdom, there are specific, subtle reasons this meeting in particular could have a huge affect on quantitative easing measures and the broader market, including SPY.

**Im particularly viewing this through the lens of Federal Reserve pushback to Treasury and Congress**. His rhetoric has been clear; we have done what we are going to do, for now, and the onus for a healthy economy is on the fiscal stimulus.  Our measures designed to be a temporary stopgap, not polic Yet the treasury and congress havent done their part. But his response choices do exist; and are more subtly complex than it may seem.  Let's take a journey through QE, and what the options are at the FOMC.

The first thing to understand is what the 2 popularized big guns of QE are, and that it is very, very unlikely we're going to see change to them.

**1) The lowering of the Federals funds rate**
*Current: ~0 (.25%, goal between 0 and .25%)*
*Last year this time: 1.75%*
**Any likely changes?** Hell no
Good news is that the Fed rate is obviously not increasing, as Powell has made it clear this isn't even on the table until 2023.  The other option--a negative federal interest rate--is also unlikely.  Not solely because of the fact that it's a tool to be saved for a much more distressed market, but because it would signal a level of panic that the Fed would see as a detrement to the markets, particularly heading into the new year.
**MM quote:**
&gt;... the Fed will leave the Fed funds target rate at 0-0.25% next Wednesday, promising to keep it there until the goal of maximum employment and inflation being on track to moderately exceed 2% for some time is met  their dot diagram will continue to suggest this wont happen before 2023.

[MORE HERE](https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/fundamental/forecast/weekly/usd/2020/12/13/US-Dollar-Outlook-Hinges-on-Federal-Reserve-Interest-Rate-Decision.html)

**2) Expansion of Fed asset purchases**
*Current: $120B (80B of treasuries purchases, 40B of Mortgage-backed securities)*
This has been the Fed's most powerful tool in stimulating the markets, particularly the treasuries.  More on this type of activity here [DD link], but the long and short of it is that the more treasuries the Fed purchases, the more market participants are pressured to buy stonks instead of bonds.
**Any likely changes?** Probably not.
Given that the stimulus talks are stalling for like the 70th time while COVID cases are rising and important economic factors like weekly jobs numbers are tanking,  there *has* been reserved optimism that the Fed could decide to expand it's balance sheet on asset purchases.  The overall sentiment, however, is that its unlikely to see an expansion for the same reason we won't see a change to the Federal interest rate: the desire not to create panic at such a sensitive time for the markets.
**MM quote:**
&gt;	They have to get incrementally more dovish next week...Increasing the size of QE might send a little more alarming signal than they would like to take at this moment.

[MORE HERE](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/11/heres-everything-the-federal-reserve-could-do-at-its-policy-meeting-next-week.html)

**So, if these changes are unlikely, what are the options left, then?**  They are subtle, but important; two FOMC factors that may not make a huge splash in the news, but could make a huge splash in the markets.

**1) Tweaking which treasuries they purchase, shuffling around the 80B to longer dated maturities:**
The Fed could decide to fuck around with the steepening yield curve.  By moving their purchases to more longer dated bond maturities (for example, shifting more of the 80B QE fund to purchasing 20/30 year maturity bonds instead of 10) they could end up providing a fairly large boost to stonk buying without actually spending more money overall on the balance sheet.  There is chatter that the Fed wants to do whatever is possible to keep yields on the 20 at 1% or lower, and this move could do it.
**Is this likely to happen?** 50/50
Some market watchers think it will happen because the factors mentioned earlier necessitate it (stimulus deadlock, virus uptick, struggling jobs numbers).  Yes, there is a vaccine coming, but the market has to *survive* in the meantime, and a lot of factors are stacked against it.
**Do I think it will happen?**Probably not.  
I dont think the Fed wants to roil the treasuries market around the holidays, AND would want to stay hands off with stimulus talks ongoing while this meeting is taking placethe Fed wants, and needs, to put pressure on congress for fiscal stimulus and leaving the yield curve untouched will do that.  Any further yield curve tinkering will signal to congress that help is there for their precious stonks wiht or without the stimulus passing.  If stimmy talks fail again, though, I definitely think this could come to fruition at the January meeting.
MM quote:
&gt;A number of economists believe that the Fed should tamp down on any further steepening of the U.S. Treasury yield curve by shifting the focus of its purchases to longer-dated bonds from shorter-dated instruments.

**2) Outcome-based guidance**
This term sounds like bullshit but it is not.  This essentially means the Fed will peg QE measures 2021 to how the economy is performing, on this predetermined scale  The reason its not bullshit is because, without discussing the Federal funds rate, it gives both the public and (probably more importantly) Congress an idea of what kind of footing the economy needs to be on, by when, and how the Fed will respond.
**Is this lilkely to happen?** Yes.  
Most market watchers are expecting some sort of firm guidance to show us where we could go in 2021.
**Do I think it will happen? ** Yes.  
I think, [especially after the Treasury started beef with the Fed by putting an end to critical crises-era programs ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/treasury-seeks-to-extend-some-emergency-fed-programs-but-end-others-including-main-street-facility.html), the Fed is going to pushback by tying the Fed programming to economic indicators which can be largely effected by fiscal stimulus.  There is more the Fed can do, as theye stated many times, but at this point our growing economic woes are self-inflicted, and I expect guidance to reflect that.
MM quote:
&gt;We could see a change in guidance relating to the asset purchases, which currently stand at $80bn of Treasuries and $40bn of Mortgage Backed Securities each month. At present they merely comment that over coming months the purchases will continue at least at the current pace. Officials have hinted they could make the pace of purchases more conditional on economic conditions. 

[MORE HERE](https://think.ing.com/articles/us-what-to-expect-from-the-december-fomc-meeting/)

**Conclusions Im drawing:**
I dont think the Fed is offering shit in terms of solid market help through, really, the only potential way it woulda shift into purchasing a larger amount of longer-dated maturities within the current 80B treasury purchase budget.  It seems like the market, from a lot of articles Ive read, is holding out hope on that (especially in light of worsening conditions), so if it doesnt happen we definitely got a dip coming.

**Im viewing the importance of this meeting in the context of several problematic outside factorsstimulus talks stalling, Brexit and the Europoors on they full Oliver Twist rn, and terrible job numbers likely coming this week.**  I know PFE was given the go-ahead this weekend, but I dont have much confidence in that carrying us much past the likely green Monday with such a turbulent week ahead (my 367c 12/14 im bagholding certainly fucking hope so on the Monday part).

SPY is already unperforming by typical December standards, and certainly by the years insane standard. **So then, by my logic, market momentum truly becomes an issue of two factors: FOMC meeting results, and the stimulus talks going well.  I will be the first to admit that my optimism on the stimulus is seeming increasingly incorrect**, and Im growing doubtful it will be finished next weekthough there will be lots of little meaningless talk going well pums.
*The questions iswillPow and the FED use their big, swinging QE tools to save EOY market optimism during this FOMC meeting? For me, the signs point to no.*

**Positions**
I know I know, I literally just said I hate VIX and have broken up with it, but I took another look, and rethought about its purose.  I do believe by Tuesday, especially assuming we are green-ish or flat Monday, there will be a spike in options premiums in preparation for the FOMC and Stimulus shenanigans.  That said, I will be keepingbut trimming my precious calls positions 

(**AAPL, TDOC, TOL, HPQ, TGT, WMT**) and adding quite a bit of these on Monday EOD
**VXX 12/24 18c**
**VXX 1/8 18.50c**
**VXX 1/15 20c**

These are not permanent positions, this is me riding the wave of the turbulence likely in the next week or two, and forward looking volatility hedges for inauguration.
In case Jerome does decide to cap longer-term maturity yields strapping a hedge of 
**TLT 12/24 158p**

TLDR: Not much help is likely to come from the FOMC meeting this week, but there is potential for a big subtle change in bond purchases.  My thesis is that this meeting will be the opportunity for the Fed to push pressure back to congressional fiscal stimulus, so Powell can provide guidance on when and how it will direct its balance sheet in 2021.  FOMC is a way bigger deal this time around than usual, please pay attention.

**TLDR of TLDR:** Theta gang probably wins, but maybe grab some VXX bro

Title: My Tesla Stock Price Predictions | Buy or Sell Before Entering the SP500? Tesla Stock Price Target [12-13]
**Should you buy Tesla stock before it enters the SP500 or should you wait it out? My price prediction for Tesla. It is a very long post but read until the end of the post as I give my price target for TESLA long-term and also what I think will happen in the next couple of weeks**

Hey everyone and Welcome! This is a very long post just so you know but lets go over some of the latest news on Tesla before moving on to some analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock.

So, Tesla has seen a huge move to the upside after the SP500 inclusion [news](https://ibb.co/j3F9CJM), as the stock started to surge with a 10% spike in just the first day and continue to [gain](https://ibb.co/fDz4J19) around 50% since that news came out, as the company has surpassed a [market cap](https://ibb.co/JRMGspK) of $500B, that means the company is valued more than Toyota, GM, Ford, Nissan and Honda combined.

The EV world has seen a huge spike in the last couple of years and will continue to benefit a lot from the move to green energy. The EV short-term share of [sales](https://ibb.co/QpXc1Kj) is expected to rise in China to 15% by 2023 with the rest of the world lagging behind, but in the long-term, by 2040, most of the worlds regions are expected to have over 30% market share for EVs with China, Europe and the US leading the way as the Global market share should reach around 60% by 2040.

Also, Tesla seems to be on track to make new investments in [Indonesia](https://ibb.co/SndLK1N) as they hunt for Nickel, the most important component in batteries. The [price](https://ibb.co/wKfBckY) of this commodity has gone up almost 20% this year, hurting the possibility of Tesla to either make bigger profits or make cheaper cars that will attract even more buyers.

Meanwhile, it was just [announced](https://ibb.co/ZYfNpP6) that Tesla will replace Apartment Investment and Management with the ticker AIV in the SP500 which saw the its [stock](https://ibb.co/wK9YqrK) value plummet after the news. They will also replace Occidental Petroleum with the ticker [OXY](https://ibb.co/yFF01HH) in the SP100.

Other good [news](https://ibb.co/pxZypr4) came for Tesla from China, as they reported an increase of more than 100% year over year in EVs and hybrid car sales. With sales of electric cars from Tesla surpassing 21.000 in the last month. While overall car [sales](https://ibb.co/FXyXnhG) also increased in China more than 11% since last year to over 2.3M.

Also, the company has declared that they will [continue](https://ibb.co/s9Wp63Q) to sell around $5B in shares at market price from time to time. This usually is bad news for companies as the value of individual stocks gets diluted. Tesla is seeking to strengthen the balance sheet as they will have more than $20B in cash reserves after the latest stock offering in the next year, as the total cash reserves have been [increasing](https://ibb.co/C9GVYR6) steadily, as well as using part of the funds for general corporate purposes by getting out of the debt of the company while also continuing to innovate, as the company is [forecasted](https://ibb.co/ZdYPdX3) to spend around $50B in capex and R&amp;D in the next 5 years, more than double what GM is targeting to spend in the same period.

My opinion is that Musk is brilliant, he is selling stock at very good prices as young retail investors just keep buying this stock at any price. And with $5B in [SHARES](https://ibb.co/CVK554V) being under 1% of the market cap right now, this will help the company in the long run as more available money brings more stability and probably more research and developments.

So, before even starting, you should now that I am neither a convinced bear or bull that will not change his mind on Tesla. If you do believe this next valuation for the company, then you can agree that Tesla will not only be a car maker in the future, as they keep expanding into more &amp; more businesses like network services, energy storage, the internet-of-cars and even insurance.

The company is also undergoing major growth projects with 3 new [factories](https://ibb.co/mbMZKKX) fin different stages of construction in Shanghai, Berlin and Austin, this will help them to have the ability to respond to the huge demand in the EV market alongside the already established Freemont and Buffalo factories.

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research.

This are my 2023 [projections](https://ibb.co/cyr3Sr8) for Tesla, I expect them to have around $112B in automotive sales revenue by that year, as I expect they will be able to sell around 2.8M cars worldwide at around a $40K price, which is way below the average $54K they sell cars at the moment. So, as the cheaper models become available, I expect this to decrease to around $40K, that seems pretty reasonable to me. I will give them around a 3% of the automotive sales in lease revenue, as they have stood around this rate in the past, as not many people lease Teslas.

I will also give them the benefit of the doubt of almost doubling the Energy revenues, as they stand at around $580M in the last quarter, so that would be around $2.4B on an annual basis. And will also give them around 10% of the automotive sales in services and other revenues as this has been a pretty steady number in the past for the company.

You can see in the latest [earnings](https://ibb.co/FKyY0mm) report that the company has been improving almost in every department in the last quarters with the exception of Q1 this year as they were forced to shut down part of the operations at the end of Q1 and the start of Q2.

This is what my projections are based on in both revenues and expenses. 

So, about the [expenses](https://ibb.co/WPYsV2g) expenses in 2023, I will lower the expense margin from around 72% where it stands at the moment to around 70% where Musks target is in the future as this has been improving in the last years for automotive sales. I will also keep the same expense margin on leases and services. While on Energy expenses I will be more conservative and give them a 90% expense margin, even if this might improve to 80-85% if they do want to raise the price for the products and sacrifice some growth.

This means that they will have a gross [income](https://ibb.co/qsbTKCw) of around $37.5B in 2023.

And meanwhile the company is also expected to have some big investments going in 2023 as well, as I made a [projection](https://ibb.co/mXqjr5n) based on past expenses that rounded up to around $9B. They will also have some interest [expenses](https://ibb.co/DzqP6jp) due as the company does still have significant debt but they are working on lowering that as I previously mentioned with new money being raised from time to time by selling stocks.

I will also keep them in the same tax bracket as in the past at a 28% level which gives the company an [income](https://ibb.co/yd6gC03) after tax of almost $20B.

So, guys, at the moment there are over 1.1B shares outstanding of Tesla.

And with my current [projections](https://ibb.co/q1qTDMs) the company would make almost $18 per share in earnings in 2023.

That would mean the stock is trading at 34 times future earnings right now, which compared to the insane current price to earnings [ratio](https://ibb.co/DCPSp0W) which stands at over 1200, that would be amazing. If the stock would trade at 40x forward earnings, which is very low compared to lowest P/E in the last 10 years, that would mean the stock would trade at over 700$ and if you slightly increase that to a 50x future PE the stock would jump to almost 900$

Tesla has been mostly improving its free cash flow to around $1.4B in the last [quarter](https://ibb.co/Q6rq81y), which was only hit at the begging of this year, while also increasing the total amount of operating cash flow.

Here are some of the [highlights](https://ibb.co/bJ6nCMK) that were reported in the latest earnings report.

As the company increased the balance sheet by almost $6B. While the company would have posted an even bigger earnings per share if the stock-based compensations would have been removed, as they accounted for over $540M.

The company reported record vehicle deliveries, profitability and free cash flow while continuing to develop the 3 big factories.

Since the earnings reports they have also started to rollout the Full-Self-Driving feature in more and more cars and kept that promise.

The company has [posted](https://ibb.co/48f0RkN) a beat of earnings expectations in the last quarter, and is expected to see an increase in both revenue and earnings, with the growth expected to continue in the future based on what [analysts](https://ibb.co/SsvpySz) expect to see, as they expect over 50% increases year over year for each of the next 4 quarters.

So, I will give you 3 targets for my bear, normal and bull cases for this company. I [expect](https://ibb.co/0JZt94D) the lowest the stock can reach by 2023 is around 700$ which would give you a rate of return of almost 15% by 2023. While my base case price target for Tesla is around 850$ which would bring you almost 40% returns on the capital invested by 2023. And my bull case for the stock would see the stock valued at over $1K, that would mean an impressive 72% return on investment by 2023.

So here is the full [spreadsheet](https://ibb.co/qYGyxCF) that I have projected for Tesla in 2023, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, with only a couple of big assumptions that they will increase the Energy revenues and the Automotive profit margins slightly.

Keep in mind, this might sound ridiculous, but just look at the growth Tesla has had in the last 10years. The company has [increased](https://ibb.co/t4NsKbD) in value by more 760% in just the past year and is almost 10.000% up in the last 10 years. So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company, but are you willing to bet against Elon Musk? Short sellers have been [crushed](https://ibb.co/XYTkdXf) as they continued to bet against him.

Investors, and mostly the young investors in Tesla dont think at the old &amp; traditional metrics and valuations, they believe that Musk is the new Steve Jobs so they cant get enough of this stock at the moment. 

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Tesla?

Lets look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/mBhVLcW). Starting with the stock split, the stock had a pretty big run which ended with a buy the news &amp; sell the event correction in the stock. After that Tesla continued to trade sideways for over 2 months before spiking once again after the news that the company will be included in the SP500. 

The company had an impressive run from 408$ to almost 650$ in just 3 weeks, and since that moment the stock has seen some resistance at those high levels especially in the 600-630$ range. 

I think we might see a small correction in the stock, to the 550$ levels as this coincides with the 21 EMA, the 21 SMA and the next level of support.

Also, after the SP500 news, the stock was bought on massive volume and was in overbought territory with an RSI over 70, as things have just cooled off a little in the last days with the RSI dropping below overbought territory.

Meanwhile, while expectations have been increasing from retail investors, as they are expecting the stock to always go higher, the latest [news](https://ibb.co/gwj8XKB) that they will have an extended production shutdown after Christmas and maybe also some panic selling if the stock doesnt go up on the 18th or 21st, as most retail investors probably expect the stock to go even higher after the SP500 inclusion, may bring Tesla into correction territory.

The spike in stocks after inclusion in index funds has been proven wrong time and time again. Just look at this [chart](https://ibb.co/Hd9n0yy), which shows that companies between 2008 and 2017 saw a negative 2% average return in the next 20 days after the inclusion despite seeing a huge run before the actual day. 

So, what would I do? Well, I owned Tesla stock until about a week ago and sold out at $590 with more than 40% in gains, as I think there will be a slight correction in the stock, and I will get back in the stock after that correction does occur. Remember, I think this stock is going higher in the long-run as my 2023 predictions show, but I did want to take some risk off the table at the moment, as it will be a highly volatile moment for the company. I think there might be a lot of people willing to sell shares on the 18th and 21st, and this might flood the market and drive the price lower, as I think most investors and money managers have already adjusted their portfolios before this [date](https://ibb.co/6W9Y9wD), while a lot of retail investors will be left with stocks that they want to get rid off and fewer and fewer people to buy it.

Title: PLTR - True and Simple DD
Open your calculator and prepare to multiple and divide like the towering intellects you are.  I have boring math that will give you a surge in your portfolio.  

If PLTR makes $0.09 a quarter (like last quarter) for the next three quarters, its EPS will be $0.36 - a forward PE of 77.  

But wait, they are growing like weeds and publicly signing millions.  So lets go out wild and say they earn $0.01 per share more per quarter going forward.  So its $0.09, $0.10, $0.11 and $0.12 - EPS of $0.42.  Suddenly it has a forward PE of 66.

Compared to the other growth names, forward PE doesn't sound bad at all as they continue to grow.  I see them at 55 at end of 2021 and 85 at end of 2022.  At end of 2023, beats 100.

Title: TSMC holds the Crown
Gather round you hopeless autists. We have to talk. Listen to me you hopeless stupid fucking retards.  
The only reason I am not posting this on r/investing is because you asstards need help. There is some  
serious chicken fucking tendies to be made here.  
I'm the guy who famously claimed that Bob Swan, Intel CEO, should fabricate a silicone butt and fuck it  
during Intel's next earning call to appease stock holders instead of going over their financials. (See: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j6ioot/intel\_is\_fucked/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j6ioot/intel_is_fucked/)) As it turns out, I was right and Bob Swan showed everyone how much of a dipshit he really is and how he literally knows nothing about this industry. I doubled my principal on my last Intel put and I plan to do the same with my next more here.  
First, let us a take a good look at what happened to intel. There is so much wrong with that company and I talked about it a lot in my last post. This analyst, Stacy Rasgon, who actually seems to have a basic understanding of this shit, sums it up fairly well. Click the fucking link asshole. Listen to him.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzTg6vWgDhQ  
So what do we have here:  
  "If you start digging in, theres almost no good news here. Gross margins have collapsed."  
  "This is the beginning of the bear thesis which seems to be embedded in the numbers here."  
  "Current trajectory of the business does not look good."  
Jesus Christ. Should have gone with the silicone butt bobby. Intel is ACTUALLY on fire. So what the fuck does intel plan to do about it? Bob Swan said himself on the earnings call that he wants to go with TSMC. Interesting choice Bobby Boy. Interesting because for once this is not a bad decision. But WHY would Bob Swan want to go with TSMC?  
TSMC is perhaps the most strategically important company in the world right now. The American government has dramatically increased military operations with Taiwan.   
One very critical point that the average wsb idiot misses is that TSMC is only a foundry. Because of this they can focus only on improving their chip-manufacturing and not have to worry at all about selling/marketing the chips. Some of the major customers of TSMC are \[3\]:  


* AMD
* Apple (25% of TSMC revenue)
* Broadcom
* Marvell
* MediaTek
* Nvidia
* Qualcomm
* Xilinx

Soon intel as well. Simply put, if any one of those companies above do well then TSMC wins. Their financials are perfect, they are the world leaders in their covid-proof industry, the only fab with a 5nm process and have a ton of massive customers for whom they have great relationships with (they built and bankrolled a new fabrication center just for Apple for fucks sake). If you pay close attention to this stuff, you may have heard how Nvidia recently went to Samsung for fabrication, yeah, Nvidia backtracked quickly on that and they are going back to TSMC due to Samsungs shit yields \[4\].

  
**Stop massaging your wife's boyfriend's vas deferens and listen up.** The American government  
is currently preparing for a war with china over TSMC. The US is rapidly heading from a cold to a hot war with China. Some experts, such as Niall Furgeson, a well respected Stanford historian is already calling it "Cold War 2" \[7\].  
There is a video you must watch on this topic. It is produced by a Chinese-Hating-Korean-Trump-Supporter but it is most primary sources from China and it sums up quite well the China internal sentiment on this issue. (Click it you fucking autist):  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2uP\_8YoJTU&amp;ab\_channel=KoreanaJones  
Well, shit. So here we are:

* The US can no longer fabricate semiconductors, only Taiwan can.
* America will do everything is can as a matter of national security to protect TSMC.
* USA bans China's only serious semi conductor fabricator SMIC. \[5\]
* USA bans anyone from doing business with Chinese tech firms like Huawei. TSMC even confirmed AGAIN they will not fabricate for Huawei. \[6\]
* Taiwan HATES China so they don't actually even want to work with their shitty fake tech companies.
* Semiconductors are critical to a modern economy/military. (Xi JinPing has said this himself.)
* Taiwan's military is a joke compared to China's so they will do everything to appease the Americans  
  for the survival of their nation.
* Hong Kong proved to the world, especially Taiwan, that China has zero interest in honoring any governance agreements made. This raises the stakes for Taiwan dramatically as a cooperation with China means a complete erasure of their culture and history.
* ASML, the people who make the machines for TSMC, are a German company. Unsurprisingly, Germany has taken a similar stance, including military aid, for Taiwan. ASML is a "crown jewel" for Germany and they make a shit ton supporting TSMC.

  
So what is the bear case for a company that is at the heart of US/Taiwan/Germany/Europe national security interests? A company which is ACTUALLY technologically superior to their competition and is basically the only game in town?  
The bear case is potential war with China. But if that happens your positions are going to shit anyway.

Title: It's Time to Pull the Plug on ChargePoint (SBE). The SBE SPAC Deal Is A Shit Deal.
Hey Autists, 

I've made a solid 15k from SBE calls back in November (bought in at 20 and sold at 28), but like most SPAC investors involved with this stock, I had no idea what I was buying into. This SPAC deal, like many of them, is designed to let the insiders unload their shares on the retail investors. The fact that its trading on a 5x multiple before the reverse merger has even occurred is absurd. The good news for you is that you can profit off of wall street's greed, as this is getting closer to tanking every single day. 

First off, a large majority of investors have yet to realize that SBE only represents a 10.3% equity stake in ChargePoint, Inc. It's important to look at page 33 of the investor deck: [https://chargepoint.ent.box.com/s/gm82ewxmfoffwa2kgd7m5773k4u8o9k2#33](https://chargepoint.ent.box.com/s/gm82ewxmfoffwa2kgd7m5773k4u8o9k2#33)

The fair share value of those SBE shares is easy to calculate, they're collectively worth 247.7 million (2.40 billion enterprise value / 10.3) divided by 31.9 million, which leaves you with **$7.76 / share**. That's the actual value each SBE after the merger, and it's trading at $38.00 a share right now. You have to understand that 31.9 million shares is nothing, because there's another 269 million shares held by insiders that will get unloaded when the lock-up period ends (6 months after the reverse merger). If the insiders sold 15% of their stake (which is likely to be even more), that's a greater number of shares being sold at once than SBE's entire current stake in ChargePoint. 

This isn't entirely speculative, look at the price of [SBE.WS](https://SBE.WS) (the warrants). They've completely lagged behind SBE's price growth, at $11.00/warrant. The exercise price is $11.50/share two weeks after the reverse merger, so investors are valuing SBE at less than $22.50 post merger. I firmly believe this will be trading at less than $15/share post merger. 

SBE doesn't even have great prospects for next week. The reverse merger was supposed to happen on 12/15/2020, and that was silently pushed back on 12/04/2020 with an S-4 amendment to a blanket date in 2021. There has been no notification to investors that there was a pushback in the reverse merger date, so I loaded up on puts on Friday as this is bearish news for the stock. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now the grand finale. Guess what, I drive a Model 3, and I use ChargePoint once a week (check my post history). ChargePoint bulls are pointing at President Elect Biden's charging infrastructure plan, you know, those 500,000 highway charging stations. It's a great idea, but it doesn't benefit ChargePoint all that much. ChargePoint is the leader in level 2 charging (6 kWh, slow charging), not level 3, EVGo, ElectrifyAmerica, and several others are dominating the level 3 charging space, and they're far more likely to win those highway charging station contracts. 

ChargePoint has even pointed on on page 166 of their original S-4 that their revenue is declining and will continue to decline until 2022, which is found no where on their investor deck. "For the remainder of fiscal year 2021, ChargePoint expects revenue to continue declining year-over-year given the challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic." ([https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-032076/fs42020\_switchbackenergy.htm](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-032076/fs42020_switchbackenergy.htm#166))

ChargePoint is projecting a $30 million dollar profit (for the first time) in 2024, and because SBE only has a 10.3% stake in ChargePoint, that means a hefty $3 million dollar reward for SBE shareholders (among 31.9 million shares), a mere $0.09 EPS in three years from now. This is a shitty short term prospect, and long term prospect. 

What people don't realize about the EV charging space is that the margins are incredibly slim. I spend $8/week to use a ChargePoint, and a large majority of that goes to the owner of the ChargePoint for electricity use, so ChargePoint only makes $4/month or less from me and I'm a frequent user. Most people charge their EVs from home, and many of them come with a level 2 charger with the vehicle (Teslas do at least). If you're holding this stock long term, good luck to you.

Title: This is the next EV play
Listen here retards. Weve sucked the big EV cow dry. Nio, solo, nkla (bagholders show urselves), etc.
They are all red. Now lets take a step back and analyze our next play. 


What do all these have in common? Batteries. Now how are batteries made? Well I dont fucking know. 


BUT I know that you need rare-earth metals to create them for example: Neodymium.


Now let me tell you that China controls 80% of that supply. And as you know, things are very heated between the west and China. This means that potentially the supply can be cut off or China will increase the prices.


Even elon musk our daddy cant fight this. So we have to help him like the retards we are. 


Thats why this company called MP Materials will save us. They have currently a market cap of 4B. Now imagine when sleepy Joe tries to strengthen USA in the clean energy and EV industry. This thing will fly. Maybe 3-5x their current market cap in the next 4 years. Why would you miss out on that?

Title: Long DISNEY for the next 2 weeks! GREAT RISK TO TENDIES RATIO
 If you haven't been paying attention, $DIS made a monster run on Friday after their 2020 investors day presentation. Yes, some people will say don't chase, don't fomo. But we all see how hard stocks can run off of major catalysts this year. aka TESLA BUY HIGH AND SELL HIGHER.

Why Disney ran so hard? Well they are the king of UNDER PROMISE AND OVER DELIVER. When D+ launched, they expected to get 60-90M subs by 2024 BU THEY ARE HERE AFTER 1 YEAR. They tripled their guidance to now 230-260M by 2024. THAT IS HUGE.

Why will Disney keep running?

1. lets look at what happened after investor's day in 2019...UPWARDS FOR 2 WEEKS!
2. $DIS is gonna get a load of upgrades from banks and investment firms this week. Believe it or not these upgrades and downgrades MOVE STOCKS
3. $DIS will continue to benefit from the rotation out of stay at home stocks to covid recovery plays

TLDR - BUY ALL DIPS ON $DIS as long as the indices hold.

Title: Amazing Buying Opportunity 
Hey retards, Ill keep this basic DD short because I know you dont event read half of the DDs in here.

Amazing buying opportunity this Monday!

Hello guys, if you Look at Virgin Galactic ($SPCE) they had a flight test yesterday that was aborted because the computer that monitors the rocket motor lost connection. As designed, this triggered a fail-safe scenario that intentionally halted ignition of the rocket motor. After this they landed safely in Spaceport America. According to their Twitter statement they are fixing and analysing what went wrong and they are preparing for the second test flight which will be soon.

After these news I believe the stock will drop around 25% because paper hands must have gotten scared or lost faith in this company, therefore, this is the best time to buy shares and keep these for the long term.

Remember that Virgin Galactic is one of the few companies that could have a massive growth potential in the future. They will be the first company to enter and dominate the Space Tourism market with few competition. 

If the next test flight goes well and they reach space the share price is going to Mars, they have contracts with nasa and they are working in other experiments like the jet that would take you from London to New York in two hours. 

For those who dont know Virgin Galactic is a company that wants to bring its customers to space and make it possible for regular people be able to see our home planet from a new perspective. The price of each ticket costs over $250,000 and over 600 people have already booked their place including famous celebrities like Leonardo Dicaprio and Justin Bieber.

As Warren Buffet says: Buy the f*cking dip

Long term calls are the way to go. Remember to do your own DD before options or shares.

Title: Quantum Scape is about to take a Quantum Dump (QS)
Alright you *shrimp-dick fuck nuggets*, listen up because were making fucking tendies. QS or QuantumScape has been seeing crazy momentum in the market recently. They are trading at around 63, but I think this is going to absolutely DUMP on December 21st and possibly longer.

So lets look at Quantum Scape, they are a battery company that merged with KCAC (Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp), and what is even more interesting, is that Volkswagen has been invested and partnered with this company since 2012.  

According to this source

[https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/vw-backed-quantumscape/](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/vw-backed-quantumscape/)

Volkswagen entered the picture in 2012. The automaker has invested a total of $300 million in QuantumScape, including $200 million this year. *Pay attention to the 200 million this year, it may be very big, but we will come back to that at the very end.* 

The same article states the following, QuantumScape said it was able to raise more than $700 million through the business combination, a figure that includes $500 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE. The raise was anchored by institutional investors including **Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company** and **Janus Transaction**

So we see 500 million of 700 million dollars are from PIPE shares. Heres the part where our dick go a slack 2.5in, to firm 3in

**Pipe shares can be sold after a certain amount of time**, and we all know what happens when massive sell offs happen.  

According to the Registration Statement published by the SEC about Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp, Pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, Kensington **agreed** that, **within 15 business days** after the Closing (the Filing Deadline), Kensington will **file** **with** the SEC (at Kensingtons sole cost and expense) a registration statement **registering the resale** of the PIPE Shares.

Source:

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811414/000119312520290474/d14810ds4a.htm

Lets break down what this means exactly because the language can be confusing (at least it was to me at first because Im retarded, why else am I here?).

There is a 15 day countdown starting AFTER their closing day, this was Nov 27th when they officially merged, which was a Friday. Because this 15 day countdown only includes business days, that means the countdown actually starts the following Monday, Nov 30th, since that is the next business day that follows the closing day. Now, during this countdown Kensington will file WITH the SEC a registration statement registering the resale of PIPE shares. So this registration statement will register the shares to be sold. Now, the word register for the resale of the shares may sound ambiguous. Does it mean they now have the potential to be sold, but maybe on a different day? Does this registration mean they CAN IN FACT be sold once theyre registered? Well this next piece of info will be useful to understand, hopefully making your smooth marble brains get some fucking wrinkles.  

Since this offering was a PIPE, the buyers cannot sell their shares until the company files its resale registration statement with the SEC.**However, an issuer generally cannot sell more than 20% of its outstanding stock at a discount without receiving prior approval from current shareholders**. *(We will get to the importance of the bolded area at the end)*

Source: 

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pipe.asp#:\~:text=Since%20this%20offering%20was%20a,prior%20approval%20from%20current%20shareholders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pipe.asp#:~:text=Since%20this%20offering%20was%20a,prior%20approval%20from%20current%20shareholders).

Once the SEC declares the registration statement effective, the PIPE investors are then generally able to freely resell their shares in the trading market.

[https://www.paulhastings.com/docs/default-source/PDFs/715.pdf](https://www.paulhastings.com/docs/default-source/PDFs/715.pdf)

You might ask Is there a lock up for these PIPE shares? And the answer to that is that it is contingent on whether or not the resale registration statement is *effective* or not. So far as I can tell (once again, am retarded), at the end of the 15 day countdown, its merely a countdown to have a resale registration agreement written up in general, not necessarily an effective one.  

However, from the same SEC document it states Kensington is separately required at all times to maintain an **effective** resale registration statement for the benefit of the Holders.

So, now we know they have to make this registration AND they have to do it in a 15 business day period. With some math we can figure out exactly what day PIPE shares can be sold off. Im not going to talk down to you autists, even though youre retarded, but 15 business days after November 30th is December 18th. But December 18th is the fifteenth day of the countdown, so it cant be sold then. Keep in mind that December 18th is a Friday also, so we can expect a BLOODY RED MONDAY for QS if they are going to sell their PIPE shares. Now thats a big IF.

Lets take a look at just how much PIPE shares make up of the total shares.  

From the same SEC document

PIPE means the sale of PIPE Shares to the Subscribers, for a purchase price of **$10.00 per share** and an **aggregate purchase price of $500million**, in a private placement.

So what we are looking at is 50 million shares potentially sold off on Monday the 18th. How much is this in reality?

Well according to [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/qs/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/qs/institutional-holdings)

Their outstanding shares right now are 189 million. This means that these pipe shares make up 26.5% of ALL of QSs shares. If we were to see a sell off of this amount, the value of QS would plunder to such an inconceivable amount we could walk away with major tendies.

Now the question is.are they going to sell their shares? Well if we take a look at WHO bought these PIPE shares, we can most likely answer that. Fidelity and Janus are both investment companies who are involved in mutual funds and have clients that they make money for. Because these pipe shares were valued at 10 dollar each, while also looking at QSs current price. They are currently up 600%+ with 50 million shareswould you take that profit?

Not only that, but the discussion of the SPAC bubble has been trending for a few weeks now. As we know, SPACs have been huge this year, and the SPAC bubble is the fear of overvaluing companys that IPO in mass quantities which results in a huge crash later on.  

Do you think Fidelity hasnt heard of this? Why would Fidelity and Janus take a risk of getting more money when they are up 600%+ AND they have clients to look after? The fact of the matter is, is they wont take this risk, the amount of money gained and any potential of a SPAC bubble popping would have any investor taking profits ASAP.

Now, there were two things I mentioned in the post that I would discuss now. That is Volkswagens involvement in QS and this quote 

However, an issuer generally cannot sell more than 20% of its outstanding stock at a discount without receiving prior approval from current shareholders.

In regards to Volkswagen, they have been involved with QS since 2012, they could potentially have shares that they want to sell. They also gave 200 million dollars this year, could this be the purchasing of PIPE shares? Who knows.I sure as fuck dont, but the potential of more shares being sold from another company involved in QS is something that is good for this. If not, it doesnt matter all that much given the other information, since it still stands true with or without Volkswagens involvement.

Now, in regards to the quote mentioned before, it could be the case that on December 21st, only 20% of the 50 million shares that Fidelity and Janus hold will be sold. Even so, 20% of 50 million is still 10 million shares or around 5.3% of the outstanding shares that QS has.  

In conclusion, I think we are looking at a great opportunity to make tendies boys.  

TLDR; Eat grass, smoke ass, short QS, make tendies

Positions to get in on: Dec 24 50p 

You could go further expiration, or you could go further OTM. Who am I kidding though, you idiots are gonna grab FDs. Just make sure its not December 18th.

Title: TSLA to the moon! Part 2 (the DD)
I'm making this post because I'm tired of the misinformation and lack of understanding. So? Time to break out the big boy thesis: Tesla is going to the moon,or atleast minimum $700.

Please see my first post about what I'm doing--&gt; [TSLA to the moon! Part 1(the non DD)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kbyju1/tsla_to_the_moon_part_1_the_non_dd/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) (if you curious)

**Fact: Tracking &amp; benchmarked Funds have to purchase over 100million of tesla shares.**

\-to help illustrate this point see rob's video [Tesla Daily](https://youtu.be/QgCt2LRUj0k?t=248) it illustrates the need for shares, how many, and why exactly the price isnt going to change the number much. To make it easier for you laggards out there. it doesn't matter if TSLA's price hits $1000 they still need over 100million shares. That's ALOT of buying pressure. Here's another blog that allows you to download the excel spread sheets and play with the numbers. I advise you to do so to gain deeper understanding of not only why the statements i am presenting are closer to grounded facts than conjecture. read through it thoroughly if you would like: [Tesla Blog](https://teslainvestor.blogspot.com/2020/11/teslas-s-500-inclusion-part-2.html?m=1). I'm going to take a few excerpts from it.

**Fact: They must purchase these shares the day before the day of inclusion** (in this case the 18th).  They also can NOT have done this months prior for it would throw off the precise tracking of the s&amp;p 500 etfs and those following it. And they cannot have done it after for the same reason.

Sources: Tesla daily on YouTube:

 \[tesla daily #2\]([https://youtu.be/ d\_t4Cmuib6w](https://youtu.be/d_t4Cmuib6w))

"The stock will be added at its full float-adjusted market capitalization **before the open of trading on Dec. 21**, the index provider said." That's a vote for the **18th.**

\[2nd (pay or subscribe wall but scroll and see. i can see it on my laptop not my phone)\]([https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-to-enter-s-p-500-at-full-weight-in-december-11606780897](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-to-enter-s-p-500-at-full-weight-in-december-11606780897))

"The index company said Tesla will be added to the broad stock-market gauge before the start of trading Dec. 21, meaning most index-tracking funds that follow the S&amp;P 500 will engage in a flurry of trading the Friday before." Another vote for the **18th.**

Linked Study(pdf). If it doesn't open, go to google type in 'can a stock be added "before the inclusion date" '. 2nd link. Page 10. [Study(page 10)](https://thesis.eur.nl/pub/33763/MA-Thesis-Robert-Kaptein.pdf)

"Index funds try to follow the return of a specific index **as accurate as possible**, therefore they will need to buy the included stock before the actual inclusion takes place. To find the exact moment on which index funds buy the included stocks and sell the excluded stock, Think ETFs, a Dutch ETF provider was interviewed about their trading procedure in case of an annual review (2016). Martijn Rozemuller, founder and managing director, and Aaron Renkers, fund manager, confirmed that Think ETFs ideally buys the included stocks at the **market close of the day before the actual review takes place.** Index fund providers need to make sure that that they have the **included stocks before the inclusion day in order to prevent the risk of not completely following the index. Therefore index funds buy in the period before the inclusion date and at the latest at the market close of the last day before the index inclusion.** Therefore one would expect an upward price pattern in the days before the inclusion, and vice versa for exclusions.  " 

I previously thought it could be done 3 days before and after the inclusion date, but i cannot find any evidence indicating this, so i will leave it out. but this makes it pretty clear that the 18th is the big day where over 100 million shares need to be bought. so don't be fooled by naysayers or those who seek to gain something by telling you its another day or its already have been bought. now you can clearly see they are fools, who are ignorant of the truth. Now I will not count out illegal activity because lets be honest, this is wallstreet fellow degenerates. But all funds buying before in liquid accounts this big to alleve buying pressure? likelihood is low,(and that it doesn't get caught) but there will always be those anomalies. 

**Fact: The 5 billion Offering was less than 1% of the company's current value.** This lowered the selling pressure a bit But not much.

" With Teslas market capitalization at $598 billion, the new offering represents less than 1% of the companys value. " [CNBC Article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/08/tesla-to-raise-up-to-5-billion-in-share-offering.html)

So I think I've made the landscape pretty clear for this upcoming week. If I've missed anything please let me know so I can update this. Thanks for reading!

TLDR: Tesla is mooning, hop on board. And don't believe the b.s. people are pushing without sources to back it up.

Title: Cannabis stocks upcoming news dates
12/14 - georgia senate runoffs begins

12/16 - new jersey votes in cannabis bill

1/1 - new jersey laws take effect

1/5 - runoff election ends + electoral vote for biden

1/20 - biden inauguration

Georgia senate runoffs are important because if the democrats win, then they would swing the vote left for the senate with VP as swing vote for federal decriminalization + medical cannabis research with dispensary level cannabis. 

New jersey laws are important because itll put tons of pressure on new york, and therefore other states, to introduce cannabis legislation. Cuomo promised to legalize it in 2020 but failed to deliver because of covid, but with NJ passing the law im sure he will pressured to make a statement. Huge catalyst for the northeasts cannabis legislature. 

Dont have to explain why good news about biden will make the market jump. Him/Kamala will definitely make statements about legalization that will make the whole market jump. 

I think the next month well see a huge bull run for various cannabis companies.

It's simple.. Chegg is booming lately from people using their educational resources while taking classes from home. 10B market cap, 20EV/sales, 50%+ growth rate.. huge growth potential? not for long.

So Chegg is basically helping people cheat in school...great right? but in there T&amp;C there's a catch. They have rights to give YOUR INFORMATION TO YOUR SCHOOL upon request. There's been tons of students this year who have been kicked out of their programs just for having a Chegg account or having access to certain documents with test answers.

Chegg users- anyone know anything about this? also use a vpn and fake name and you'll be fine lol

If you wonder why the years 1920-1929 are romanticized in our cultural history as one big playful, perpetual party, its because people felt they were overdue for enjoying life to the fullest, having just been dealt a bad hand of too much death and disease. Much like where we found ourselves now.

Title: AFRM to da MOON - the IPO you don't want to sleep on 
At this point, im pretty much giving up on trying to dip into IPOs so imma just throw out the research that I have done on it and why this one is just going to straight up open up at 200%+. If you can dip in at ipo pricing, this one is definitely going to be free tendies and you will hate yourself for sleeping on it. For those who cant participate in the ipo, you might want to look at Big Fu\*king Tendies which is going to merge with Paysafe and ill be posting a DD on that very soon so stay tuned. 

Buckle up my fellow retards cause today were going to be talking about Affirm IPO and how its about to bring us tendies through our weaponized autism. The company focuses on buy now pay later market along with other financial services. Affirm **demonstrates serious potential with solid 98% yoy growth with narrowing losses** and **a disruptive business model that creates a mutual win-win situation between the merchants and the customers** by undercutting the traditional financing cost and bringing more sales to merchants. With the **recent acquisition of PayBright, a Canadian buy now pay later provider, Affirm is looking to expand aggressively and to increase market domination in the sector by increasing the targeted region, larger and more diverse merchant network and reach to more users**. Affirm is set to gain 7000 merchants and thereby increasing the reach to more potential long-term customers. Affirm is also looking for more expansion via **deep integration partnership with shopify to power shop pay installments. (shopify actually owns 5% of affirm)**

What is Affirm?

Affirm is a latest fintech company that mainly focuses on the buy now pay later market while providing various other services such as saving account and virtual card. The goal of the Affirm is to be as ubiquitous, secure and convenient as legacy networks, yet far more transparent, honest and both consumer and merchant centric. Affirm currently **has more than 6.2M+ consumers, 6500+ merchants, a 64% consumer retention rate, 100% merchant retention rate and a Gross Merchandise value of 10.7Bil since 2017 with a whopping 77% growth from 2.6bil to 4.6bil from 2019 to 2020.** With the traditional credit and debit cards are designed to butt plug and milk the crap out of consumers as consumers paid approximately $121 billion in credit card interest, $11 billion on overdraft fees and $3billion in late fees and does very little to assist merchants to overcome the two biggest challenges; the cost of acquire a customer and the cost to convert a sale. **With Affirm, consumers benefit from having access to 0% APR financing or a financing plan that is more affordable and more transparent than the credit card rate and little to no penalties to late payments. The merchants benefit from having more customers and better conversion due to the lower rate. Under partnerships with Affirm, dollar-based merchants retention has consistently exceeded 100% for each cohort of merchants that joined and merchants also reported 92% and 85% higher average order value in 2018 and 2019.** 

**Service Provided**

**1)** **Buy now pay later (with special financing options from partnered merchants)**

**2)** **Virtual card (works just like credit and debit account which grants you the buy now pay later option to any non-participated merchants)**

**3)** **High interest saving account** 

**The revenue source of Affirm is built upon**

**1)**  **Merchant fees with larger merchant fees on 0% APR financing products (0% APR financing represents 43% and 46%)**

**2)** **Interest income on simple interest loans from originating bank partners of consumer purchases** 

**3)** **Portion of the interchange fee from the transaction through virtual card which provides flexibility and essentially cheap credits to users by allowing customers to shop with merchants that may not yet be fully integrated with Affirm** 

Future Projection:

With the dying retail stores and rapid adaption of e-commerce from Gen Z and Millennials, global online sales grew 20% to approximately $3.4 trillion in 2019 and is expected to grow to approximately $5.8 trillion by 2023. As more and more people moving purchase online on top of the pandemics we are facing today, e-commerce has become one of the most rapid growth markets in the past few years **with the buy now pay later being the fast fastest growing e-commerce payment method globally. In North America, buy now pay later: market share is expected to triple 3% of the e commerce payments market by 2023 and with other regions already accounts for 6% of the e commerce payment market and is expected to soar to almost 10% by 2023. With the acquisition of paybright which provides affirm access to 7000+ more merchants and the deep integration with shopify, expect affirm to do be a money printing machine down the road.**

**Overall, banking on the poor via cheap and accessible credits in general is an economic concept that has been tested over and over again in various countries to be extremely profitable and beneficial to the overall economic. With cheap and accessible credits, one could also expect higher demand for products with higher price tags. It is no surprise that most partnered luxury brands offer 0% APR financing options and one should expect to see more partnerships with luxury brands coming soon. As a result, expect this shit to do very well in the future.**

&amp;#x200B;

Potential downside?

On the SEC filing, they have listed that the peloton sales currently make up about 28% of the revenue. At the first glance, it may seem like a really bad news, however, such could also be interpreted as a working business model doing what its intended to do as stated above. In the case of Peloton, it shows that with the access to cheap credits, people are more willing to make big purchases and merchants could benefit tremendously from the increase in demand from it. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Shit gonna moon. 100% yoy growth and narrowing net loss. Expanding aggressively with shopify to leverage on. FK BOOMER BANKS.

Title: Amazon.com: Overvalued, undervalued, fairly valued?
Ladies and gentlemen,

it's your boy chimpu with the trading range for the upcoming week, SPY between 200 and 8.000, personal bias moon.

Now that I got your attention I want tp present you a lengthy (yawn) analysis of Amazon (AMZN) stock. For the tl;dr look out for the rockets. Seriously, some lost components of that SPCE rocket might fall onto you so watch out.

I spare you from why Amazon is the obvious winner this year, we all know that. My focus rather is on valuation and also a little bit of TA (I know it's bogus but good enough for confirmation bias).

So from a valuation standpoint of view Amazon has gained 68,65% ytd. This seems like a good bull run outperforming the broader market. However, since the beginning of July, the stock started to trade sideways not gaining any traction to the upside. 

[YTD performance](https://preview.redd.it/7athhpnnds461.png?width=1515&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=037cc4d739a1ce7867c645318e770a7d24b571b3)

However, those 68% do not tell the true story. We have to look back to the 19th February 2020. The stock closed at $2.170. Days and weeks later, the rona crashed the market and Amazon went down with it (to the 1600s). From the pre-rona high till Friday close (Dec 11), Amazon gained *only* 43,7%. 

[pre-rona till today gain](https://preview.redd.it/u7bcxq5afs461.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2dbb287cdaeeb247f42ea7037723630f42d677bd)

That is, in all honesty not the best performance in the market considering the stellar rise of the Snowflakes, Nios, Palantirs, Fastlys &amp; co. And I don't want to compare these stocks with Amazon, because Amazon of course fights against the law of the large numbers and is a 1.6T dollar behemoth that moves slower by nature.

Btw: The yellow line above seems like a good trend line being a support several times in recent weeks, doesn't it?

Now, valuation:

The classical valuation metric is P/E ratio. Amazon currenty trades at a 91 P/E ratio on a trailing twelve months basis. This is slightly above the historical average during the last 2 years or so (I don't want to talk about 2015 when there were no earnings or when it traded at a 1000 multiple). 

 

[TTM P\/E ratio](https://preview.redd.it/6nqmxgjqgs461.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91895116667b2fe9de1319018e66441b080e0ca8)

For a FY2020 prediction we have to look into the guidance that Amazon gave us, which - if we take the middle of it - would lead us to about the same TTM EPS by the end of FY2020 and therefore the same P/E ratio (\~90). Amazon, using these numbers wil report about $17.5 bn in earnings.

That 90 P/E ratio may sound more expensive than it was pre-Covid, but it misses one vital fact: The Covid-related extra expenses + the money Amazon invested into its business in 2020 ([amazon grows physcial space by 50% in 2020](https://www.inddist.com/company-expansion-consolidation/news/21142476/amazon-expects-to-grow-its-physical-space-by-50-this-year)). At least Covid-related costs are temporary only and thus in the mid-term future these extra expenses will be additional pure cash on Amazon's earnings statement. But how high were those extra costs related to the rona? Adding up the sum Amazon itself expected in their Q1, Q2 and Q3 2020 report this reaches $10 bn (4+2+4bn), see [Amazon's Qs reports](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/quarterly-results/default.aspx). So the (conservative, as Amazon always crushes earnigns guidance and eastimates in recent times) $17.5 bn + $10 bn would sum up to $27.5 earnings. Let's assume Amazon doesn't grow earnings in 2021, with a stock price of $3100 that would now lead us to a forward P/E ratio of 56,7. Now that doesn't seem too expensive anymore for a company that will this year grow revenues by about 35% and just having grown their Q3 earnings 96% YoY. 

Assuming above that Amazon's earnings will stall, while Amazon's revenue growth definitely will slow in 2020, this almost definitely won't be the case for earnings in 2021 due to the effects mentioned above. Other effects propelling Amazon's earnings higher will be classical economy of scale arguments, e.g. cost efficiency in the logistics department as Amazon continues to build its own cost saving delivery infrastucture. Another factor for that is that the business segments with the highest margins will be the ones growing their revenue the most, namely AWS, the ad segment and the recurring prime subscription fees. 

Amazon's recent move into the pharmacy business should not be disregarded but isn't even necessary to drive Amazon's numbers higher.

And we should also expect Amazon to blow out earnings. They will beat to the upside both top and bottom line, driving numbers higher and multipes even lower. Use google trends to find out yourself with the [google trends search tool](https://trends.google.de/trends/explore?date=2019-09-01%202020-12-12&amp;geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0mgkg) (it is worth to be mentioned that the google trends search tool doesn't really reflect the growth, as the average basket size per order at Amazon grows as well as this feature of course only tracks people who go to google first and type "amazon" to go to their website instead of visiting it directly or - more important - using the app. It just gives you an idea).

***Approaching Amazon's valuation on a Cash flow based modell***

Above we approached valuation with an earnings-focused modell and saw that in the not too distant future Amazon will be able to slowly lower their earnings ratios approaching the likes of Apple, Alphabet or Miscrosoft (in the central or upper 30s).

However, if we ever based our investment decision about Amazon on a earnings multiple modell, the stock would have never been a buy and we missed out the entirety of this growth story. Therefore, in my opinion it is better to measure Amazon's value on a Cash-flow basis. This not only allows us to understand the actual profitability and margins of the business, but also shows how heavily Amazon invests in its business to expand and grow by all measurable figures.

Of the greatest interest to me is the Operating Cash Flow (OCF). Amazon's FY2017 OCF was $18.5bn and now is at about $52.2bn on a TTM basis. This is an incease of 176% in less than 3 years.

[Amazon's OCF 2017-TTM](https://preview.redd.it/ulu1b59mos461.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f168135fd272e024f23e5a589ecaaf486b1ee838)

For comparison, Microsoft: MSFT's OCF at the end of theor fiscal year in June 2017 was at $39,5bn, now it is at $66,2bn, which is a growth of 67,6% in a time of 3,5 years.

[Microsoft's OCF 06\/2016-TTM](https://preview.redd.it/6rnhdsv6ps461.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06ebf214f9049a8dda0489badc1a0bbb8e5f4058)

Both are amazing growth rates, both are amazing companies, Amazon is a true growth stock and Microsoft sits somewhere between growth and value. 

&amp;#x200B;

If - again looking at the Cash Flow statement of Amazon above - one can see the immense amount of money Amazon is investing in its business. On a TTM basis this amounts to more than -$35bn Investing Cash Flow. And as I mentioned above, we can physically see this growth and these costs looking at the porches of the sUbUrBaN wOmEn'S houses drowning in Amazon parcels. This amount of parcels can only be delivered by expanding the logistics infrastructure, warehouse capacity and workforce. And this expansion is right there above, in the TTM Investing Cash Flow -$35bn. Once Amazon has grown to a fully unfolded, mature company with the groundwork being laid years ago, these investing expenditures will decrease and in combination with further economy of scale synergies their earnings will be propelled higher and higher.

But we are right now nowhere near a truly mature Amazon. With the growth rates Amazon has today, it will be the largest listed company of the US rather sooner than later.

***Now an itzy bitzy of TA***

Look at the first chart I posted at the very beginning of the analysis. You see a tightening triangle. Amazon bounced of the lower support time several times in recent weeks building higher lows. At the same time Amazon made lower highs since the Sept. 2 "crash". Amazon is poised to breakout soon. Last week was calendar week 50. Calender week 50 is from a historical perspective Amazon's worst by far. That being behind us now leaves us with a stronger momentum, especially when Christmas is over and with regards to the upcoming FY2020 report late January.

&amp;#x200B;

[seasonality of Amazon's stock, gay circle is CW50](https://preview.redd.it/bj2mpu1zss461.jpg?width=1384&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14949b76c48efe273895f91429235d6a816cc798)

Short term, Amazon also made some green hammers into the close on Thu and Fri which leaves me hopeful on a strong momentum for next week if not the Pfizer vaccine news crashes the stay-at-home-stocks entirely (Amazon unjustified as it did not rally some 500% like those mentioned before but rather 43%). But: No matter what might happen in the short or medium term, Amazon will be on a moon mission with papa Bezos being rocketman on his dick shaped space needle. 

Thanks for reading.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: Amazon to the moon.

Title: If you trade on a broker that has O T C's (not robinhood), you should be buying MMEDF ASAP
 Listen up retards:

MMEDF (Mind Medicine) is currently trading on O T C (its like a shittier version of the NYSE, and had to add spaces so autmod doesnt auto ban this post). If the stock price can stay above 2 dollars for 5 straight trading sessions (Monday would be the 6th day, currently trading at 3.60), then it will be listed on NASDAQ. Once listed on NASDAQ, it will get in the hands of the Robinhooders, and we all know what they are capable of. This is very similar to how many of the cannabis stocks blew up.

This baby is an early stage meme stock. Don't underestimate how far the meme factor can push this thing. As far as meme stocks go though, MMED has a tier 1 management team and advisory board, including Mr. Wonderful aka Kevin Oleary (that bald asshole on sharktank) and Canopy Growth (weed stock) founder is on the board, Bruce Linton. They are also smartly conducting trials on an array of molecules (LSD, MDMA, DMT, Psilocybe) rather than putting all their eggs in one basket. This reduces the ticker's risk profile IMO.

Also, listen to this: the CEO recently said that Mind Medicine will be "the tesla of mental health", i know you guys like the sound of that! 

[https://money.yahoo.com/mindmed-creating-tesla-mental-health-143849890.html](https://money.yahoo.com/mindmed-creating-tesla-mental-health-143849890.html)

This treatment is d i s r u p t i v e AF to the mental health treatment industry. Psychedelics has been shown to be incredibly helpful in treating many complex mental health issues (PTSD, depression, etc.) much more effectively than traditional pharma treatment. 

TL:DR - Mind med is about to be added to NYSE aka robinhood-ville, and it will meme and moon, get in before that happens for max gains. In addition, it's a good investment long term

Title: Intrinsic value of Lumen (LUMN) with possible 10X return. Last time I tell you chumps about this one.
Look, I know everyone here only cares about high tech meme stocks valued at 10X the entire market for their shitty products. But if you have the tiniest amount of patience there might be an opportunity with limited downside to capitalize on a severely undervalued company according to many analysts including Michael Burry, the autist from The Big Short.   
   
Here are some choice quotes from The Investors Podcast (linked below):   

"So our premise really is that as long as people wake up to the fact that the core assets of Level 3 are worth what they are worth in the private market for, lets say, around $34 billion. And as long as people apply even some modicum of multiple to the remaining CenturyLink assets, you have a completely insane risk reward from 950 or whatever its trading at today. So thats kind of some of the parts we look at how to value or approach value in the company. And again for us, its more about margin of safety. So our margin of safety really is that, look, if someone offered me $1.7 billion in cash flow today, and I only have to pay 10 billion to get it, I would take that bet. Thats it in a nutshell."   
  
There is also a rumor that the company might split its two businesses to capitalize on the multiple that its Level 3 infrastructure should be receiving:   
"I mentioned that we have this hypothesis that the companys in the middle of splitting these two companies up and its messy. This was a messy merger. There are a lot of physical assets. There are little things that you have to figure out transfer pricing in between if you sell your fiber assets, if the company split the split off company is still using the fiber assets, you have to figure out transfer pricing. And so Im not saying its simple, but given this is a company that people know, Seattle Seahawks Stadium is a CenturyLink field, right? And so this is a company people know, we have a CEO who is highly incentivized to create value for shareholders whos done it before. And one more point, you go to their June, 2020 presentation for the first time wed ever seen, they put in a slide that said, Hey, we know we have a $10 stock, but here are some appropriate multiples we have for our two businesses.   

The estimate is $24-25 valuation based on a 4-5X fair multiple of EBITDA for this company:   
Hey, so you have three billion in EBITDA here at Level 3, you have six billion EBITDA at CenturyLink, lets put just conservative multiples on those illustrative of what these companies could be worth. And so this is a company that had a $10 stock that was saying, We think were worth 24 to 35. I mean, these are numbers that you almost dont put out there because people think thats so crazy."    

And maybe they are crazy. But options are so darn cheap that in my non-investment advice giving opinion its worth a flyer. There are two possible catalysts coming (1) announcement of splitting two companies up or (2) just outperforming expectations in Q1, which management is already on track to doing. The company has already consolidated debt significantly in the last year. Institutions own 79.6% of the stock, up 1.9% this quarter.  

Unlike you retards I can  this straight through expiry. I have patience and I want to be ahead of the game. When you come fashionably late to the memestock party you just get dumped on. Patience. As Warren Buffet said "the money is made in the waiting."

Title: CRSR - WSB's Next Millionaire Maker Big play
**CRSR -** Corsair Gaming should be looked at again for WSB's next big play. WSB was high on CRSR after earnings and hit a ATH high of $51.37 earlier last month and is currently trading 35% below its ATH. With the success WSB has had on bringing in retail investors and media recognition, CRSR could easily double from current levels. Let me break out why

**IPO and history:** CRSR ipo'ed back in August 21, 2020. Selling 14 million shares to investors/retail (This float will be important later on) at a price of $17. The stock traded mostly sideways until its first earning report where it blew out estimates on November 10th and rallied from $27 to $51 in a 14 day span.

**Revenue Growth:** CRSR has been growing revenues rapidly year over year, with 17% growth from 2018 (937M) to 2019 (1.1B). CRSR is on track for its best year yet with revenues YTD 9 months of 1.1B and Q4 earnings coming up expecting revenues in the $450m+ (low on guidance, I expected $600m+) range due to the Christmas sales bump/blackfriday/cyber moday. Representing 55% revenue growth from prior year and drastically exceeding its computer accessory peers. (LOGI 11% 2019 growth and 6.3% 2020 revenue growth) This factor alone should pay dues in its upcoming earnings  come February 2021.

**Valuation to competitors:** 

LOGI: 15B market cap - 3B annual sales (6.3% annual growth) Price to sales: 5.06

CRSR: 3B market cap - 1.66B+ annual sales (51% annual growth) Price to sales 1.91

**Inventory:** CRSR has expanded its production facilities over the past year and began to stock pile inventory for the upcoming increase in demand during holiday season (christmas, black friday, cyber monday). Inventory levels of 210m Sept 2020 vs 144M June 2020. All old inventory on the books went on fire sale and were on the top deals pages for slick deals/walmart/amazon. With prices slashed up to 50% off these items were quick to sell out and these sales will be reflected in the upcoming earnings call. Guidance was forecasted at 450M for upcoming quarter, which is on the safe side and inline with their Q3 earnings but I expect it to blow these estimates out of the water and coming in at the 600M+ range which would be inline with their quarterly sales growth excluding holiday sales bump (generally a 15% increase in sales from Q3.

**Margin Growth and turning a profit**: CRSR has been implementing economies of scale and recent revenue growth to begin to turn a profit. CRSR has gone net income in Dec 2019 of 6m to 36m as of September 2020. 

**Balance sheet:** CRSR has a strong balance sheet with no red flags. Consistent increasing cash positions, Strong working capital, Increased inventory levels for the holiday season rush and minimal debt. The IPO raised238 million dollars from the proceeds and was directly applied toward their debt. Reducing it from 500m to 370m. Which should be paid off by the end of 2022. They are cashflow positive and will no longer need any cash injections/share offerings in the future.

**Recent Sell off:**  

Taking profits: People who rode the stock up from earnings from $27 bucks to $51 taking profits and investing in other hot sectors EV/SPAC/IPOs. The dry up on volume has resulted in this stock heavily following the SPY.

Analyst Downgrade: Cowen &amp; Co downgraded the stock with a price target of $37 causing it to drop 15% early last week, stating the risk is to high with its recent run up and is overvalued compared to LOGI. (see analysis above, on a price to sales where CRSR is currently trading at below 2 P/S compared to LOGI at above 5 P/S

&amp;#x200B;

**FLOAT!!!!!!!:** The main reason this should be WSB's next play is its tiny float. Of the total 91.92m shares outstanding only 17.79M represent the public float which was offered during their IPO. The remainder of the float is still locked up until February 22,2021. 

Of this 17.79m Float institutions own 14.47m (all purchased between October 19th to November 27th)

Some key holders include -

BlackRock: 2.16m shares

JP Morgan : 1.96m shares

Massachusetts financial : 1.55m shares

Citadel advisors : 1.9m shares

JPM small growth : 1.27m shares

FMR: 1.06m shares

The remaining public float is sitting at **3.32 million shares for a 3 billion dollar company**.  This stock can be manipulated and pumped by our autistic forces easily. Which is one of the reasons why this stock ran to $50 bucks on minimal volume. (this was before institutions loaded up, will be even easier to pump a second time around)

**Short interest:** 1.6 million shares are currently shorted (50% of the active float), these shorts will have to call at the first sign of another run up, sending this to the moon.

**Bid/Ask spreads:** the daily spread on this stock is alone is anywhere from .7% to 1.2% which further proves how tight of a float we have here. Once we get our autists to slap the ask we will see this thing pump 15-20% days.

**TLDR: CRSR is generating record revenue growth and undervalued to its peers (LOGI), has a strong balance sheet and to kick it off has a public traded float of 3.3m which will send this stock flying the moment we get behind it. Calls are relatively cheap due to recent sell off and volume drying up. Best case we send this back to ATH's where it should be, worst case you have money invested in a undervalued company that will crush earnings come early February.**

Title: NIO
We saw NIO hit an all time high in the high 58s before coming crashing down to close at $41 today. What happened?

  Andrew Left of Citron broke momentum by posting a price target of $25 for NIO. This was the first big event that caused NIO to plummet, although it did rebound, but many retail and boomer investors were scared off.

Then the House passed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. This bill realists foreign stocks that dont uphold the standard American GAAP American accounting standard. This brought Chinese stocks and NIO under $50 for the first time in weeks. This is super irrational as NIO has been compliant ever since the Senate passed this bill months ago (they even use the same auditer that Tesla uses).

At this point, NIO is being way undervalued and the selloffs were caused by really irrational things and NIO should be a buy already.

All looked well and NIO was consolidating at $45-$47 before two days ago. Then NIO announced a $5B stock issuing (which only diluted shares by 5%) and everyone freaked out and paper handed till NIO sits at the $41 it is sitting at right now.

Well what will this $5B be used for. Rumor has it that NIO will be using it to expand in foreign markets soon and building infrastructure in Europe, etc.  if this turns out to be true this could be a huge catalyst for another NIO rally.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/cntechpost.com/2020/12/12/nio-is-closer-to-entering-overseas-markets/amp/

Other potential causes for a major NIO rally include NIO Day on 1/4 (think of Tesla Battery Day but chinese) 
And the fact that NIO is showing a pennant forming right now. Dont want to link an Imgur, but trust me. It sold off a couple times and is consolidating rn, prime for a breakout. Breakout could happen by end of next week according to my calculations.

NIO is at a deep discount right now, levels we havent seen since early November so be prepared for a major moon soon

Positions:
110 NIO shares

Title: An alternative hypothesis for PSTH + Stripe, for the betterment of the world
Greetings fellow retards,

I would like to submit for your consideration the following hypothesis: **a spin-off of a Financial Crime Enforcement division from within Stripe as a publicly owned company through Bill Ackman's SPAC.**

After having my mind totally shattered the last few days by watching some of the most insane biopharma pumping and dumping upon the Actual Stupids that inhabit stocktwits.com go down in real time (and getting banned from the platform in the process), I decided to clear my head for a while and then have a good think about the forgotten jewel of my autistic eye, Pershing Square Tontine Holdings.

This hypothesis should be read as an optimist's case that could possibly tie together a number of disparate threads into a sort of unified field theory about the roles that a SPAC like PSTH specifically and an infrastructure behemoth like Stripe will have in building the economic future of the internet. If you feel like immediately dismissing this post because of [this exchange](https://imgur.com/azcdTT3) or because your brain don't work good for other reasons, please exit the  immediately.

To start with [Bill Ackman](https://imgur.com/a/wwofHhU), I mean, just look at the man. You would let this silver fox impregnate your wife if he showed up at the door because you are, like me, A F*gg0t Who Cares Too Much (or if you please, a ). It'd probably make her happy and you'd get a kid way smarter than the wretched spawn you've loosed from your own loins out of the deal, too.

Anyway, for those who somehow still don't know this, Ackman is an activist investor and one of the more unconventional thinkers operating in the cesspool known as Wall Street. He's probably best known for two things: 1) his COVID crash short that was a [literal hundred bagger] (https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2020/03/25/billionaire-bill-ackman-100-fold-return-on-coronavirus-hedge-2-billion/?sh=6f49d29e6fcc) and 2) a short position that blew up in his face to the tune of $1 billion, which he took against the very cool and very legal company that is definitely not a pyramid scheme, Herbalife.

If you've been paying attention to Ackman's last few days on Twitter, [he's been busy putting the screws to the big credit card companies](https://imgur.com/ZHsjkAP), with some apparent [success](https://imgur.com/kOq2H8E), for servicing Pornhub, known destination for pedo creeps. As someone who has spent the last year and a half slowly losing sanity while learning as much as I can about one [Jeffrey Edward Epstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein), a network of events and financial institutions that support this hypothesis starts to take shape here.

Famously, Epstein hung around a lot of people at the highest echelons of so-called "polite" society, appears to have been some kind of intelligence honeypot meant to blackmail sick rich fucks (look up the origins of the CIA if you want to know more about this), and [most definitely did not kill himself with the toilet paper thin sheets that they give you in the clink](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7855039/Graphic-photos-Jeffrey-Epsteins-autopsy-reveal-bloodied-neck.html) **(warning: dead guy pics within)**. He had close working relationships with [JP Morgan Chase](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/business/jeffrey-epstein-business-wall-street.html) and [Deutsche Bank](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/07/jeffrey-epstein-case-deutsche-bank-fined-150-million-penalty-for-relationship.html), which both have [conspicuously small positions](https://imgur.com/b4dOMkL) in PSTH, as well as [Goldman Sachs](https://www.wsj.com/articles/jeffrey-epstein-burrowed-into-the-lives-of-the-rich-and-made-a-fortune-11564092553), which is totally absent. I should probably note [that Ackman's wife did receive some Epstein bucks through the MIT Media Lab](https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/neri-oxman-jeffrey-epstein-13236/) and that Ackman looks to have tried to [bury that story,](https://www.axios.com/joi-jeffrey-epstein-ties-mit-media-lab-professor-8384aa42-32d4-42dc-a0eb-54e23bcdee3a.html) which is ***very not cool***. Anyway, enough about Epstein (go listen to TrueAnon if you want to get yourself some of the same psychic damage that I have about him ). 

Bank ownership of PSTH seems weirdly low in general except for [Wells Fargo](https://imgur.com/I3mrEiM), which strikes me as odd when considering that the top known holder is of PSTH is Guggenheim, which has been historically [jacked to the tits](https://imgur.com/gRaf649) with holdings from the finance sector, but trimmed those positions considerably after the financial crisis.

By this point you may be finding yourself asking "how the fuck does all this relate to Stripe, you schizoid freak?" to which my response is that the [banks themselves](https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/) are the biggest financial crime doers in the world and with institutions like [Deutsche and JP Morgan](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-21/highlights-from-the-fincen-files-on-banks-suspect-transactions) being particularly egregious offenders, Ackman could be using his big fucking brain to cook up the future of public accountability in finance.

Consider the recent toothlessness of the organizations theoretically in charge of maintaining compliance with financial laws. There are examples that directly are relevant to everyone here who uses Robinhood (which picked [fucking Goldman Sachs](https://www.reuters.com/article/robinhood-ipo/exclusive-trading-app-robinhood-hires-goldman-sachs-to-lead-ipo-sources-idUSL1N2IO2TN) to lead their IPO). This includes their failure to disclose their practice of [selling order flow](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-free-trading-on-robinhood-isnt-really-free-1541772001), for which they were fined a [piddly $1.25 million by FINRA](https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases/2019/finra-fines-robinhood-financial-llc-125-million-best-execution). Robinhood's [top buyer of order flow is a little company called Citadel,](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1m2p1cv68bx56/Twitter-Freaked-Out-Over-Robinhood-Selling-Its-Trade-Flow-But-the-App-and-Others-Have-Been-Doing-It-for-Years) which was fined [a mere $700,000](https://imgur.com/0yT6vpJ) for using this data to snipe retail orders from retards like you and your cousin Billy using [high frequency trading algorithms](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/091615/world-high-frequency-algorithmic-trading.asp), which is called frontrunning and is ***extremely not cool and extremely not legal*** (but crime definitely pays). For a company whose literal mission statement is to ["democratize finance for all,"](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/our-mission/) Robinhood sure does seem to put their finger on the scale in ways that unquestionably favor the big guys and by extension, themselves. By the way, the concept selling of order flow was invented by a dude you may have heard of who is currently serving a 150 year sentence for running a giant Ponzi scheme and will well-deservedly die in prison in the middle of Fucking Nowhere, [Bernard Madoff](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paymentoforderflow.asp). Don't you wish the regulators would get off their knees, get the market maker dicks out of their mouths, and do their jobs?

Now we return to Stripe. If you've ever bought anything on the internet, you've probably used Stripe to process the payment, even if you didn't realize it at the time. Stripe could wind up being one of the biggest and most valuable companies in the world if they play their cards right, and big brain haver [Paul Graham thinks they could wind up being the next Google in terms of valuation.](https://imgur.com/am4ONjr) Stripe is thought to [be valued somewhere from $70-100 billion right now](https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/28/what-to-make-of-stripes-possible-100-billion-valuation/), and we know that Ackman has about $7 billion in his war chest. I'd wager it's likely that the recent spate of IPOs by dog shit companies like AirBnB and DoorDash giving them ~$80 billion and ~$55 billion market caps respectively pushes Stripe's valuation toward the higher end of those current valuation estimates. Also take note of the second tweet in that screenshot, because it's strikes me as being not altogether dissimilar to what Ackman has previously said about what he thinks was his biggest miss going long, [Mastercard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxqTwpWizw4).

Stripe offers an [expansive and rapidly growing](https://imgur.com/OUSWYZi) anti-financial crimes platform called [Radar](https://stripe.com/radar) and is actively hiring for roles that seem like they'll be mission critical for the future of a company that's growing globally like [this one](https://stripe.com/jobs/listing/financial-crimes-investigation-payment-methods-lead-apac-chinese-speaker/2351914). They've already built the infrastructure that huge swathes of the internet economy run on and they're just getting rolling. 

Given the utter levels of incompetence bordering on malfeasance by the syphilitic boomers with worm-filled brains that supposedly regulate finance, is it so implausible that an avowed optimist and guy who definitely thinks about this stuff more than you, [Patrick Collison,](https://imgur.com/5zwzFPm) would team up with the man running the [most investor-friendly SPAC ever](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/22/ackman-pershing-square-taking-no-compensation-for-new-spac-investment-vehicle.html) to truly bring the fight for equality of financial opportunity to the free market? I don't think so. Such an act would help subvert the power of creeps like [Ken Griffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_C._Griffin), who almost certainly believes that you and everyone you love are pathetic little worms that live in a world belonging to him and his buddies.

**TLDR: An offshoot of Stripe could still be the target and the merger of PSTH with Stripe Radar as an independent, publicly owned entity, could be a step toward truly democratizing the markets and saving America and the rest of the world from the leviathan of Big Capital.** 


Positions: short puts and long shares + March calls of PSTH in my active trading account, along with ~25% of my Roth IRA currently allocated to PSTH shares with the intention to sell about half of my mutual fund holdings after the next dividend goes out and put all of that money into PSTH.

Title: The next Nicotine free 10 Bagger $XXII$
 

This company is a biotech company that makes modified tobacco for cigarettes and cannabinoids in hemp or something.

Lets cut to the tendies.

Basically there is speculation that the company will receive MRTP status, which enables the company to be the only company to sell and market VLN cigarettes. (which have 95% less nicotine in their tobacco)

Not to mention the FDA just ordered 3.6 million of their spectrum cigarettes, Which the FDA is interested in because there is apparently a push to require cigarettes to contain minimal nicotine from this quote on their website.

" The Companys research cigarettes will continue to fuel numerous independent, scientific studies to validate the enormous public health benefits identified by the FDA and others of implementing a national standard requiring all cigarettes to contain minimally or non-addictive levels of nicotine. "

TLDR:

Company receive MRTP = Tendies

More Tobacco regulations = Tendies

Their CEO just bought 100k shares last month

33 a share and a newly traded co. Any reason to believe it cant get as big as logitech and grow 5x where its at now within 1 to 3 yrs?? I feel like this is way too cheap am I missing something?

I know alot of people are bullish saying 40, 50, mayybe even 60 a share target. But why cant this go to $160+ a share. That would make it similar market cap to logitech? Thoughts?

Title: DIS is going higher.
Yes, yes I know they gapped up big. But just cause you missed the 155-175 run dont punish yourself and miss the rest.

This was the beginning of a re-evaluation of Disney as a business. Its going to be the leader in streaming, along with its massive parks, ESPN, sports/gamblling, IP, toys, merchandise content business. Remember Netflix 222B and all it does is provide streaming. Disneys streaming growth outpaces Netflix's by an order of magnitude. Remember Disney + was announced a fucking year ago. 1 year and they are projecting quarter BILLION subs by 2024.

Now smooth brains will say "oh they dont make any money streaming". Thats naive and shortsighted. They pull people into the Disney universe. Disney famously makes a killing on gay shit for neckbeard like Star Wars action figures, comic books, t shirts, even stuff like cereal and happy meals and all this shit. Content and IP is priceless. Everyone from the day they were born to the day they die consume Disney content.

Huge gap up today on 87m volume. For reference the day before it had 8m volume. That means institutions are buying. And institutions dont buy to hold 1 day or 1 week or even 1 year, 175 is the new low. 200 is a magnet, and then beyond that 

in time. They dominate streaming now, and this is before they roll out their new Star Wars, Marvel, etc content. 

I think in due time, their streaming business will be valued at more than Netflix (currently 222B for NFLIX). This is hardly a stretch. Mkt is future oriented. Look at how TSLA barely sells any cars but they are the most valuable automaker by far, because market knows they will dominate in the future.

Hard to not choose Disney as the early winner of the streaming war, even though it hasn't happened yet. But hard to compete with literally like a hundred years worth of original content which Netflix simply cant compete with. Yeah House of Cards and Stranger things is cool, but kids want to watch Lion King, Tarzan then grow into teens who wanna watch Iron Man and Captain America. Netflix cant compete, there's nothing they can do. America literally grows up on Disney.

Oh, and they make billions on parks (vaccine is here), they own ESPN, and even have a stake in Draft Kings.

This is a unique opportunity, because its now a high growth stock AND a blue chip. Their moat is maybe one of the strongest ever. Its fucking Disney. Their are kids in Gyna, Africa who play Mickey Mouse and watch the lion king. The dominate the movie industry, own Fox which produces art house films to Marvel, to Star Wars to jungle book and everything in between.

Most of these meme stocks go up on pure hopium and no earnings. This a blue chip with extremely high growth.

Positions: 2022, 220 or 240 LEAPs.

Bonus: someone bought 1.1M shares in after hours today. Thats about 200 million. For context, a 200m position in a hedge fund like Bridgewater would be 8% of their holdings, roughly a top 5 holding.

Title: $VSPR HydraFacial - Major Becky Stock + Undervalued SPAC set to 
 ***My position: 25,000 warrants at $2/share - $50,000 bet***

Alright fellow tards listen up. $VSPR is a SPAC that has officially announced a merger with Hydrafacial. I know what you're going to say: tHiS iS a gIrL sToCk or wHaT aBoUt PLTR aNd GME?!

Well...go talk to your girlfriends or mommys or the insta model you whack it to about HydraFacial. I'm here to make big money. This is a prime Becky stock ready to moon once you and the fellow bros on Wall Street figure it out. While we've all been playing with ourselves buying GME, Becky stocks like $ALGN, $LULU, $PTON, and $ULTA have crushed it this year. Women spend tons of money on health, wellness, and beauty, and this one is massively underpriced compared to those ones.

**What is VSPR and HydraFacial?**

[Here is a link to their investor presentation](https://2y7msb2elfoj22q7jr2xnc83-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Project-Hydrate-Investor-Presentation_vFinal.pdf)

Long story short, HydraFacial is a new and more natural alternative to Botox. It's a natural skincare product where salons will treat customers skin with serums that will clean, extract, and hydrate skin to make it look younger, reduce wrinkles, and give skin a "glow". Look up reviews for it...Google, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter...all are great feedback. 99% "worth it" rating on RealSelf.

VSPR is a $460M SPAC led by Allergan CEO and Jim Cramer butt-buddy and Brent Saunders. Saunders did a great job as CEO of Allergan and grew the business through making great acquisitions. He has been in the cosmetic industry for decades and he knows his shit, certainly wouldnt have picked HydraFacial unless the product was legit. He and Cramer are legitimately best buds...you'll want to get in before the inevitable Cramer pump. They are forking over $460M and leading a $350M PIPE to buy HydraFacial at a $1.1B valuation.

**Financials**

HydraFacial makes money selling both the dispensers for the system which lasts 7 years and makes up 49% of revenue, and the other 51% of revenue is the single-use serums.

In 2019 they were at $167M of revenue with 52% CAGR, and $41M EBITDA with 38% CAGR. Margins are around 20%-25%. They're targeting $250M in rev in 2022. This deal will give them an extra $100M of cash on the balance sheet and get their debt down to $0. That's right, **this is a profitable SPAC with $0 in debt**

**Growth Opportunity**

This thing is primed for growth in the next 5-10 years. They're already growing at over 50% YOY and were able to have record deliveries even in the middle of COVID when a lot of salons were closed.

They don't just have market share...they ARE the market. They have created this category in the beauty industry. They are the "Kleenex" of this industry; HydraFacial is now both their brand and synonymous for the process of hydrating facial treatment. They have 38 patents on their products so that they will continue to corner this market as it grows.

The youngins fucking love this treatment. They have a massive social media presence (\~$2.3B media impressions, 16% instagram engagement rate). About 50%-60% of their users are millennials, and the average user gets 4 treatments per year. Just like botox, this is a recurring treatment with recurring revenue for HydraFacial. As influencers and social media keeps making us look at ourselves in a camera...these products are going to be needed.

Oh yeah, did I mention they're in 87 counties?! Their biggest market is the US, but they are predicting a much larger and faster growth in the Asia market.

**Valuation**

This deal sits them at *$1.1B, about 4.6x 2022 revenue*. Yeah that's high, but so is this goddamn market. Shit, Nikola pushed a truck down a hill and QS hasn't built a goddamn thing yet and they're worth billions. This market wants future growth, and this company has plenty it.

It's hard to get an exact comparable valuation since they are a new player in a new market. If we're going with the Becky market they are massively undervalued compared to their peers and they have better growth:

(Align 9.0x rev, LULU 6.9X rev, L' Oreal 5.3x rev, Estee Lauder 5.2x rev).

I own a large amount of $ALGN which popped over 100% just because some TikTokers use their product. LULU and PTON...huge becky stocks that are crushed during the pandemic. This is all the new rage with the younger female generation and this is the ALGN of skincare.

**What's the play?**

Fuck can't believe you read this far. This is a SPAC. SPAC market has been retarded lately, nothing but moons. Wall Street hasn't caught up to this one yet because its not an EV SPAC. If you don't know how SPACs work...learn how to Google things, but essentially they all start at $10/share and have a $10 floor. That's right, you CAN'T GO BELOW $10. This offers an insanely low risk for a SPAC that is going to take off.

The stock (or "commons") are trading at $10.65...offering a very low downside. Even better, the warrants (essentially a call option for SPACs) are trading at $2 which is stupid cheap for a SPAC that's announced a target. Warrants are more volatile but offer a ton of upside. I set a limit at $2 today and it fucking hit. I can't believe I got them that cheap.

These warrants WILL hit $3 easy as they get closer to their merger. This one will start to get more attention and start to climb, and I'll be at $3 or probably closer to $4 or $5 in a month. Like I said, Cramer fucking LOVES this CEO and will 100% have him on Mad Money to jerk this thing higher. You'll want to get in on these warrants before that happens.

**Buy VSPR or VSPRW (warrants) and thank me when you're rich.**

Title: A Meme StockBut Also Fundamentally Solid: APXT
My fellow delinquents, I present to you the fundamental case for a meme stock thats been floated around this sub: APXT

What does it mean to have good fundamentals? It means that in addition to this stock getting lumped into the meme category and generating ridiculously fat tendies in the near-term, theres also a sense of comfort from the downside protection (a foreign concept to many of us) the fundamentals of the company provide. As youll see below, at its current valuation, there is significant runway for APXT to go up on pure fundamentals that you can quantify and comfortably defend, and not purely on speculative hype that a lot of these other meme stocks seem to be propped up on.

Since a lot of other posts in this sub cover what the company does, Ill be brief. APXT is a SPAC to bring the company AvePoint public. AvePoint is a SaaS data management company that basically provides security offerings and solutions to plug holes associated with data transfer within the Microsoft Office cloud solutions. In other words, they help migrate, manage, and protect data in Microsoft 365. You can definitely read more in other threads, I think they do a good job with the qualitative stuff. The main takeaway is that its a legit business that has many diversified blue-chip customers and operates in an industry with strong tailwinds. Now, onto the good stuff.

The hardest part of any investment is not determining whether a company is good or bad, its is it worth the price? Once the qualitative checkboxes are checked off (e.g., this company isnt committing fraud, its not losing to competition, isnt levered to the tits with debt, etc.), which they are for APXT, investors typically look at a few metrics for these software businesses to determine the appropriate valuation. These are TAM (Total Addressable Market), growth, recurring revenue, profitability, and churn, among others.

**APXT TAM**: $33 billion (represents if all potential customers bought all available your products)

**APXT Revenue Growth**: 25% per year (30% on a recurring revenue basis)

**APXT Recurring Revenue**: \~78% of total revenue (2020); this represents subscription revenue that customers contractually pay year over year (e.g., spotify charges on a subscription based model while video games that you buy once are changed on a license/one-time revenue model)

**APXT Profitability**: 14% EBIT margin (% of revenue that is kept as profits before the impact of interest expense (which there are none) and taxes)

**APXT Churn**: N/A unfortunately

**APXT Balance Sheet**: Looks clean  no debt, $252M of cash

Based on all these metrics, you get a pretty complete financial profile for the business that you can compare to other publicly traded peers to triangulate around an appropriate valuation. Here is a sample of other high growth SaaS companies:

  

https://preview.redd.it/lcz1w3bu8n461.png?width=853&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbd0d103fb750a4eaacc97323d108b31a2085466

As you can see, APXT fits into this comp set quite well in terms of growth, profitability, TAM, and recurring revenue, though it is somewhat smaller in terms of revenue. But what about price? The everyday analogous way to think about price or valuation is shopping for clothes (or anything, really). Of course a custom tailored Italian suit complemented with Gucci loafers is going to be a much doper outfit than an oversized white Old Navy t-shirt complemented with oversized jhorts you got from Goodwill, but it also is going to cost you 1000x as much. Same principle applies to company valuations. Unfortunately there are no price tags on stocks  its a bit more complicated than just comparing straight up stock prices. You have to look at the stock price (x) the number of outstanding shares, which gets you the market cap, or the equity value. Then you have to add net debt (total debt minus cash). This resulting sum is called the companys enterprise value (EV) and represents the worth of the entire company. For companies like these that have strong growth and no profits, the appropriate comparison to make is against each companys EV divided by its Revenue. This represents the value of the entire company (based on the stock price) relative to its revenue, a fundamental metric. Companies with similar profiles in terms of growth, recurring revenue, etc. should have similar multiples. Going back to the previous clothing example, the suit + Gucci sleds are much better than the Big and Tall sloppy seconds, but once you normalize for the price (e.g., looking at the price divided by fundamental metric like quality of clothing), the relative advantage of the suit becomes much more muted. If the suit was just as cheap as the t-shirt and jhorts, then youd obviously buy the former, because the price / fundamental metrics ratio is much lower. Same concept here with APXT. Lets look at the same table above, except now with the EV / Revenue multiples

  

https://preview.redd.it/1zpgx0qx8n461.png?width=853&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e6419e322dbfdb5a90d71ce905c781761ed798c

As you can see, APXT has strong fundamental stats, and is relatively cheap (at 17.4x vs average of 20.8x), suggesting it is a good buy.

For those who say these companies arent comparable on the basis of size  I completely hear you. All the comps listed here are bigger than APXT despite sharing otherwise similar characteristics. Okta and Ping both operate in security and the last 3 companies are direct companies APXT mentions in their investor presentation as having comparable profitability and growth above a certain size metric. For what its worth, Ive done separate analyses showing that size isnt a strong predictor of valuation (its more so growth and other fundamental metrics). 

To summarize, at $14.33 a share (closing price at 12/11/20), the company is worth \~$2.6B EV, representing a \~17.4x EV / Revenue multiple. For a SaaS company growing at 25% in a large market benefiting from strong tailwinds that has already achieved profitability, this multiple is somewhat conservative (read: low), and I can see it going much higher given the current market environment. Two years ago, I would never have dreamed of calling a company trading at 17x Revenue conservative, but times change and in the era of companies like DoorDash IPOing for absurd valuations (27x revenue), its certainly not unfathomable for a company like this to trade up to 25x, which translates to \~$19/share, representing a 33% upside from where its trading at today.

Title: NIO Present&amp;Future
Since there are lot of posts about nio i decided to put my 5 cents opinion, cause here it is either buy weekly 5P or 80C

I am in for almost a year when it was pretty unpopular stock without hype and i did not sell a shit even at ATH or now nor i plan to. Nio maybe mooned on EV hype and shit but fundamentals do not lie. Maybe they do not sell hundred thousands vehicles a year (yet) but they sit on technologies that are far more advanced that any other ev company has done. Battery swaps net that assure you can drive half a china without needed to stop for several hours recharge is so huge and imo it is still not fully priced in. Their expansion to europe is coming and if they are able to build samelike battery swaps stations net in europe its something even unbelievable huge to describe.

What we hate at evs the most and propably why many people still not buy them are that after few hundred miles you gotta waste several hours standing on some shitass gas station recharging battery. So the answer is solid state battery or battery swap stations.

Mark cap now: 50B 
Mark cap if the expansion to europe,compliance with US and improved margin numbers: 500B is not crazy to think of

Tl;DR 
SHORT TERM: buy puts or short it, idk

For LONGTERM  (and with a little bit of luck):  100C leaps,stocks, whatever u want

or you can bet on solid state batter: QS

Title: New Amazon and DHL EV truck stock $GIK  
GIK is officially merging with Lightning eMotors. **Their customers are Amazon, DHL, IKEA, Keurig/Dr Pepper** and many other big companies that buy their electric delivery vans as you can see in the [investor presentation](https://www.gigcapitalglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/Project-Power-Announcement-Deck_vF.pdf). 

Additionally to the delivery vans they are also making [larger trucks](https://lightningemotors.com/lightningelectric-chevrolet-6500xd/) as well as [buses](https://lightningemotors.com/buses/). With Biden as a president we will see a heavy demand for this type of electrified vehicles and a lot of states will roll out their own programs to subsidize companies which invest into electric vehicles. And they also develop and distribute their own charging infrastructure like Chargepoint and EVbox: [https://lightningenergy.biz/dc-charging-stations](https://lightningenergy.biz/dc-charging-stations)

This is the only company which provides everything for commercial customers to quickly electrify large fleets and to run them cost efficient and reliable. They are backed by big oil, BP invested $40 million in them. In the US alone there were [12.4 million commercial vehicles sold in 2019](https://www.statista.com/statistics/265914/commercial-vehicle-sales-in-the-united-states/).

This is a HUGE untapped market which isn't addressed by Tesla yet, and there already is more demand for electric delivery vans [than can be fulfilled](https://www.autoblog.com/2020/09/09/electric-delivery-vans-high-demand).

**You might be wondering the best thing about this? It is the marketcap of the transaction which values Lightning eMotors at just $800 million.** 

A stock price of $20 would mean a marketcap of just $1.6 billion, which is about 11% of what CIIC/Arrival is valued at trading at $30 ($15 billion). And only 23% of what NKLA is trading at right now. This stock might be the last EV stock this year that can easily double.

Title: NIO DD, bear time?
So you know it and I know it too, this market in general is absolutely absurd and crazy, some people call it a bubble, other people call it priced in, and other people call it free tendies. Right now here is a daily chart of spy

https://preview.redd.it/n19jyt9w8m461.png?width=847&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=177496ec05c3156a645730d701ef8150ede13916

For the past couple weeks we have been slowly inching higher and higher, but sentiment in the overal market is that we are all greedy and stuff, we are in a bubble yatta yatta gay bears prophesizing the crash that will never come. However, loooking at the 20 SMA(green line) there has been a historical record of price of the spy going down after it touches the green line. This dosent happen all the time like you can see in august and may but 4 out of the 6 times that this has happened spy went on to go down for a few days after touching the green line. Right now we are about to touch that green line, and so far we have been red for a bout 3 days(writing this as of 3 pm on friday idk if we close green now). This leads me to be a little bearish on the overall market. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now for NIO, this stock had a historic run where it constantly kept going up 10 percent every day and was free tendies with the hype of Electrical Vehicles, TSLA was also pumping and stonks only went up. Then PLTR came along and people ditched NIO the chinese EV company and PLTR went on to go massive up same as NIO, and NIO became less and less cool. Memes where spread, and not as many people where hype for NIO and went on to go full retard on PLTR cause tits literally couldn't go up. 

To get a clearer picture of NIO lets take a look at this intresting chart

&amp;#x200B;

[Daily chart from a YouTube video ZipTrader\(not current chart, price rn is around 41.80\)](https://preview.redd.it/1v3zwwhgam461.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db510d3a5c9b106997376b9d07cc55f03a79c02b)

SO we can see that according to this chart made from some random dude named ZipTrader, NIO price is mostly priced in by hype on NIO itself and EV hype. However you know it and I know it too, EV hype is dying, TSLA is going down, overall market is going down, and NIO hype is also going down. They arent many hot posts on this sub reddit anymore about NIO or pltr cause people tis are currently about to go up. Only hot post I could find was  this one, which will go into my main point.  

[Tesla chart comparable to NIO](https://preview.redd.it/egsp0z4ibm461.png?width=511&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9798f3876039a15990d73aad4e61bb9408657c5f)

So with this TSLA chart, on the point that u/sncsoccer pointed out, TSLA went down pretty hard before recovering afterwards. Now why did TSLA Go down in this point and time? My theory was that it was due to a head and shoulders pattern. Looking at the chart he posted, it looks pretty similar to one, but not exactly a head and shoulders. 

[Daily chart of TSLA near early 2020](https://preview.redd.it/43mk7kvbcm461.png?width=857&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe8437e8e704a970e6e594c1102115035dd732e9)

Looking at a better chart here, you can vaguely draw a head and shoulders, and here it worked but tbh this didnt really look too much like a head and shoulders with that left shoulder being so high, but never the less it worked in the scenario. But the real head and shoulders is on NIO. lets take a look at NIO

[NIO daily chart ](https://preview.redd.it/ieyhqj7mcm461.png?width=871&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32823eb77a091c55ba17ee062621b248723d5480)

Here is on this NIO chart is almost a perfect example of a head and shoulders, go look on your own at the chart and it will be clear as day. The shoulders, the head, the neck line, everything about it is perfect. Now for those of you who don't know what a head and shoulders are, its basically a bearish indicator where tits will go up and gay bears profit. Now that docent mean NIO has to go down or will go down 100 percent, but its a dam good bet after considering the spy chart, the tsla chart, the loss of hype on EV and NIO, and the bubble that we are in. I am predicting that NIO will go down to at least 40 dollars by the end of next week.

[Yahoo finance says NIO is bearish and detects bearish patterns](https://preview.redd.it/xfofacvqdm461.png?width=1898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2971aec9f9e3456efe335f5efd3260d24e83cdb7)

Even yahoo finance says that this stock is bearish and has said it detected a bearish pattern. This on its own isnt much but when you combine it with everything else I have said maybe it starts to make sense. Also you can see the head and shoulders on NIO clearer here. 

That being said, all of you diamond hand NIO people could still be fine even after this massive drill that I think is going to happen cause just like tsla, NIO will likely recover. However, if you have weekly calls or anything close that, you may be fucked so if I were you id get out while you still could(nothing in this post is financial advise pls don't sue).  

&amp;#x200B;

THE PLAY: NIO puts. I recommend getting something close to the money like the 40.5 put or the 40 put with about 3 weeks of time or more, but these can be a bit over priced right now since the stock is already down about 8 percent. If you are a bit more balsy and going WSB full YOLO mode then you could put money into the 39.5 put or even lower with even less time on the put, however, I recommend taking profits on this type of put very early since I think while it does have a good chance to go lower than 40 dollars, there isn't a guarantee that it will and also in that amount of time. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Puts on NIO, 40 strike 3 weeks of time or more, 39.5 strike put with less time if your feeling balsy. Tits can go up with NIO cause of the head and shoulders pattern on it and overall market is going down, EV Hype is dead, NIO hype is dead, Bubble burst happening soon, GAY bear time

&amp;#x200B;

nothing here is financial advise.

Title: TAK of the town
Ok boys and girls, tuck in your genitals and sit down. Ive gathered you here once again today to discuss a possible new meme: Takeda Pharmaceuticals. Ticker $TAK. 

Now, some of you may be familiar with this ticker, and may hold the opinion This shit does not move. And looking at the chart over the past few years, Id have a hard time disagreeing with you. 

Weve been in the $17-$20 range for quite a while now.
 So of course, you may be wondering the following: Whats new, and why the fuck am I reading this bullshit?

The non-retarded among you are familiar with ARK. ARK ETFs, led by Cathie Woods, has over the past 5 years been an absolute fucking money printing machine. Shes been very popular here as of late so Im sure many of you have read her name in some other DD posts.

 For those who arent aware, you can receive reports of recent trades ARK has made: https://ark-funds.com/investor-resources.

Over the past few days, ARKG has bought a large amount of TAK shares, substantially increasing their position (I believe over 1.6 million shares were purchased by ARKG over the past two weeks however I only have the trade reports for 12/9 and 12/10.), and the stock now makes up 1.43% of the ETF. 
https://imgur.com/a/vwHnvE3

Now what is it that ARK sees that the rest of the market doesnt?

Well, probably this: 
https://uk.reuters.com/article/takeda-pharma-drug-pipeline-idUKL4N2IP0MV

https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/takeda-s-says-pipeline-can-push-revenue-to-47-billion-by-2030

https://japantoday.com/category/business/Takeda-says-drug-pipeline-to-lift-sales-to-48-billion-in-next-decade   

(Same as the Reuters article, same journalist is the author.)

Takedas new drug pipeline should *explode* revenue, increasing by more than 50% over the next decade. Where is the revenue coming from? 

&gt; The majority of this revenue growth is expected to come from the companys Wave 1 pipeline, which includes 12 unique New Molecular Entities (NMEs), representing potential best-in-class/first-in-class therapies, and its existing 14 global brands. Of the Wave 1 programs, five have received Breakthrough Therapy designation and three were granted fast track designation by the US Food and Drug Administration. In addition, one program received designation under the SAKIGAKE Designation System by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and another program was the first breakthrough designation granted by the China Food and Drug Administration to a multinational biopharmaceutical company.

Now some of you may be hesitant. Takeda had some pretty impressive earnings at the beginning of the year and didnt move from them. Why would the stock move now?
 *Because Takeda is explicitly focusing on getting their stock to stop behaving like boomer trash.* 

&gt; Japans biggest drugmaker is trying to turn the spotlight on its growth prospects after its $59 billion takeover of Shire Plc, completed last year. Since the merger, the companys shares have underperformed domestic and global peers as it focused on selling $10 billion in non-core assets to reduce debt.

&gt;One of the questions that weve had to ask ourselves is, how can we help our investor base better understand our pipeline, and assume the same energy and enthusiasm that we have? research and development president Andy Plump said in an online briefing to analysts and media.

&gt;Takedas management is keenly aware of its poor stock performance and would like analysts to take a more bullish view of its pipeline, Jefferies analyst Stephen Barker wrote in a research note. But analysts may not be convinced until more data is available.

Options are incredibly cheap right now and IV is low. Cathie Woods is in on it. The company has rock solid financials and fundamentals and is actively courting investors. Any substantial pop will cause positions to rain tendies. Volume on 1/15/21 $20c is quite high, with 2.6k Volume and 10.9k OI. 

Im currently holding 175 contracts of 1/15/21 20c and plan on adding more on Monday/Tuesday as soon as more funds clear. Proof of positions + my bleeding SPY call FDs so you know Im not gay. https://imgur.com/a/zbilc52

Title: Buy $CCJ NOW! 20 JAN 23 15 C
The uranium market is set to tighten and prices about to rise significantly. Cameco is best placed to benefit significantly from this.

Here's an excerpt from a Morningstar report:

"Meanwhile, we expect global uranium demand to rise roughly 40% by 2025, a staggering amount for a commodity that saw next to zero demand growth in the past 10 years. We expect new reactor capacity to drive the strongest uranium demand growth in decades."

"Years of low spot prices have prevented investment in new mines, while existing mines have entered care and maintenance or are near the end of their lives. As such, the mined supply of uranium will struggle to keep pace amid rising demand and falling secondary supplies. Low uranium prices since Fukushima have left the project cupboard bare, and we expect a cumulative supply deficit to emerge by 2023."

"As one of the largest and lowest-cost producers globally with expansion potential, Cameco should benefit meaningfully from higher uranium prices. The company benefits from stellar ore grades, large scale, long life, and an attractive operating cost profile."

Title: Stock BFT. Next Square!?
All, for those interested in getting in on a small fintech play, BFT is taking paysafe public, This company will have a 9b dollar market cap and has tons of runway for growth.

BFT is the ticker.

BFT services huge companies: TWITCH, DRAFTKINGS, FORTNITE, SPOTIFY. It will grow as their customers grow.

Here is the investor presentation:

https://s25.q4cdn.com/579018173/files/doc\_presentations/2020/Foley-Trasimene-Acquisition-Corp.-II-and-Paysafe-investor-presentation.pdf](https://s25.q4cdn.com/579018173/files/doc_presentations/2020/Foley-Trasimene-Acquisition-Corp.-II-and-Paysafe-investor-presentation.pdf)

Proceed with caution. I think this could be an easy 30-40% gain after merger due to the low multiple of price to sales. Expected 2021 Revenue of 1.5B and a market cap of 9B.....

I bought some common stock.

Warrants are available.

Title: Your Tendie Stimulus IV: Dont Buy the Dip (yet), Jerome has forsaken us
**Yes, its true**.  The liquidity programs we've come to know and love--the true "pumps"are stagnating or contracting, and it's clear SPY doesn't like this.  We are our own out there people. Let me break down for you how and why that is; and what we can do to save our tendies.

*First, lets take a quick look at the vehicles that the FED has used to keep us propped up that Im referencing:*

**Overnight short-term loans (Repo, Reverse Repo operations)**
*What It Is*
[More detailed description I did back in the day here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcdpox/dd_playing_vxx_and_spy_against_the_fed_repo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), but this is the process by which the FED has been giving banks overnight loans so they could make asset purchases.  They used to give these loans to each other, but the process became fucked up and expensive and the FED stepped in to fix this by offering the loans themselves at a low rate.  Once the pandemic hit, they took the unprecedented step of offering the loans with zero additional interest for themselves, basically offering free money.
[0 basis points over IOER is nerd speak for fucking free money](https://i.imgur.com/tD780yn.jpg)
**-Did it work?  Yes.**  
Fed Policy typically takes a couple of months to affect the market.  With that in mind, you can see that the performance of SPY correlates with the interest rate and bid volume on overnight repo operations.  Free money policy was instituted in March, and the impact gained full strength in the spring.
[look at this insane Repo activity in early June when the loans were free money. SPY was +7% month to date!](https://i.imgur.com/3bwjqd5.jpg)

**Treasuries** 
I won't go too deep into treasury purchases and its effect on market activity, but the simplified version is this; **if the FED needs to flood the market with money by pushing people to invest in vehicles aside from safe, boomer treasuries, they will buy up the treasuries themselves.**  This raises the price of treasuries by starving the market, thus giving them less yield--in other words, making them less valuable.  With less yield, people turn to stocks.  That's an oversimplified version of how it works, but you get the gist; the FED buys treasuries so people buy stonks.
**-Did it work? Yes**.
Take a look at the yield rate on treasuries here.  [At this time in 2019, the 20 year yield was up as high as 2.2%](https://i.imgur.com/1fLBbE3.jpg).  But, take a look at what happens after March.  The Fed begins buying up the treasuries, and the yield goes down to .98 in April.  All you need to know is that means the yield on treasuries was dogshit so people were pressured to buy stonks.
"How do you know this was the Fed's doing?"
They said it.  [Here is one of many statements from the FED](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_200312a) saying "we are going to by the fuck out of treasuries at an increased rate because of COVID".  How increased?  Take a look at this photo, we are talking about an average of 10 or 20 billion dollars, to 80 million dollars a clip.
[treasury spending increased 3 fold](https://i.imgur.com/J08Av7D.jpg)

**Bond Repurchases**
In March the FED announced they would be buying corporate bonds in another major boost to available liquidity.  Just as SPY got shaky, it was an added boost immeditely after the June  crash (a crash, btw, caused by a change in the repo loan interest rates).  Basically, when large companies need money they issue bonds to shore up cash that are available to the public (same shit as treasuries, basically)--the FED is now buying those bonds.  This direct infusion of cash from the FED is about as close to outright buying stock in companies as you can get.
**Did it work? Yes**. 
See: June rebound.  Also google some of the types of companies they're buying bonds from.  There's a reason why the fact that nobody is paying rent hasn't caused a mortgage-backed credit crisis for major banks...yet.

*So, weve established the main tools the FED uses to prop up the market and that they work.  Whats the problem, and why am I saying JPOW has forsaken us?*

**Because the Feds balance sheet has been contracting, and with that these programs are no longer offering nearly as favorable terms as they once were, but the market isnt strong enough to handle those unfavorable terms.**

[heres a graph from the FED showing their flatlining balance sheet](https://i.imgur.com/CoRcfBb.jpg)
The FED is spending less overall than it was earlier this year (remember, it takes a couple months for spending policy to catch up in the market).  *This was bound to happen, but the problem is the key programs I mentioned are all at obviously ineffective levels and havent been increased.*
**a) Repo operations havent been at a lower cost interest level since July**, from +0 basis points over the standard interest rate, to +5--and on longer term loan operations +10.  The market has not responded kindly to losing their free money, looking at the monthly SPY charts.
**b) While generous, the treasuries purchases have stalled out at 80 million**.  More importantly, the FED hasn't facilitated any key changes to which terms they purchase (long v short, etc). The market has responded to this stagnation with stagnation, looking at the monthly SPY charts.
**c) Bond purchases not set to increase**: The FED is still purchasing bonds, but have also stagnated the rates of that along with the other two facilities.  Kaplan, the Dallas Fed Chair who's always running his mouth, has [indicated a lack of support for increased corporate bond purchases. ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/kaplan-says-hes-not-in-favor-of-fed-increasing-bond-purchases.html)

**What the contracting FED balance sheet, the stagnation of these increased liquidity programs, and the lackluster performance of SPY over the past three months combine to signal is that the market/SPY is NOT healthy enough on their own to continue its rise.  If you take the 5 day election bump out the picture, SPY has performed over 50% less than its aggregrate performance April-August.**

Why did I say don't buy the dip YET? Is help coming?  Yes.  Two options:
**1) The stimulus**: if enhanced UI benefits are improved, the spending in the consumer goods and credit market would provide a huge boost that could offset the economic effects of an increasingly bleek jobs situation.

**2) The FOMC meeting on the 16th**: this is where the FED would make any decisive changes on the lending programs mentioned here.  My guy /u/curiousmaniac pointed out to me that these changes, if they even happened, likely wouldn't come to fruition in the new year (even if the policy is changed on the 16th).

**So yeah, you might wanna chill on SPY. I hear you saying where was this BEFORE TODAY?! REVISIONIST HISTORY**
-[here's my DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9zcbo/why_the_market_is_becoming_the_economy_a_tale_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) from Tuesday saying not to go near SPY without a stimulus
-[heres my tweet](https://twitter.com/yourboymilt/status/1336366986545098752?s=21) from last week calling the top of SPY at 370
To be fair, I'm wrong a fucking ton, as we all are lol. but gotta flx those few sweet moments you get it right.

**Positions:**
TLT is my new hedge against SPY because VIX and its derivatives are ass rn. I dont buy puts cuz im not sweet like that.  (here's my[ DD on VIX 101 if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jfhdta/volatility_for_dummies_vxx_uvxy_vxx_and_spy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf))
Other than that, monthly stimulus plays that favor consumer spending (on places that are at an advantage from hybrid online/retail models due to lockdown), TOL (housing numbers explode when stimmy passes), and TDOC because TDOC is dope. 

**WMT: 1/8 155c**
**TGT: 1/8 180c**
**TDOC 11/24 200c**
**TDOC 1/15 205c**
**AAPL: 1/8 126c**
**HPQ: 1/15 25c**
**TOL 1/15 46c**


**TLDR**: FED tools are drying up, SPY is toodangerous for now--market isn't strong enough on its own yet.  Count on monthlies that are a hybrid of pandemic retail/online winnersin preparation for the stimulus, and pay attention the results of FOMC meeting on the 16th.  VXX sucks and I'm using TLT as a hedge.

**TLDR of the TLDR**: PLTR 1/15 500c, GME 12/24 35c

ill try to update contextual news and moves here at the end of the day if alot of people read this, and moves on my twitter yourboymilt since theres no notification thing here (not my fault mods)

Title: $ABCL opened up 200% - Is it a falling knife or a ticket to moon? 
With all the IPO craze weve been seeing right now, its kinda hard to recommend anyone buying into them.( still kinda chocked to see that this opened at 250%.) In fact, ive been recommending more people to move into SPAC plays instead because of the limited downside and room for price discovery especially for the retail investors like us. Investing in a good spac near nav is literally a no brainer and free tendies. That being said, since I have already done the research and a write up for Abcellera, might as well share it with everyone. Please keep in mind that im not recommending people buying into nor do I have a position in this stock. To be quite frankly, no way in hell should this company be trading at such level yet, at least not in another few years to come. But here you go:

We are talking about a company **backed by Bill Gates and has Peter Thiel as the board of director to bring the table experience in scaling technology companies (Daddy Thiel actually owns a stake of the company)**. Abcellera is a company **that helped Lily with the development of the antibody cocktail for COVID at a record-breaking speed** and is entitled to receive percentage of the proceeds that Lily receives from the sales. Currently US government has secured 300,000 does with the option to secure 70,000 more and Canada has secured 26,000 doses with more to come. **Abcellera has been cash flow positive every year since inception and has shown an annual revenue growth rate of 100% over the past 5 years and is here to print yall motherfuckers some real serious tendies.**

About Abcellera

Abcellera is a technology company that searches, decodes, and analyzes natural immune systems to find antibodies that can be developed to prevent and treat disease through artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced technology platform. **Traditional biotech industries usually take too long, cost too much and fails way too often. Drugs discovery usually takes 5 to 15 years with less than 5% success rate and cost billions of dollars to find approved molecules. Abcellera provides the teams and technologies that work broadly with the biotech industries to put the best science and best innovator in touch with the best technology to get faster drugs to patients.** Abcellera essentially **solves the two fundamental problems that hinder the discovery and the development of next generation antibody- based therapeutics. The first is the technology: because of the limitations of legacy discovery approaches, there are many well validated targets for which suitable antibodies cannot be found. The second is access: most companies are forced to cobble together fragmented solutions and lack the facilities and expertise needed to prosecute their antibody programs. Both problems contribute to the rising cost of drug development and delay brining needed therapies to patients.** With the leverage of Abcelleras technology, Eli Lily was able to put out COVID-19 antibody cocktail to trials within a record-breaking speed of just 3 months. Abcellera was able screen through 5.5mil + immune cells to see which makes antibodies on Day 4, find 2K+ potential antibodies that could stick to the virus surface on Day 6, sequence through DNA of 500+ antibodies that could stick to virus spike protein on Day 9, select 190 most promising antibodies for potency testing on Day 17, and finally select 24 antibody front runners for Eli Lily to further develop them into antibody cocktail. Within the past 3 years, **Abcellera has already accrued more than 40 deals, engaged in 94 discovery programs, and under contracted with 26 partners.** **With validation from the partnerships with major biotech firms, it signifies the effectiveness and the reliability of the platform setting Abcellera up for a more lucrative terms and deals in the future.** Through the partnership agreements, Abcellera **will collect near-term payment for technology access, research and intellectual property right, and downstream payments in form of clinical and commercial milestones and royalties on net sales. (Three parts income source model)**



How big is antibody therapy?

Antibody therapy has already been one of the biggest discoveries and is not a thing of the future rather the thing of the present. In 2019\*\*, 7 out of 10 of the best-selling drugs were monoclonal antibodies.\*\* **The global therapeutic monoclonal antibody market has been valued at 150bil by the end of 2019 and 300bil by 2025** with many drugs already approved for treating cancers, autoimmune, metabolic and infectious diseases.

Competitive landscape

Although there are a few of companies developing antibody therapy drugs, they are not the direct competitors of Abcellera. **The purpose of Abcellera is to provide the technology for the biotech companies especially the small to medium firms the ability to compete on the same playing field as the big boys or act as a more cost-effective way of developing new drugs.** (Think of it as the biotech version of TSMC where it provides AMD the ability to compete or over taking Intel, or acts as a more cost-effective ways for chip designers like Apple and Qualcomm to push out chips.) **Over 90% of the antibody market is dominated by 8 companies and Abcellera is here to shake the ground.**

Notable highlights and future plans for the past months:

\- Named on the fierce biotechs fierce 15 list company of 2020

\- Partnership with Invetx to develop new antibody therapies to improve the quality of life of animals and to bring next generation veterinary therapeutics to the market

\- Partnership with Kodiak science to develop eye disease antibodies

\- Partnership with IGM biosciences

\- Acquisition of Ttianni ( a company for developing humanized mice that is designed to maximize immune responses, increase antibody diversity, and preserve natural mutation of fully human antibodies in rodents)

\- Acquisition of OrthMab (a clinically validated platform that uses the most advanced computational and experimental protein engineering methods to create bispecific antibodies from any two antibody sequences.)

* If you check the SEC filing, they offered 77.6M shares at $28 during their IPO, and then later a secondary offering of 17.3M shares at $42. However, **272M** shares will be unlocked next Monday, 12/14, which means any employees, insiders, early institutional investors, or big bois who got in well below $28 can choose to take profits if they want. Current price is hovering between $45 and $46, so make your own decisions. There will be 2.86x shares released than the tradeable public float right now, but of course this is subject to Rule 144 so there are limits on the pure amount that can be dumped at once. 
* Whoever pumped the option volume from single digits to over 1.2K got in around 0.35 - 0.50 for their premiums. Just a frame of reference if you wanted to get some confidence on overall pricing. Current premium for the same $40 PUT option right now is around 0.45, but bid-ask spread is high again.
* Safest play: If the stock bounces or rallies again today by the EOD, just follow whoever this whale option buyer is and try to pick up $40 PUTS for cheaper, maybe around 0.25 or 0.30. Note this is unlikely and you probably won't get filled in time, but most likely you will only lose 1 day of theta maximum and can selloff right away on Monday if insiders choose not to sell their shares.
* Riskier play: If you are more risk tolerant or like gambling, aka everyone on this sub, then just follow the WHALE and buy hundreds of the $40 PUT option. You will risk illiquidity to close and theta for 1 day though if the stock does not drop much.

&amp;#x200B;

**Positions:** I'm poor as fuck and not employed yet so only **short 25 shares at $46.20**, and holding **4 Dec 18 $45 PUT options** (Sadly, this is decent chunk of my portfolio value). Also trying to get filled for 20 $40 PUTS, but probably won't happen in time before close to see if bid-ask spread lowers and premiums drop for a last minute bounce.

Please read my investment thesis for Psychedelic Pharma Industry &amp; Mind Medicine Inc. 

I've made my own argument and linked to over a dozen sources that contain facts and data that support it.

Please do your own DD before buying!!

Title: Why I'm Shorting the Tits off SPCE
 1. As of writing, SPCE has a market cap of 7.8 billion dollars and 600 people have signed up, which comes out to $13,000,000/person while tickets are $250k/person. I may wear a helmet to sleep and ride the short bus to a puzzle factory every day but that math is too retarded even for me.

2. Blue origin will (eventually) fly you to space for $150k in a real rocket, not some weird looking airplane like SPCE that costs $100k more. If Im going to go to space Id rather get the complete experience and do it in Bezoss giant overcompensating rocket cock (just google image it). If I want to be weightless then I can pay for a flight in a private vomit comet for $5k.

3. When the eviction mortarium ends and the shit really hits the fan, our streets are flooded with the newly homeless and every year brings a record forest fire season, even the most out of touch millionaires may think it is in poor taste to spend $250k and burn a shitload of fossil fuels for a 3-hour flight and maybe 5 minutes of weightlessness.

4. I grew up in New Mexico and Virgins spaceport is in an armpit in the middle of nowhere. The whole lead-up to the launch is going to be depressing, probably involving a \~3-hour long drive from the Albuquerque airport along a desolate stretch of interstate. Maybe theyll set up a helicopter or commuter plane type service for VIPs but still they will have nothing else to do there. I think Virgin is the only occupant of the spaceport and the rest of the facility is deserted. No nice restaurants, no clubs, just dusty wasteland. Not cool.

5. Maybe a few people will still go through the hassle and expense of a SPCE flight (If they ever happen) but once word of mouth spreads and Forbes pays to send up a journalist to write up the whole experience then the excitement will be over. They will need thousands of customers a year to make this whole endeavor make sense and I just dont see that ever happening.

6. Although I sincerely hope that this doesnt happen, they already had one fatal crash in 2014. Not that I am in any way counting on it, but space flight is risky and rich-ass space tourists only want to **pretend** to do something dangerous. Even a whiff of another safety issue will tank the stock. 

7. SPCE has been messing around since 2004 and still has essentially no revenue but they lose more $$ every year.  Actually, this is kind of bullish?

8. Out of the aerospace people I have talked to (granted, only 3 of them; 2 BA and 1 Blue Origin) it seems like the cool kids work for either SpaceX or NASA. Most of them forget that Virgin Galactic is even a thing until you bring it up to them.

9. Even if the SPCE test goes well today I think it will be bad for them. They will see a funny looking airplane thing and then compare it to the gangster-ass shit that the other private space companies are doing and it wont be a good look.

10. If youre rich and boring and really need to make yourself appear interesting at dinner parties that badly then you can fly Blue Origin, buy a Lambo Urus or Huracan and have money left over. If you just want a memorable experience then you could get a $10K a day hooker for weeks and have the champagne and cocaine blowout of a lifetime.

Title: Analysis: Corporate Misconduct and Fines
*Disclaimer: This post is longer than a tweet. I'd encourage you to read the summary and skim the bold text and pretty pictures if you don't want to read the whole thing. I'd encourage you to not be the kid who beats the dead horse commenting "didn't read" if you're too illiterate to read at all.* 

# Summary

Looking at a small sample of corporate fines from the last two years, I found that there is no single rule for how stock prices will react to fine announcements, in the short-term or the long-term, when looking at violations as a whole.

**However**, there appear to be strong trends among fines within certain categories. The most clear pattern is consistent long-term underperformance among companies fined under the False Claims Act.

You can stay on top of this data with a dashboard that I've been working on that tracks of announcements of fines and violations. Mods willing, I'll edit in a link. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Background

Every year, U.S. government agencies impose billions of dollars in fines on publicly-traded companies to penalize corporate wrongdoing. The graph below shows companies that have received fines over the last two years (sized based on market cap, and colored based on the severity of their total fines).

https://preview.redd.it/lq3b8g847l461.png?width=1119&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3b767c7196833c359cc1f21ccedba6ea6ad202b

These fine announcements can be a shock event, and often cause an immediate market sell-off. However, [recent research](https://hs-7275785.t.hubspotstarter-hn.net/e2t/tc/VWPkMH9856YhW90LFCz47ZWKXW1-ywb14k7NsgN3fD2BZ5kbT5V3Zsc37CgK_-W4Jzm-x330HypW2w5xQ28R01NxN1HwxPf2C3q2W2HgSqG4yCyFZW5C8hFv3D7ts5W46NPhn5dpM75W3sxNMS2D-Fq_W5mm9P611dp30W7Rqccf2ZKxXtW3--TJ58MlQgVW7WlYk15Qp7RMW8ZTNFD63W04bW6rstvY7_mSCJW4mm2bS6_vXJNV-S5Kk28F_gjW4HzBg61qB41rW31ytDJ3b3WX-W1gLd0q24zLGcN5rnhY0MgQ9_W5LlV8x7LwJPvW7CdhHw5ttd_8W78DVJF2mCs8lW1yWhjL9dfDwNMC42P2bkvzlVZg4Cz2K6rmpV42NpR8KL0P9Vc4H1k7kg2KQW8t9cwX7jzx7zW6x8PPm192SmsW1w4dsc5wmXLPW7Fj0Cj8Wy7zQW7SW5n68sDBsq34GW1) has shown that this initial shock is typically an overreaction, and that companies receiving fines are likely to outperform the market in the following months.

That isn't always true. While corporate fines are oftenone-time penalties that amount to little more than a "dividend check lost in the mail", they are occasionally symptoms of deep underlying problems that will plague or even doom a business.

To better understand how to discriminate between these two possibilities, I analyzed some of the largest corporate fines from the last two years and the short- and long-term market reaction surrounding their announcement.

We looked at fines that fell into five different categories: privacy violations, False Claims Act violations, Controlled Substance Act violations, environmental violations, and consumer protection violations. Within each of these categories, I charted abnormal returns (a company's stock return minus the market's return) surrounding fine announcements to see if there were clear patterns in price movement.

# False Claims Act Violations

***More than any other type of misconduct, False ClaimsAct violations seem to be associated with systematic problems with a company's business model. Fine announcements in this category have often been followed by several months of consistent underperformance.***

https://preview.redd.it/gr4e2pc67l461.png?width=1336&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79896f6b1b576bffd4b8e945644b1ee835e25557

**Novartis(NVS) - $678 Million**

On July 1, 2020, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation agreed to pay a $678 million fine to resolve a case in which the drug-maker was accused of paying kickbacks to thousands of doctors to entice them to prescribe its medicines. In the week after the fine was announced, NVS stock fell by only 1%. However, in the following months it has risen by only 2%, far underperforming the market.

**Walgreens Boots Alliance(WBA) - $269 Million**

On January 22, 2019, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. agreed to pay $269 million to settle two lawsuits accusing it of civil fraud for overbilling federal healthcare programs over a decade.

# Privacy Violations

***While there have been several large fines in this category, they typically don't represent a threat to the company's underlying business model. Facebook, Equifax, and Google all outperformed the market after being fined for privacy violations, partially due to tailwinds in Big Tech/Data valuations over the last two years.***

https://preview.redd.it/1i14klzb7l461.png?width=1092&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=085930ee2e07b21a5bc92fbbc1e3776b7e43d7b1

Title: The Fallen Berry will be reincarnated as a $BB Rocket going to the moon!  
Hello Retard!! 

Have you heard of the fallen Berry in the Fruit wars of the touch phones? 

NO?? Good I didn't expect you to know anything you retarded fuck!! and don't research it too or I'll call your wife's boyfriend to beat your ass!

Any way... Black Berry has reinvented it self as an IT company in 2014 after John Chen became CEO. It now leads in the cybersecurity industry with contracts signed with 19 out of the 20 G20 countries. From the Airforce to Fortune 500 companies Blackberry handles their cybersecurity needs.

I can go on and on about how good they are in the cybersecurity space but WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT SHIT! What we care about is the EV(EV stands for electrical vehicle you retard) industry which **WE** Blasted into Saturn this year.

The Black Berry QNX software is in 175 million vehicles. In addition, BlackBerry just announced that it partnered with **Amazon** to create Black Berry IVY which is a software which will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights  from that data that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles. **Blah Blah Blah,** why would I care? Because every car company and especially EV companies were looking for a service like this which Black Berry and Amazon **will literally pioneer.** In addition, the CEO mentioned in an interview the possibility of partnering up with our EV company **$TSLA.** Now imagine how news of this would affect $BB.

&amp;#x200B;

Now your small brain might wonder with all of Black Berry's potential, why isn't it moving much in price???!!! 

In my opinion, It's because boomers are still butt hurt about the steep price drop of it after the fruit wars and that it never recovered. This company literally has a price to book value of 2.3. Which means it's very undervalued!! and it has **CASH** for days... so no worries about offerings.

**Now for the important part how could it rise to what it's actually worth??** 

We retards can adopt this $BB and raise it to be the next bloated(100$+) EV play in the industry. Why raise foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..) when we can literally raise a North American $BB. 

$BB needs more exposure and we can start by making some High quality memes for it...

**TLDR;(I'm all in $BB)**

My positions: 1333 stocks, 100 19 MAR 21 12$ calls

**40 18 Dec 10$ calls:** Earnings are going to be on December 17

Title: [Insider Info]Pfiezer Vaccine to be approved and shipped out on Monday next week

They will start with the initial deployment of the Vaccine on Wednesday 12/16/2020 .

If you need proof : Heres the huge gigantic freezer that is currently in my office space that you saw (probably) on the news last monday :

Title: Message to those who suck Cohen Wenis
Message to Ryan Cohen DickSuckers

To all the Ryan Cohen dicksuckers,

Why not invest in CHWY instead of GME? Despite some recovery this year, GME is a company that has been failing despite CAGR of 12.1% over the course of the past 5 years in gaming. Now you may ask, why the fuck would GameStop fail despite such strong growth in gaming. Ill tell you why. THEY BUTTFUCK THEMSELVES ON REAL ESTATE EXPENSES. On top of that they were a laggard in adopting a robust e-commerce platform, making them lose market share. In a 10 mile radius from my home there is 13 GameStop stores, and Im certain this story is true for many different parts of the US. 

Now you might argue that this is precisely what makes GME attractive. Ryan Cohen is going to come in and shit on the whole board and well be seeing  for days. Unfortunately, this isnt that simple. Even with 10% ownership in GME, its pretty difficult for someone like Cohen to come in and conduct a hostile takeover, and its definitely not quick. Instead, let me make a quick and simple proposal to those of you who love Cohen.

Invest in CHWY. This is the best e-commerce play available in the market in my opinion. We saw a great earnings report last week detailing how CHWY has managed to improve margins, grow its customer base, and launch a new Telehealth platform for pets. Despite all this its only trading at about 6 times sales. LET ME REITERATE THAT IN CAPS FOR THOSE NOT PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION. CHWY IS ONLY TRADING AT ABOUT 6 TIMES SALES. 

You might argue that the most directly comparable company, AMZN, trades at 4.5 times sales. And I would argue that CHWY is growing at a much faster pace. And with introduction of pet telehealth, we should see stronger growth within a seemingly new and disruptive sector that has emerged since the introduction. 

CONCLUSION/TLDR;

If you want to suck Cohens dick, suck it through CHWY, not GME dumbasses.
CHWY 
Chewy moon
Fuck the 
Fuck waiting on GME to turn around
Invest in CHWY

Title: ASO is a diamond
Academy Sports and Outdoors is just what it sounds like, outdoors and sports good. Think Dick's. The IPO was in October and the price is already up 34% from 12-18. 

Why will this stock skyrocket?

Revenue: 5.26B
Market cap: 1.64B

As soon as word spreads about this steal, people will be snatching up ASO like hotcakes.

They absolutely crushed earning with their strong E-commerce platform.

With vaccine announcements happening early next year, outdoors and sports related companies will thrive heading into the summer. 

ASO is under the radar and will pick up steam as soon as the WSB finds out.

Get on this rocketship

Title: Petition to make IIRP a meme stock
Innovative Industrial Companies has gotten surprisingly little attention here despite being, IMO, by far the best weed play on the market. For years I've been watching you retards lose money buying calls in Canadian weed companies. What you didn't take into account is that Canada has a population of approximately 200 people, they can't export product to the states, and even if/when weed is legalized in the States it isn't guaranteed that importing it will be allowed. Even if it is, domestic players will promptly destroy their Canuck competitors. 

If you've followed this stock at all you know that they don't directly sell cannabis. They are a REIT that leases industrial property to state-licensed cannabis operators. Real estate itself isn't where its value lies, though. Federal prohibition had caused cannabis companies to lack access to traditional banking and financing. IIRP's model is essentially a loophole to fill that gap. They buy out properties that have already gone through state licensing processes and lease that property to the operator they bought it from. In buying property from existing, successful growers they effectively finance operation maintenance and expansion. Through their initial purchase they have effectively guaranteed that the grower will have capital enough to pay them rent. Moreover, and I don't give a shit because I'm only buying calls, as a REIT, they are required to issue a big dividend so big brokers and boomers will feel more comfortable increasing. Right now they sport a 2.7% dividend. 

They also conduct business in only 7 states through the medical cannabis market. 34 states have legal cannabis and the company has expressed that they plan to continue to expand. IIRP dominates the industry in pretty much every scenario. If marijuana is legalized they have a huge foothold in the new market. If nothing changes they dominate the medical market. The industry has proven that it thrives in COVID shutdown scenarios. Their model also makes them immune to the fluctuating market of retail cannabis - they collect money regardless of how well the operation they financed is profitable from one quarter to the next.

Oh yeah, and unlike other weed plays, they're profitable. They have a market cap that is about 1/4 that of CGC and P/E of 50, which isn't as retarded as it once was. 

I think this has the formula to be a great meme stock because it's a quality company with a good business model that just needs a little bit of autistic exuberance to give it explosive growth. I currently have January 2022 calls, expecting it to double in the next year.

Title: Royalty Pharma ($RPRX) Lock-up Expiration - FINAL CALL to TENDIE-TOWN
This has been going under the radar, so here's some DD for you , last call for tendie-town

Royalty Pharma ($RPRX) is a biopharmaceutical company which buys smaller ventures/invests and receives licensing/patents/royalties from said ventures. With a slow-but-sure growth through the COVID pandemic, the buy ratings by analysts for the stock hover between weak Buy or Hold.

Now, if any of you s know about IPO lock-up expirations, you will know that traditionally, there have been around 1-5% declines in stock value, and up to ~200% increase in trading volume on the first few days of IPO lock-up expirations.

I'm gonna keep it nice and easy, with pictures, so most of us idiots can digest the info with relative ease.

=== WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR US?? ===

Royalty Pharma has about ~90-95m shares in the public float from IPO(~77m) + Second offering(~17m), out of ~365-388 MILLION shares outstanding. THIS IS NOT INCLUDING THE CLASS B INTERESTS WHICH CAN BE CONVERTED TO CLASS A SHARES (public tradeable shares), of which there are ~240 MILLION ADDITIONAL. All under the same 180-day IPO Lock-up since June.

Proof - page 196 SEC filing - https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-171165/

**TL;DR**

Royalty Pharma ($RPRX) IPO'd in June and lock-up expiration is DECEMBER 14, Monday.

In addition to ~90 million shares, ~280 million (300%+ volume) additional shares are about to hit the market in the coming week.

That is not including the potential of Class B -&gt; Class A share converters, which means there can be an additional ~240 million shares on top of the aforementioned, to enter the market from Monday.

-RPRX IPO'd at $28 and has been rocking between ~$40-62 USD consistently since then. For insiders who bought the stock pre-IPO for $20 or less, they have made over 100% gains since June. With a metric ton potential of ~300m+ shares diluting the market, is this stock going to go UP or DOWN? Your turn.

Title: Airbnb Valuation - Growth is expensive in this market
&amp;#x200B;

* AirBnb has more than [4 million hosts](https://news.airbnb.com/thankyou/)  offering private rooms in their own homes to luxury experiences, from    one night to several weeks or months. AirBnb has a presence in more  than 220 countries and regions and has served over 825 million guest  arrivals and has cumulatively earned $110bn in revenue.
* AirBnb intends to [disrupt](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/02/airbnb-hotels-disruption/553556/) the one-size-fits-all approach that was the standard for travel and    leisure. The company believes that hosting is at the center of the AirBnb experience and this focus enables guests to access unique places and experiences that were previously inaccessible.
* In   2019, the  company generated Gross Booking Value of $38bn, 29%  growth  y/y,  and has generated $507mm in free cash flow since inception, signifying its clear potential to cash generation in the near future.  Gross Bookings Value were down 39% y/y in the first 9 months of 2020 due  to the Covid pandemic per the  [company S-1.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm)
* The company business model has shown resilience in the face of the   pandemic  with business beginning to pick up within two months of travel   shutting  down around the world per the company S-1. Domestic travel   has been especially strong and has rebounded at a rapid pace with   people choosing  to travel closer to home.
* The   stock is priced incredibly high,  and while we love the company and  what its doing, the valuation is  simply not enticing as an investor. The stock is trading near our absolute Bull Case scenario which we   outline in our valuation.

**Business Model:**

The  concept of AirBnb was born in  2007 when the two founders, Brian  and  Joe, noticed an international  conference was coming to town and  every  hotel was sold out. The  founders quickly created a website,   AirBedandBreakfast.com, and were  able to rent their apartment to the   conference attendees.

Airbnb is the latest company to make use of the [sharing economy,](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharing-economy.asp) or the peer-to-peer economy. The business model is built on buyers  and   sellers sharing resources through collaborative consumption of  goods,   services, and of ownership. The Airbnb platform [provides tools](https://www.airbnb.com/host/homes) that make it easy to connect hosts who own houses and apartments with    guests who seek to rent them for short-term stays. Airbnbs revenues comes from fees collected on guest rental stays with fees being  charged   on both the host and the guest side per the [company S-1](https://www.airbnb.com/host/homes). In 2016, Airbnb added another business line with [experiences](https://www.airbnb.com/s/experiences), but the business has been slow to gain any meaningful traction with only [$10 million in sales in 2017](http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/).

This is a handy graphic summarizing the business model courtesy of [Aswath Damodaran](http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/).

And Airbnb provides an illustrative example of the business model at work with the fees they would collect in their [S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm).

**Hosts:**

As of September 30, 2020, AirBnb had [4 million hosts](https://news.airbnb.com/thankyou/)  around the world, with 86% of hosts outside the United States, and 7.4    million available listings of homes and experiences, 5.6 million of   which were active listings per the [company S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm).   Per the company, We consider a listing of a home or an experience  tobe an active listing if it is viewable on Airbnb and has been   previously booked at least once on Airbnb.

Hosts generally fall into two categories  individual and [professional.](https://www.airbnb.com/d/host_pro) Individual hosts activate their listings directly on the Airbnb    platform through the website or app. Professional hosts in contrast run    their own property management or hospitality business and use programs    to list their properties on the Airbnb platform. As of December 31,  2019, 90% of hosts were individual hosts and 72% of nights booked were    with individual hosts per the [company S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm). Individual hosts are the core component and key supply for Airbnb.

Airbnb provides a number of services to enable their 4 million hosts. Anyone [can become a successful host](https://www.airbnb.com/host/homes?af=43720035&amp;c=.pi0.pk37076538223_185707635826_c_141022032497&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAq8f-BRBtEiwAGr3DgW9my6otYP6hT1Yr5gQAFtISRM1zMA7k0KbUXYnB7wIFE1cdiLkoHhoCoK8QAvD_BwE) on the Airbnb platform and Airbnb is able to provide a number of services per the [S-1](https://www.airbnb.com/host/homes?af=43720035&amp;c=.pi0.pk37076538223_185707635826_c_141022032497&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAq8f-BRBtEiwAGr3DgW9my6otYP6hT1Yr5gQAFtISRM1zMA7k0KbUXYnB7wIFE1cdiLkoHhoCoK8QAvD_BwE) including:

* Global demand: Anyone with an internet connection can book an Airbnb experience from anywhere in the world
* Merchandising: Airbnb helps hosts create and activate their listings on the  platform. By taking hosts step-by-step through the process, Airbnb is  able to  make  posting effective and easy.
* Pricing:  Hosts can set their own  prices, but Airbnb does provide smart pricing  tools that suggest prices  based on changes in demand for other similar listings based on factors like the season and expected demand.
* Scheduling:   Hosts can  easily manage their calendars and accept and manage their  listings and  reservations on the platform through the website or app.
* Payments:  Airbnb facilitates all payments by collecting payments from guests and    processing the payments to hosts. In 2019, Airbnb processed  approximately $70bn of guest and host transactions.

Airbnb also provides services like community support, host protections, posted reviews and feedback, and a superhost program.

**Key metrics and Covid resilience:**

According to the company [S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm), the majority of guests who have ever made a booking on Airbnb were  between the ages of 18-34. In 2019, 54 million active bookers worldwide  booked 327 million nights and experiences on the platform.

https://preview.redd.it/qd5s6uwbak461.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f31f59757384127b60bcee981d39fe6f51b4ce2

Nights and experiences booked are a key measure of the true scale of  the Airbnb platform. Per the company S-1, Nights and Experiences Booked  on our platform in a period represents the sum of the total number of  nights booked for stays and  the total number of seats booked for  experiences, net of cancellations and alterations that occurred in that  period.

In   2019, Airbnb had 326.9 mm Nights and Experiences booked, a 31% increase from the 250.3 mm in 2018, which grew 35% from 2017. Typically,    the first, second, and third quarters of the year each have higher Nights and Experiences Booked compared to the fourth quarter, as guests  travel during the peak travel season, which is in the third quarter  for   North America and EMEA according to the company S-1.

Covid has obviously [had an effect](https://www.ahla.com/covid-19s-impact-hotel-industry) on the hotel industry, and Airbnb is not immune with 2020 being a down    year and Q2 being particularly severe across several key metrics. However, the business model has shown resilience and management attributes this to the renewed ability and willingness of guests to travel. I know personally Im looking at Airbnbs in warmer climates as Im itching to get out of the cold and soon to be lock downed  northeast US.

https://preview.redd.it/cjgmuu5gak461.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dc335ba9eb14e5cf2a93d394d12362943848213

For the nine months ended Sept 30,   2020, the company had 146.9 mm  Nights and Experiences Booked, a   decrease of 41% compared to the prior year period according to the [company S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm).    However, the decline was most severe in the second quarter and   business  has rebounded with Q3 being down only 28% y/y. The company   credits this  improvements primarily to stronger results in North   America and Europe  and in particular to resilience in domestic and   short-distance travel.

Gross   Bookings value is defined in the S-1 as the dollar  value of  bookings  on our platform in a period and is inclusive of host  earnings,  service  fees, cleaning fees, and taxes, net of cancellations  and  alterations  that occurred during that period. Growth in Gross Bookings Value  reflects the companys ability to attract and retain hosts and guests   and  reflects growth in Nights and Experiences booked. In 2019, Gross  Bookings Value grew 29%  y/y and 2018 grew 40% y/y.

https://preview.redd.it/zgld3exgak461.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8898a508d1ffdec0acc59d243e23ea945538c74

In 2020, there is a similar drop in  Gross Bookings due to the Covid pandemic.  For the first nine months  ended Sept 30 2020 Gross Bookings was $18bn, a 39%  decrease from the  prior year period  according to the S-1. The decline  was once again  most severe in Q2 and  Q3 rebounded, being down only 17%  y/y.

In   2019, Gross Bookings and revenue by region were about equal between  Europe, Middle East, and Africa and  for  North America. However, as a  result of the pandemic, Gross Bookings and revenue have reflected a  shift toward North America where the recovery has been strongest.   For  the first nine months of 2020, Gross Bookings Value was $9.7 billion,  or 54% of the total, in North America compared to $5.6billion, or 31%,  in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, $1.6billion, or 9%, in Asia  Pacific, and $1.1billion, or 6%, in Latin   America  company S-1

https://preview.redd.it/l8vwl6klak461.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c47266ada3851c20e505b022c3054c850715bea5

Historically, Airbnb has had a strong weight toward cross-border travel,  with 49% of nights in 2019 compared to managements estimate of 20% of total overnight paid trips for the travel industry as a whole according  the company S-1. However, the pandemic has marked a shift to  domestic travel in Airbnbs traditional travel corridor mix. In   September 2020, 77% of experiences booked were domestic compared to 52%  in January. In  fact, domestic bookings have grown at a rapid clip with   54% growth in  June 2020 and 35% growth in September 2020. 

https://preview.redd.it/zap4dhgnak461.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=147ce7e7e1b224cbcbaf8e2eeb54a78c1dd7e1b9

Clearly, Airbnb is well-positioned because of its wide offering to cater   shifting consumer travel habits and this has enabled the company to be  more resilient in a downturn than travel competitors, in some metrics even being able to achieve grow. If we look at hotel and travel booking competitors, we see that Airbnb has weathered the pandemic much  better   than most peers when looking at 9 months ended Sept 30 2020 revenue. Airbnb revenue is down -31.9% so far in 2020 compared to the  median hotel revenue being down -48.2% and travel bookings being down  -53.3%.  Airbnb has also bounced back faster than every competitor minus  [CHH](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1046311/000104631120000041/chh-10q09302020.htm) in Q3 with revenues down -18.4% compared to the 50.9% median for hotels and -52.7% for travel bookings companies. 

https://preview.redd.it/q0lc324qak461.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ba72173c69f93b6a926d36b67d15fdc46e8beb2

**TAM and growth strategy:**

Management highlights massive market opportunities in its [S-1 filing,](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm)  We have a substantial market opportunity in the growing travel market    and experience economy. We estimate our serviceable addressable market    (SAM) today to be $1.5 trillion, including $1.2 trillion for   short-term stays and $239 billion for experiences. We estimate our total addressable market (TAM) to be $3.4 trillion, including $1.8   trillion  for short-term stays, $210 billion for long-term stays, and   $1.4 trillion for experiences.**

In   general, these assumptions are based on the belief that new travel   behaviors will expand the market opportunity over time as well as the need to justify a large market cap. Management uses their own internal    estimates to come up with the $1.2trn for short-term stays and [Euromonitor](https://www.euromonitor.com/usa)estimates of tourist spend on attractions and experiences to estimate  the $239mm for Experiences. To get the TAM short-term stays estimate, management assumes an increase in trips per capita based on The World    Travel and Tourism Council [estimated 3.5% CAGR](https://wttc.org/Research/Economic-Impact).   For long-term stays, the company uses 10% of the $1.6trn global residential rental market. And for experiences, they add $1.1trn of   non-tourist recreational spend, again as estimated by [Euromonitor](https://www.euromonitor.com/usa).

https://preview.redd.it/jrckxy31bk461.png?width=548&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c9e4ea99993a2e8f07644dbfed790ac2b7d722b

 In its early stages when it was a [startup pitching to VCs back in 2009.](https://millennialmkts.com/Users/danie/AppData/Local/Temp/startup%20pitching%20to%20VCs%20back%20in%202009) Airbnb estimated the TAM to be 2 billion+ trips a year and its SAM to be 560mn trips a year. 

https://preview.redd.it/o3cwgw32bk461.png?width=521&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6814c943d70ac8e5951c247875995e27c3e39d2f

 Another way to look at Airbnbs TAM is to look at the hotel business globally. According to NYU professor [Aswath Damodarans Airbnb analysis](http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/).    The industry generated over $600bn in revenues in 2019, but its  growth   has stalled and the industry remains concentrated among the top  5  hotel  chains. The US is the leading geographical market, but Asia  has  been gaining ground. 

https://preview.redd.it/ave4p504bk461.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8428d25c1841c71eb27dafe2469238ea6f608238

The truth is Airbnbs TAM, and we   agree with Damodarans analysis  here, is probably somewhere in between  these two numbers. Ignoring  Airbnbs experiences portion of the TAMcalculation because that  business line is nascent at best, we get a upper estimate of $2trn and a  lower estimate of $600bn for Airbnbs   TAM.

**Peers:** 

We   identify comparable peers to get a sense of Airbnbs valuation and   how  in-line it is with the industry, while also keeping in mind Airbnb   is  growing faster and attempting to disrupt the hotel and travel  booking   industries. Current Hotel comparable peers are trading at a median of 4.1x 2021 sales and 2.0x 2022 sales according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/solution/bloomberg-terminal/)  Analyst Consensus estimates, while Airbnbs IPO price implies  18.45x  and 15.33x Sales based on our own estimates of 2021 and 2022 sales,    respecivetly. The EBITDA comparison is tough to make with Airbnb because    we estimate they will be EBITDA negative in 2021, and the EBITDA in    2022 and 2023 will be $130mm and $370mm leading to high multipliers. We    can see that the median hotel company is trading at 22.3x 2021   estimated  EBITDA and 13.9x 2022 estimated EBITDA according to Bloomberg    consensus.

However, perhaps a   more apt comparison is looking at online travel  booking peers such as   Expedia (EXPE) and Booking.com (BKNG). The EV /  Sales and EV / EBITDA are slightly higher for this comparable group vs  the pure hotels peers,   primarily due to Booking.com. The median among  this group trade at   4.5x 2021 sales and 3.4x 2022 sales according to  Bloomberg consensus.

https://preview.redd.it/40h2lhl9bk461.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f32a8d313aa93cee47b38d78f6ed105578f86ef

 

Is the Airbnb premium justified? One   can argue a more resilient  business model, the promise of fast growth, and large market opportunities created by disruption and innovation may make the premium  seem reasonable when we try to compare the  company to  peer groups. There  truly is only one Airbnb and these peer  groups arent entirely  indicative of the future company profile of  Airbnb.

**Valuation:**

Setting the stage for the valuation, we take a look at Airbnbs [Venture Capital pricing in](https://craft.co/airbnb/funding-rounds) the rounds leading up to the IPO. We can see that the company has    raised $5.8bn in VC funding and its latest Series F round in 2016. In  April 2020 the company was valued [at $18bn](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airbnb-debt/airbnbs-new-1-billion-investment-comes-at-lower-valuation-sources-idUSKBN21P3IM).

https://preview.redd.it/zgc3eyeabk461.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=298b0e974f95c2b74ec900ff1d9e6856b0c6fdfb

The IPO has clearly priced in a lot   of generous assumptions as well  as simple speculation with a hot   market. Initially, Airbnb planned to  sell shares for a range of [$44-$50 per share](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520306257/d81668ds1a.htm) in a filing made December 1. Then on December 7, they announced plans to sell shares for a range of [$56  $60.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520311265/d81668ds1a.htm) The company then priced their IPO at [$68 a share](https://www.wsj.com/articles/airbnb-expected-to-price-ipo-above-56-to-60-a-share-range-11607527468) on Wednesday, December 9. Shares opened trading at around $150 and ended the day at $144.71.

Heres some [institutional investor background](https://themarketear.com/posts/coBkK-wxO2)   on how this IPO is being looked at, "Sanford  Bernstein ran a  Procensus investor survey to compile major talking  points. \~100   investors participated. Consensus  suggests Airbnb delivers a +16%  revenue CAGR in the next  decade with  steady state margins at \~25%.  Bulls will argue the IPO price  range (now indicating near \~$60) is reasonable

\+16%  Revenue CAGR  seems somewhat reasonable to us, so the biggest assumption in question  really is the \~25% margins in our view. With that being said, and trying  to remain reasonable from an assumptions stand   point, here are our  main assumptions:

* In  2020 Airbnb Bookings will be down \~34%, but Airbnb will have a  bounce   back year in 2021, with high Bookings growth in 2022-2025, and   Bookings  growth slowing in 2026-2030. Our Base case in Bookings growth   is shown  below.

https://preview.redd.it/9pqh0wigbk461.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41f519e04eed800de49de37bd391f170f8207f81

* Revenues   as a % of Bookings will continue to increase  in the future as the new   host model for professional hosts and  Experiences business gain steam   and a larger % of Airbnb Bookings.  Revenue as a % of Bookings was [12.6% in 2019](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm) and we estimate it will be around 14.6% in 2025 for example.
* Operating    costs will continue to decrease as a % of revenue as Airbnb continues    to grow in scale. This continuing growth in scale culminates in a  high   single digit operating margin by 2025 and a 27.1% operating  margin by   2030. This is lower than Bookings (BKNG) operating margin  of [35.5% in 2019](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1075531/000107553120000011/bkng1231201910k.htm), but higher than hotel operators such as [Marriotts](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1524358/000152435820000011/a2019q410-kdocument.htm) (VAC) or 17.4% [Hyatt](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468174/000146817420000015/0001468174-20-000015-index.htm) (H), 9.1% respectively in 2019.

https://preview.redd.it/u0vwzf4ibk461.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ab6c603129841215f6cde4c026ece0fff823325

Taking a look into future revenue growth scenarios with revenues  increasing as a % of Bookings and Bookings growth, we get a range of potential 2025 revenues. We think anywhere from $11bn to $13.7bn in revenue is the likeliest scenario for Airbnb in 2025. 

https://preview.redd.it/rqq5brtjbk461.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=131a5ef3c87d7a9556fdb5c8c2822e4626e7e8f5

Using a discounted cash flow model with a [Weighted Average Cost of Capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp) of 8% and a [perpetual growth rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/perpetuity.asp) of 3%, we get a Base Case price of $77.40.

Whats interesting in our valuation is that the vast majority of value in Airbnb is from the [Net Present Value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp) of the [terminal value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/terminalvalue.asp). Because Terminal Value is based on the companys value in perpetuity    beyond our 10-year cash flow forecast, assumptions have an incredibly large effect on the current valuation. Any sort of valuation can be justified based on any set of input growth assumptions. We try to stay  reasonable while acknowledging the upside that Airbnb does really exhibit. We show a range of cases below:

 **Upside and Downside Risks:**

Upside risks include higher than anticipated Bookings leading to  higher   revenue estimates. It is certainly possible we (and the market)  are  underestimated top line growth potential as Airbnb continues to  expand   domestically and abroad.

Another upside risk is profitability. Airbnb in theory should be able  to scale effectively given its business model and that the company  itself does not own or hold the properties. They provide a platform and  services, not the physical product, so as they become larger more  efficiencies   should be achieved and redundancies should be eliminated.

The main downside risks are two: valuation and regulatory issues. We  love   this company, but the valuation is simply incredibly rich and  already  at our Bull Case. A good company does not equal a good  investment if  the price is not good. However, we are not calling for  shorting this   because the market is red hot and can continue to be for  months or even   years. We are simply stating that odds are [not in your favor](https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2019/02/19/howard-marks-cfa-getting-the-odds-on-your-side/) here at this price level.

Another meaningful risk is regulatory scrutiny. Airbnb [lists what regulations apply](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/961/what-regulations-apply-to-my-city) may to a hosts city and there has been pushback in certain [cities](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/nyregion/airbnb-jersey-city-election-results.html) and [communities](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/new-effort-underway-to-regulate-short-term-home-rentals-in-st-louis/article_370e0012-0338-574d-8f17-38afd097f93c.html) against short-term rentals through platforms like Airbnb. Here is a list of certain [short-term rental laws](https://www.2ndaddress.com/research/short-term-rental-laws/) across the US.

**TLDR;** Great company, not so great valuation. If you like Airbnb, you'll love  BKNG. It's priced for perfection, but market is hot and it can stay  hot  for months or years so time will tell if/when it'll come down.

Title: SUMO is a sleeper stock and remains grossly undervalued
Sumo Logic (SUMO) is a cloud-based data analytics company competing against Splunk and Datadog. 


*This is a sleeper stock that IPO'd on September 17, which was the day after Snowflake's IPO. 

* They beat earnings on Dec 7th by 28% YOY and have very good upside potential. 

* It's very undervalued when compared to competitors with a current market cap of ~$2.75B, a TTM revenue of $192M, and a current share price of about $26-27. 

* Current analyst price targets are a median of $29.50 and a high of $34. I think it could EASILY hit $100 within 12 months time (reason below).



Is this company better than Datadog? No, BUT it's hugely undervalued in comparison:

DDOG revenue TTM: $539.58M 
DDOG market cap: $30.92B
DDOG P/S ratio = $30.92B/$539.58M = ~57.3

SUMO revenue TTM: $192M
SUMO market cap: $2.75B
SUMO P/S ratio = $2.75B/$192M = ~14.3

(Source: Yahoo Finance on Dec 11, 2020)


DDOG's p/s ratio 400% higher than SUMO's! With 102M shares outstanding, SUMO can hit $100 with a modest market cap of $10B. Once this stock gets proper attention, I believe it will steadily climb to its true valuation.

Title: GME: Bull case vs bear case, from both perspective
This is a post I wrote before earnings. 
 m's banned me for a DD that was short but actually made money to who followed it. 

But this post, it still isnt useless now. Have a read you all.

Seeing that a significant interest has developed around the fabled GME short squeeze, I have written this post and I hope this writing provides an overview of the situation.

# The case for a squeeze:

The entire argument for a short squeeze hinges on the possibility that either the management agrees with Ryan Cohen's [plan](https://archive.is/qUm5s) and addresses it or he decides to pursue a hostile takeover.

**In this spirit, we urge you to quickly provide stockholders with a credible and publicly-available roadmap for cost containment, prioritizing profitable retail locations and geographic markets, and building the e-commerce ecosystem gamers deserve.** (from the letter)

This is Ryan Cohen's plan in its most raw form. Or to put it more simply, he wants GameStop to become the ultimate destination for gamers by leveraging its 55 million PowerUp members, its brand power; reducing lossmaking operations in Europe and Australia and to make investments in a Chewy like website for gaming.

Has management been doing anything? Yes. A lot.

[It's hiring talents for building a successful online gaming store.](https://careers.gamestop.com/en-US/search?keywords=&amp;location=Grapevine,Texas,USA&amp;placeid=ChIJX6Af7HUqTIYRDS8xoHABMCw&amp;facetcitystate=grapevine,tx) [Entered into a multi-year revenue-sharing agreement with Microsoft.](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/)

It has also received a saving grace by the newest console cycle in which some people thought(like me) diskless gaming is going to be the leader. But the reality turned out to be [quite the opposite.](https://www.pcmag.com/news/report-only-25-percent-of-ps5-pre-order-stock-is-cheaper-digital-edition)

Add to that, the Nintendo Switch sold like wildfire in the US and is going strong, you have a winning combination for GameStop which would likely result in good quarters for the coming quarters.

Management has also started a rebranding effort with some changes being made to its logo, items that are kept in-store and online etc.

It seems like management is likely to address Cohen's concern and the lifeline it has received or will be receiving from the newest console could be its saving grace. If it can turn around or the management gives guidance that it CAN turn around its business model a short squeeze is imminent.

Why would it be inevitable?

[Notice that short interest is almost 3 times higher than its float and more than outstanding shares,](https://imgur.com/a/O3uggvr)

GME as a company is still relatively undervalued (assuming it doesn't go under). If the shorts realize that this company is not going to 0 as they have probably assumed, they will be forced to cover their shorts.

The above-mentioned condition of short interest would guarantee that they have to cover. Also considering the average daily volume, this squeeze can last much longer(3-4 days may be) than the other historical squeezes like Volkswagen short squeeze [when it became the most valuable company in the world for a short while.](https://archive.is/0sDgO)

But given that the scenario surrounding GME is unprecedented, there is no telling how it could end up other than to say that it will be MASSIVE.

[Some shorts are already under water.](https://imgur.com/a/86cGFUl) Some of them are likely covering as noted by various Redditors and retail investors who are looking at the stock tick by tick. Also considering that short interest rose to a whopping 309.83% and is now down to 297.13% (as of this writing from Morningstar data), it's obvious that some of it were covered.

The recent stock price appreciation could be a result of that plus the expectation of good quarterly earnings report.

**Retail mania:** There is considerable retail interest in this stock. Considering that this stock is being heavily promoted in [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets) and driven by that a lot of people are buying shares. According to a survey conducted there(not that reliable, but a good indicator of interest), that subreddit alone has enough ownership to get a board seat.

Open Interest in call options is also [huge](https://imgur.com/a/UvxIGqt) considering that this is only a $1B market cap company. It's filled to the brim with OTM call options(from December 4 to April and further). And market makers and option sellers would have to hedge to serve this crowd, in turn increasing the stock price.

This, in turn, could create a feedback loop where the shorts have to cover their positions, leading to a further increase in stock price, which would force market makers to purchase more shares which could increase stock price and on and on until it triggers a squeeze of epic proportion.

**Likely improving financial health:** [GME announced voluntary redemption of senior notes.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2124246/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Voluntary-Early-Redemption-of-Senior-Notes.html) Management has decided to redeem $125M of its senior notes. This is signalling that the company has managed to generate enough cash flow to cover its debt early.

It could even help improve its credit rating which would help it attract institutional investors more and other perks that come with improved credit ratings.

[Declining debt](https://imgur.com/a/G518yz8) is necessary as it would ultimately help deleverage the company and put it in a more sustainable footing which is ultimately what is needed for avoiding bankruptcy.

**Technical analysis:** This is not my forte. I have bare-bones knowledge in TA and only use it for entry and exit purposes.

But according to some retail investors in Reddit and tradingview GME has formed [a cup and handle bullish pattern](https://imgur.com/a/gj9pzZS).

**Analyst Upgrades:** Analysts are upgrading GME stock. Well, that's good, I guess.

# The Case For Bankruptcy

The scenario in which a short squeeze doesn't occur is PROBABLY the scenario in which GME ultimately faces bankruptcy.

As the thesis for short squeeze is laid out, the thesis for the short sellers is also crystal clear.

After all, GME is STILL a large brick and mortar store that is trying to sell a product that could be very easily purchased using the power of the internet.

The revenue of GameStop for the past few quarters is in [steep decline.](https://imgur.com/a/mTcwpIe) The company is overly leveraged and has many stores that are loss-making operations.

Its online store has much lower visibility and investment and is lacking in many aspects(in my personal view).

Its credit rating is not that good and Cohen himself somewhat criticised the management for trying to hang on to its old ways of doing things.

Gaming and associated products are bound to [thrive and grow at a CAGR of 9% and had grown even more in the past.](https://www.reportlinker.com/p05903704/Gaming-Industry-Growth-Trends-and-Forecast.html)

Yet GameStop FAILS to capitalize on this trend and is continuously losing market share while destroying its [financials.](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/gme/financials) This is a clear sign that something is inherently broken within the company.

While the management does seem to be trying to fix things, it could prove to be too little too late.

To change its fortune it needs to turn around its business models like Best Buy or Walmart. Yet it seems pretty unfeasible judging by its financials.

GameStop had adequate time to change with the times and become an early adopter but its backwards-looking culture and late entry made its journey full of competition.

Short sellers believe that ultimately GameStop wouldn't be able to achieve a business turnaround and gain a critical mass of customers in its online space and management incompetency will ultimately lead to its bankruptcy. Thus its faith would be like the numerous mom and pop shops or the various retail giants that were.

Even if GME share rises due to retail mania and market maker hedging; institutional investor ownership could [decline](https://imgur.com/a/04i3a0g), leaving retail investors as the ultimate bagholders. The shorts may bite their tongue and keep on paying interest as long as they believe no fundamental change in the business is going to happen.

Which means they may not need to cover their position as long as the company becomes bankrupt, thus the fabled short squeeze may never materialize.

After all, most shorts are probably institutional investors like Melvin Capital who can always maintain their margin requirements and like the retail investors they can also figure out what the retail investors are trying to do and thus avoid triggering any short squeeze.

They may think, well, game sales are slowly becoming more and more digital, ultimately, platform holders wouldnt give a shit if GME died and die they will. Because the most lucrative part of GME's business is buying and selling old games. So this will ultimately die.

Plus, game related merchandize and other products(which are very lucrative and a huge market) would still remain under the clout of Amazon, Walmart etc, so GME will not be able to survive through that business model.

# Conclusion

The next two or three quarters are pivotal for GME.

    If
    "Management decides to address Cohen's concerns and manages to show their roadmap to success and improves its financials within the next two quarters = Short squeeze"
    
    Else If
    "Cohen declares hostile takeover or something close to that line= Short squeeze"
    
    Else If
    "Management addresses Cohen but fails to deliver within the next two quarters and has disappointing earnings=Unsure" #improbable cause next two quarters are expected to be good or at least the guidance which is more important
    
    Else If
    "Management doesn't fully address Cohen's concern, Cohen also doesn't make any move yet the business improves still= Likely short squeeze"
    
    Else If
    "Management fails to address Cohen's concern, Cohen disassociates himself, business fundamentals detoriorate= Retail bagholders"
    
    Else
    "I don't know really, imagine your own scenario, you are not bound to my conclusions. In fact my conclusions could be entirely off the mark. We are trying to predict the future here. Hope you come to your own conclusions. :)

# Disclaimer

There are various nuances that I avoided writing(which are probably even more important to write) cause it might have taken too much of my time. Writing this post was a good exercise for me and I decided to ride on the GME train after doing so. Before you decide to do anything, you should do your research. This is not financial advice.

Title: Smart Sand... EV = Washed up. Ride this old-school rocket to Tendie Town!
I've been making money off this OIL PLAY so time to share the love. Grab your flip flops because we're going to the beach. Smart SAND (lookup the ticker)

"Whatttt??? Not an EV or software play???"

1. Shut the fuck up retards and open your eyes!
2. How the fuck do you think they get the energy to charge those things

Buckle up retards, the oil industry is slowly climbing back and oil stocks are BOOMING right now. Gay tech stocks have seen their day and its time to rotate back into these stocks that are oversold (Industrials, O/G, etc). Small Cap is also being slept on, Mega/large cap is way overpriced and there is way too much room in small cap to ignore this play.

Combine Small Cap and ignored sector (OIL) and you get Smart Sand (look it up)

What?

They mine, manufacture and sell sand to fracking companies and like the rest of the Oil energy, they have gotten abused by COVID and other factors.

Why?

UP 75% since OCTOBER. This is a value stock that is MOONING. Value stock?? I know that sounds gay but listen the fuck up. This isn't your grandpa's value stock. This thing is up 50% in the past month and still has room to run. Balance sheet is clean and they are still HEAVILY discounted off pandemic lows and they have room to RUN.

You didn't read anyways so here's what I got:

1. Q3 earnings beat expectations and issued BULLISH guidance for Q4
2. Strong uptrend since end of October
3. New acquisition that will give access to ship to new markets.
4. As oil recovers from COVID this company is only going to keep going up
5. Its insanely undervalued when you dig into the financials (ATH is $19)
6. Very low debt + suffering/over levered competition = Solid Acquisition Prospects
7. High insider buying/ownership AKA they're bullish

Title: The mouse is going to $200 ($DIS)
Did any of you retards watch their investor day?l preso?
[I fucking told you guys](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k48jqi/support_the_mouse_and_buy_dis_ahead_of_december/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) last week and Disney is now at all time highs in the after hours. 

DIS now expects 300-350M total global subs across their streaming services in FY24 (inline to ahead of NFLX by that year) with a global DTC content expense of $14-16B in FY24. 

Bigger subs &amp;amp;amp; bigger spend is a combo that investors welcome and this will help to bring those on the sidelines into the story with a clearer path to $200 (~16x $6 + $100/sh in DTC which is ~8-9x sales)
 
DIS announced that as of Dec 2, their portfolio of DTC services exceeded a total of 137M global paid subs, including Disney+ subs of 86.8M (ahead of cons at ~83M at YE and vs prior guide of 60-90M by FY24), Hulu at 38.8M (vs prior FY24 guide of 40-60M) and ESPN+ at 11.5M (vs prior FY24 guide of 8-12M).

Position: 15x DIS leaps $150-180c expiring in 21-22.

Title: I Have no idea what I'm talking about but $FLR to the fucking moon. Tendies for u and tendies for me.
 Okay, so first of all. Long time failed Robinhood investor first-time poster. You guys have helped me a lot so I want to give this DD thing a try with a stock think is going to the moon.  

It's no secret that techs stocks bring home the juiciest of tendies, but I want to talk about one I haven't seen mentioned in a little bit. 

So here's why this shit is mooning like your slow cousin ralphie when he was supposed to be playing the right field in the near future in my incredibly untrained opinion. Our friends or enemies or tech rivals or whatever you want to call them over in CHINA have unveiled [nuclear fusion](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/a34875771/china-turns-on-artificial-sun-nuclear-fusion-reactor/), so the rich bois in America are going to panic. This was days ago and I'm sure Americans in this field are shitting their pants. Here's the truth, our over-demanding, over-reactive, dying for public approval government is going to PUSH this shit. It's happening in Europe and every other advanced company. 

&gt;Well OP who on this side of the great oceans are working on this? - You right now

**Fluor Corporation (FLR)** 

Ta da! Let me introduce you to Flour, a company with truly undesirable name to say out loud. Flour is a big construction company that works on crazy big, customized projects that have never been done. Look em up, they do EVERYTHING. But so here's why it's related. As long as Portland, Oregan can keep standing, these boys are one of the top candidates for [Nuclear Fusion in the USA.](https://www.fluor.com/about-fluor/corporate-information/innovation/nuscale-power-smr)

Now I'm no expert but I know how big headed Americans are and I know that they want to be the best so this company is mooning before your grandma kisses you under the mistletoe with her tongue and calls you jimmiie levan, her high school bf's name who has been dead for 23 years. 

Now again, I have no clue what I'm doing but here's my final verdict and TL/DR: It's about 18.00 a share now, and up 4 dollars in the last month, but it's going to the GOD DAMN MOON. I don't know the cap here but if their tests are successful I think they'll be the primary builder of these new game-changers for the entire country. 

**Position: All the shares you can afford long term, $19C 12/11 (have had this for a while, let's go Friday!), $22C 1/29/21.** 

I'm hoping to get more cash in there to buy more tendies. Let me know how I did for my first post and please don't ban me if I did bad, I'm just trying to help back and make wendys run out of BBQ sauce again and maybe even afford a tesla option one day.

Title: The next EV play: Why Lion Electric is a sleeping giant
As we have all been witnessing it, EVs are the market movers of this quarter. Massive run ups on multiple stocks that Im sure youre all very familiar with now: Arrival, Chargepoint, Luminar, Canoo. You are hearing about these stocks after they are already up 200-300%+ but what if you could get into the next big play before everyone else? I present you THE next money maker: **Lion Electric**

***What is*** [*Lion Electric*](https://thelionelectric.com/en)***?***

They are a B2B company that produces all electric medium to heavy-range vehicles

**Lion positions itself as a leading OEM in transportation electrification in North America**

[Link to youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsOuM1G2yho&amp;ab_channel=LionElectric)

Currently **3 buses (1 shuttle bus and 2 school buses)** \+ **4 trucks (class 6, class 8, refrigerated and refuse)** that are READY TO PRODUCE AND SELL. Yes even your [Trash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsNQwjXDP4&amp;ab_channel=LionElectric) can be picked up by Lion right now.

***Why would I pick Lion Electric over all the other cool EV stocks?***

Lion is more than just concepts and dreams:

 Currently 7 different trucks and buses **AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE**

 They **ALREADY have 300+ vehicles** on the road with over 6mil miles (it works)

 Multi-year **deal agreement of purchase up to 2500 vehicles** (Lion6 and Lion8) in June 2020

 **Amazon purchased 10 trucks** to try them out; first trucks going to be delivered in the next few weeks  If Amazon likes these trucks potential to buy much more. NOTE: Yes Amazon has deals with Rivian and eMotors but they are for the VANS which is completely different than what Lion offers.

 **CN** (huge Canadian transporter) recently [Purchased 50 trucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15U4DjRLkqA&amp;t=41s&amp;ab_channel=LionElectric) \- again there is a chance to increase size of order later

***What is to expect in the next years?***

USA expansion expected to be completed by 2022

 New production facility to be built in USA in order to increase production

 Allows them to brand as Made in America to help with sales + proximity to USA market

 Jobs open in the USA for the expansion [as seen here](https://emploislion.com/en/jobs)

&amp;#x200B;

***Sales and revenue projection:***

Obviously, its only projections and we dont know how this will play out but the projections are very [reasonable compared to the other EV startups](https://i.redd.it/mhgsmigxjw361.png) courtesy of [u/GullibleInvestor](https://www.reddit.com/user/GullibleInvestor/)

 Revenue of 3.6 billion dollars in 2024

 Cash flow positive in 2023

 EBITDA of approx. 16%

 Cost reduction of 50% in 2024 = better profit margins

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR/Conclusion**:

 Lion Electric offers huge potential to grow in the near future

 Many heavy-type vehicles not being offered by competitors yet: Lion can take your trash and soon transport you in their ambulance when you have heart attacks on red days

 Ahead of the game: Trucks and buses already beings sold (CN, Transdev, Amazon, multiyear 2500 vehicle deal) = potential to have bigger orders if these big companies like the product

 Manufacturing site in the USA to be ready by 2022 to increase production and sales

Note that they only recently started to sell the trucks and that deals are to be expected in the near future. They are able to produce 2500 vehicles a year already. They are actively presenting their products now so its only a matter of time for more deals to pop up. [Link to twitter for proof](https://twitter.com/LionElectricCo)

Everything points to huge outcomes in the future. Buy and hold.

I suggest visiting their website and watching their Youtube videos to understand the company better.

Now get this: they are trading at a $1.69(nice) billion market cap. that's ~74x less than what shopify is trading at right now, despite over 4x less revenue and over 4x less profits than QFIN last quarter. QFIN is also growing at a considerably faster pace and is on pace for around 14 BILLION in revenue. Now this isn't about SHOP being overvalued(which it is), but it's about QFIN being massively undervalued while growing like crazy. I wouldnt be surprised at all to see 10X+ growth over next year. If someone else wants to take a deeper dive and do more DD, please do.

Title: AbCellera (ABCL)\IPO Friday - Peter Thiel, AI, Machine Learning Biotech
Why are none of you degenerates talking about ABCL?

[ABCL](https://www.abcellera.com/) is a full-stack AI-Powered drug discovery platform that searches and analyzes the database of natural immune systems to find antibodies that can be developed as drugs (so they say).  Yes, another biotech company but they already have 26 partnerships including [Eli Lilly for LY-CoV555](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/abcellera-tapped-by-lilly-for-its-covid-antibody-therapy-sets-ipo-terms-5b-valuation) (covid treatment).  The US government already ordered $375M worth of the drug.

Besides all of that, this thing is backed by non other than Peter Thiel, the savant that helped bring us Paypal, Palantir, Facebook, AirBnB, Linkdin, Yelp and many others.  This guy basically shits gold.

We should all follow Peter Thiel to tendie town on anything he touches.  ABCL has their IPO tomorrow and will most likely start trading around 11am eastern.  This thing might not dip below it's debut price.

Positions: none but going HAM at the debut

Title: $FCX  is a boomer battleship thats full-steam ahead!  
$FCX is the next big play. Heres why:

Investors are piling into wagers on industrial metals like copper and nickel, betting that coronavirus vaccines and stimulus programs will drive a boom in manufacturing activity as part of a global economic resurgence.

Prices for copper have risen to their highest level in almost eight years. Iron ore, the main ingredient of steel, is one of the best-performing assets in 2020.

And shares of metals producers, including Freeport-McMoRan Inc. ($FCX) are on a tear, climbing alongside other stocks closely tied to economic growth.

As opposed to precious metals like gold, which serve primarily as a store of value, industrial metals actually have utility. Metals like copper are used in real estate construction, automobiles and other manufactured goods.

$FCX is one of the largest copper mining firms in the world, and one of the few that are American... this could prove important should tensions between USA-China escalate and government tariffs be applied to foreign producers/sellers of copper material.

Title: Final update and predictions for $NVAX: time is running out to get in before take off
I continue to get questions about NVAX and decided to make one final post for current and prospective NVAX holders. For those who didnt read my previous posts ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k08ya1/dd_from_an_actual_scientist_nvax_might_not_be/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k35zlh/followup_dd_from_an_actual_scientist_about_nvax/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5464b/from_the_scientist_who_posted_the_nvax_dd_updates/)), Im currently a biomedical PhD candidate and have &gt;5yrs of experience in vaccine R&amp;D. 

&amp;#x200B;

Due to several persistent misconceptions, NVAX is insanely undervalued and is poised to take off in the very near future due to the upcoming interim readout of their Phase 3 UK trial which will support global licensure. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I say that I think NVAX will take off, consider that it went from $90/share to over $140/share in 4 trading days on news about setbacks to AZN's trial, which is nothing compared to the impact of the upcoming interim readout.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on \*current\* supply deals alone, NVAX is projected to supply more doses of their COVID vaccine to the world in 2021 than Pfizer and Moderna combined, yet NVAX sits at a market cap of $7.3B. For reference, MRNA and CVAC - two other companies with no marketed products - have market caps of $61B and $23B, respectively. Also consider that not only does CVAC have no marketed products, their COVID vaccine is still in Phase 2 (NVAX started Phase 3 in September) and their Phase 1 data looks weak (NVAX's Phase 1 data is arguably best to date).

&amp;#x200B;

With the supply/distribution constraints for Pfizer and Moderna, I suspect NVAX will ink several additional agreements upon release of their Phase 3 interim data. Earlier today, Australia increased their [order](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-12-11/coronavirus-live-blog-december-11-covid-vaccine-trials/12972448) from 40M to 51M doses due to issues with an in-country vaccine.

&amp;#x200B;

# If all of this is true why is NVAX's market cap so low?

I suspect that the *primary* reason for NVAX's low market cap is the misconception that NVAX is too far behind Pfizer/Moderna/AstraZeneca to matter because their US Phase 3 trial hasn't started. 

**The market doesn't seem to appreciate that they started a 15,000 person trial in the UK on September 24th which will support global licensure if successful** (my [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k08ya1/dd_from_an_actual_scientist_nvax_might_not_be/) post outlined why I think the probability of success is extremely high)**.** Rarely do I see this mentioned in NYT, Bloomberg, or WSJ articles on COVID vaccine updates and as a result, I think NVAX is being incorrectly viewed as a longshot.

Although it's not definite, the UK trial will also likely be able to support a US EUA due using a trial design harmonized with US requirements. Regardless, the timing for the US market is not nearly as important due to the fact that their funding from Operation Warp Speed ($1.6B) guarantees purchase of 100M doses as long as a viable vaccine can be delivered. There are no stipulations that they need to be first to ensure purchase.

&amp;#x200B;

  

# When will we get the interim readout and why is this important?

The UK trial originally had a planned interim readout at 66 events, but that's been moved up to 50 events due to anticipated high levels of efficacy (confirmed the validity of the screenshot in my last post). This means that once 50 people in the trial develop symptomatic COVID, they'll unblind and determine the percentage of people who received the vaccine versus the placebo. This type of readout is what supported the announcements made by Pfizer on 09Nov and by Moderna on 16Nov.

 A positive interim readout (anything &gt;90% effective) would be enormous because it would vault NVAX into the spotlight alongside PFE/MRNA. NVAXs $7.3B market cap would quickly be in the rear view mirror. Full approval in the US would still require completion of a US based phase 3 trial (set to start imminently) but as I mentioned, US supply deal of 100M doses is already confirmed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, so when will we get 50 events in the trial? 

The official language used in company press releases says that the interim data are expected "as soon as early first quarter 2021, although the timing depends on the overall COVID-19 rate in the region." However, that was before they decided to change the threshold from 66 to 50 events. Also, their president of research also indicated in a meeting on November 24th that he thinks they'll get there before the end of the year because the trial is centered in several locations in the UK with extremely high rates of transmission. 

Since I have &gt;90% of my portfolio invested in NVAX options, I wanted to get some more confidence around the timing of when the trial would hit 50 events and put together a model to estimate a timeframe. Although this might seem like a ridiculous exercise, I actually think it's semi-reasonable due to the meticulous level of detail that the UK's Office of National Statistics [maintains](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/datasets/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveydata) regarding COVID infections and the daily modeled incidence rates they publish.  

&amp;#x200B;

# Going through the details of the model is probably overkill for WSB so skip to the end if you dont care. Im including it so I can get feedback from anyone with a stats background

Using public statements about trial enrollment numbers, I assume three periods of linear enrollment from 24Sep to 27Oct (0 to 5500), 28Oct to 09Nov (5501 to 9000), 10Nov to 27Nov (9001 to 15000). Per the clinical trial protocol, events are eligible to be counted 7 days following the second injection. As a result, infections for participants injected on day 0 (24Sep) arent counted until 22Oct (1st shot + 21 days for 2nd shot + 7 days). Screenshot below should help to explain better if that's not clear. I also assume a 10% dropout rate, a 15% asymptomatic rate, and a 100% vaccine efficacy rate (this actually makes the projection more conservative).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3cmnb8pz6h461.png?width=625&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ccfa13f90793285b382d0f2ebeb3f9134e41654

Because the probability of infection increases over time and there are different rates of infection on different days, I treat each row of the above table as an independent group to estimate the number infections over time based on the daily modeled infection rates. A screen shot of the table I used is below.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h5mciai07h461.png?width=463&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed9031712307e8052df3559e45397c313f47fc22

 I divided each daily number by 10,000 to calculate an individual incidence rate per day and then used these daily incidents rates to determine cumulative incidence rates over different periods of time and then apply that to each group of participants in a rolling window. See below to get an idea of the calculation. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eplpltd17h461.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e1c1bbb6940c5b65db7145c7cf4e236769548b4

The modelled incidence rates from ONS stop at 22Nov. For the dates beyond then and into the future, I duplicated numbers on the low end from the published period, which is probably more conservative than what well see in reality. Another important difference is that the modeled incidence rates are for England (pop. 55M) but the trial is performed across the entire UK (pop 66M) which also makes the incidence rates more conservative. Im ok with these factors being too conservative since the linear enrollment assumption is almost certainly too optimistic.

**With those caveats, my model estimates that the trial will accumulate 50 events between December 12th and December 20th.**

I think this is reasonable, however I don't have a statistics degree and am open feedback assuming anyone actually read all of this.

&amp;#x200B;

  

# Conclusion and Final Predictions

We can debate NVAXs management team and ability to deliver on manufacturing output, booster revenue, and a whole bunch of other things I addressed in previous posts but Ill spare you bc none of it matters for what happens in the next 2-4 weeks.

The success of this trade will be based on 1) whether or not they announce positive interim results and 2) the timing of the announcement. If results are positive and they're announced in the ballpark of my estimated timeframe, then it could be an easy 500% return depending on the contracts you buy. 

I wouldnt be shocked if the stock dips a few more times prior to announcement in response to Pfizer/Moderna news, but I think were close to the bottom. Im not comfortable missing an announcement so Im not gonna bother trying to time it perfectly but keep that in mind.

Ive settled in on a strategy of buying a few grand worth of OTM weeklies while building a core position of January 15th options on dips. Overall options volume isnt great so Ive been picking my strikes based on volume and have a ton of Jan 15 150c and 160c. See previous posts for proof. 

If your risk tolerance isnt high then regular shares arent a bad move because this is gonna move enough to still make good return and theres potential for big swings until an announcement is made.

&amp;#x200B;

**Final Predictions**

 Announcement of initiation of Phase 3 US trial between 11Dec and 18Dec 

 50 events recorded achieved between December 12-20; press release within 7 days of events being achieved (December 19-27)

Title: $MDB IS ABOUT TO SELL/CORRECT
Fellow autists, heres a little DD for you.

$MDB has gone up 16% the last week, 50% the past 3 months and 148% over the past year. Today they have ran up another 13% on no fresh news. Dont get me wrong, this stock looks great for long term, itll most likely be 400$ by end of next year, but the short term has too much hype behind it, a lot of these simps trying to get into the next biggest software. 

Yesterday, 12/9, they reported earnings. Overall Q3 was a loss but Revenue surged almost 38% year over year, at 150.8 million$, and surpassed the consensus mark by 8.9%.
They also added 2,400 customers by the end of the quarter, and 2,800 direct sales customers.
They currently have 14.9 million in free cash outflow, but they have raised their expenses in research and development(R&amp;D), and general and administrative (G&amp;A) expenses. G&amp;A expenses increased 21.3% and R&amp;D increased expenses by more than 33%.

So what?
Piper Sandler maintains an OVERWEIGHT rating, increased price target from 310$ to 328$
Da Davidson kept a neutral rating, raised price target from $250 to 275$
Goldman Sachs maintained a neutral rating as well, raised price target from $245 to $280
Canaccord Genuity raised price target from 290$ to $315
Oppenheimer keeps outperform rating and price target of $300

IMPORTANT. Also if I may add, put options are down over 1000$, and are pretty much free money lying on the ground, you dont want to walk past this...

Now there was no company specific news today, but the tech sector as a whole had a rally yesterday before rapidly selling off into after hours. Today was just continued momentum off of earnings. 
This company faces a lot of short term challenges. Theyre waiting on lawmakers progress for stimulus negotiations to move further, and Analyst Ittai Kidron wrote one a research not to investors, while management still appears conservative near term, we remain bullish given stronger customer usage/growth trends. 
Now I have full belief that long term they will continue, but based on others in their sector such as OKTA, and CRWD, $MDB is due for a correction. Based on the fundamentals and technicals, theyll fall back to around 300$-285$ and hold their previous highs as new support levels. Which would be 285$-300$, consolidate and continue to push up. 
Yesterdays sell off wasnt a correction, it was sector based, and nothing to do with the actual company. Todays run up was just giving it room to fall back and consolidate to push higher into 2021.

I have 290$ and 295$ Puts for 12/18/20, I wont be holding these until expiration, plan on selling before Wednesday next week!

Title: Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is the next big play - PRPL part 2
If you werent in Purple when it popped then you fucked up, and here is your next chance.

\*Infrastructure and Energy Alternative has options now were added recently. Also has warrants.

THIS IS NOT A SPAC. HAS NOT BEEN A SPAC FOR OVER 2 YEARS.

(Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is a renewable energy construction company that has grown massively since its SPAC days in 2018. At the time the company was pulling about 460mm of revenue, and now has a back log of about 2bn +, while also becoming cash positive (last 2 quarters they posted positive eps, with the latest at .33 eps). EBITDA increased from 36mm to a whopping 125mm. Infrastructure and Energy Alternative currently trades at roughly 6x EV/EBITDA.

What does this all mean?

If you have been paying attention you would notice a lot of green energy companies have been flying. We are looking at insane valuations for certain companies which are all becoming overvalued. Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is NOT overvalued and is in fact the opposite and WAY UNDERVALUED. This company has a market cap less than 260mm but pulls 2bn in revenue (and is currently profitable AND still growing). Infrastructure and Energy Alternative has a P/S of 0.13. madness.

With Bidens 2 TRILLION infrastructure plan, Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is poised to pull in more and more revenue while winning more contracts. In a few years this is a company that could potentially be pulling 8bn + revenue if they keep up the same level of growth since 2018. They also do civil work but 70% of their revenue comes from renewables. They are #1 in Wind and #12 (and growing) in solar nationwide. In their last CC they highlighted the fact that they will continue to focus on solar and are looking to cement more and more contracts in this area.

They currently sit at $11.35/share with the warrants at 1.53. Current market cap is about 250mm.

My short term target here is $20 per share, which is still under 500mm market cap so even at $20 this is laughably undervalued. Infrastructure and Energy Alternative has a small float (around 23million OS) but heavy insider ownership so the tradeable float is actually a lot smaller, so this can move quickly with enough volume. I have been watching this and with only 1million in volume it has pumped 20-30% in a day. The ATH of mid-14s was just a few weeks back and the stock has slide since then (there has been no bad news possible manipulation here). So at the very least, you SHOULD see around a 50% gain short term as Infrastructure and Energy Alternative should surpass recent ATH.

Infrastructure and Energy Alternative in comparison to other companies:

RUN: Has over 200m shares os and 10-13B MC, with only 875m annual Revs and 8.9m Net Profits. Infrastructure and Energy Alternative Revenues and profits are greater.

ROAD: 1.5bn Market cap (6x greater than Infrastructure and Energy Alternative market cap) and trades at x12 EV/EBITDA (double Infrastructure and Energy Alternative). These guys are a construction company as well but focus on roads (obviously) and have nothing to do with the bullish green/renewables sector. Also less revenue than Infrastructure and Energy Alternative. ROAD eps is a bit higher though.

There is a looming 1bn massive solar project from Invenergy. No contract award has been announced yet but Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is definitely in the picture. Infrastructure and Energy Alternative HAS A HISTORY WITH INVENERGY. This is the largest solar project in USA history. If Invenergy chooses Infrastructure and Energy Alternative again for this project you best believe the stock is going to moon. I repeat, Invenergy and Infrastructure and Energy Alternative have a history of doing work with each other.

I like the warrants more that the commons, why?

Below is roughly what the warrants will trade at in comparison to the commons:

Commons  Warrants

11-13  1.50  
14 - 2  
15  2.50  
16 - 3  
17  3.50  
18  4  
19  4.50  
20  5  
21  5.50  
22  6  
23  6.50  
24  7  
25  7.50

A double from here in the commons (11s  22s) is a 100% gain while $22 commons would result in roughly $6 warrants, so roughly a 300% gain from the current $1.50 warrants price. This is just short-term mind you.

Warrants cannot be called in by Infrastructure and Energy Alternative unless the commons trade over $24 for 20 out of 30 trading days. WARRANTS EXPIRE IN 3 YEARS. These warrants are like a 3 year call option.. even at $25 a share the market cap is still only around 500mm market cap.

The fundamentals here for Infrastructure and Energy Alternative are strong as fuck and you can play this in many ways: go long (set and forget) the commons, send it with options (options became available a few weeks ago!) and/or go with the warrants and possibly make fucking bank.

The bear case?

Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is a construction company. Margins are thin. BUT, revenue has grown by 4x in 4 years and is poised to continue growing. They have become cash positive in this time and profitable. There is no indication that this should change. All signs point to continued growth and improved margins. They have already stated the plan to pay down debt (around 300mm) so that alone will increase EPS and margins.

If you look at the historical chart. You will notice Infrastructure and Energy Alternative got hammered after it merged. This is because Infrastructure and Energy Alternative took on debt to buy civil construction companies to diversify its portfolio of renewable construction companies. There was also expressed interest by Oaktree and Ares wanting to buy the company out for under $6 a share and as a result the stock dwindled lower and lower. The buy out was rejected by the company and as it started to improve covid happened, again crushing the stock. Even when the company was only pulling 500mm in yearly rev, the price was undervalued, and now were sitting at 2bn revenue and growing.

Comparisons to PRPL situation:

Recently Infrastructure and Energy Alternative filed an S-3 shelf registration that hinted that up to $500m could be raised in a secondary offering to fund future growth and possibly to acquire more companies. Purple also had multiple secondary offerings. If you look at PRPL's growth from $8 to $16 to past $25, each rally was after a secondary offering of the founders reselling their existing shares to institutions. Secondary offerings are good for companies that are growing. They expand institutional support (which also creates support levels for the stock) and increases float so that daily volume goes up. Purple's offering was non-dilutive while Infrastructure and Energy Alternative offering might be dilutive. However, there are only 23m shares outstanding for Infrastructure and Energy Alternative right now. If Infrastructure and Energy Alternative had even 100m shares outstanding, a $20 stock price would be a $2B market cap, with revenues projected to exceed $2B in 2021.

Disclaimer: I am in the warrants and will be holding these for a while. My first target is at least $8/warrants. I think $10 warrants will happen here though (commons need to hit $30). PRPLW hit $30 commons and $10 warrants and im confident the same happens here.

Cheers fellas

I haven't been watching INSG all that long but I opened positions about a week ago.  Someone suggested I check the company out.  

From what I understand the company is a wireless 5G provider.  Some of their customers are Verizon, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, etc.

They just released a product in September Called Mifi 2000 5G hotspot and it hasn't really been announced yet.

They also make the hotbox 5G for Verizon I believe.

T-Mobile just dropped their name in some news/press release the other day.  [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-mobile-selects-inseego-5g-142300480.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-mobile-selects-inseego-5g-142300480.html)

So..... You might have heard about Corsair. You know that company that made half of the components of your 5000$ PC.

The company had quite a good run up recently but some fucker analyst made it crash. You might have missed out on the first run but it will skyrocket AGAIN! The public float is really small its 91% owned by institutions, so the price moves easily. That means apes together strong. Gaming has increased massively during the lockdown, in q3 Corsair reported net revenue of 457M a increase of 60% YoY. Their operating income of just under 50M had a 353% YoY increase! They are extremely undervalued at only a 3.2B marketcap.

Title: RIP CentOS (2004-2021), Death to Watson!
Please for the love of all that is holy, and more importantly, for the open source community, dump IBM! They have murdered CentOS which for you non-techie degens, is the holy grail of linux server OS's. No hate to the Ubuntu gay bears. 

**Some actual DD though:**

**Context:**

Ya'll know how the software development life cycle works right? Alpha -&gt; beta -&gt; release candidate -&gt; stable (overly simplified fyi). Red Hat Enterprise linux was sort of like the RC in that mix and CentOS was the stable. Stability is highly important and valuable to business everywhere. 

**So the fuck what?**

What IBM has done this week is announce that instead of CentOS being the stable version, it will become the beta version. On top of that, the current version of CentOS (8) was promised to be supported to 2029. With this change, CentOS 8 will only be supported through 2021. 1 year to deal with this situation is just not enough time for many large organizations.

**What does this mean (aside from fuck watson)?**

This straight up means a fuck ton of companies are going to bail on CentOS and ostensibly, Red Hat altogether, to move to a more stable operating system such as Ubuntu Server. 

"BuT wAiT! MoRe PeOplE wIll jUsT bUy ReD hAt EnTerPRisE LinUx fOr mOar MOnEyz!!!"

No they wont, fuck you, and fuck IBM.

Title: New EV stock $GIK - Invest in the company that delivered more commercial electric vehicles in the US than Ford and Daimler combined
We have seen about a dozen EV companies this year to go public by SPAC, but this one is different. Most of this companies like Fisker entirely base their valuation on projected revenue estimates and have not a single unit sold and driving out on the streets. [GIK is merging with Lightning eMotors](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201210006083/en/Urban-Commercial-Zero-Emission-Vehicle-Company-Lightning-eMotors-to-List-on-New-York-Stock-Exchange-Through-Merger-with-GigCapital3-Inc.).

Lightning eMotors has delivered more commercial electric vehicles this year in the US than [Ford and Daimler combined](https://twitter.com/LightningeMtrs/status/1332377396192837632).

They have many large orders lined up as well, like this one for [600 vehicles](https://www.fleetowner.com/fleet-management/press-release/21144765/fluid-truck-orders-600-lightning-systems-evs). Lightning said in October that it had more than doubled its manufacturing space, ramped up production and that it had doubled its workforce.

Additionally to the delivery vans they are also making [larger trucks](https://lightningemotors.com/lightningelectric-chevrolet-6500xd/) as well as [buses](https://lightningemotors.com/buses/). With Biden as a president we will see a heavy demand for this type of electrified vehicles and a lot of states will roll out their own programs to subsidize companies which invest into electric vehicles. And they also develop and distribute their own charging infrastructure like Chargepoint: [https://lightningenergy.biz/dc-charging-stations](https://lightningenergy.biz/dc-charging-stations)

This is the only company which provides everything for commercial customers to quickly electrify large fleets and to run them cost efficient and reliable. They are backed by big oil, BP invested $40 million in them. In the US alone there were [12.4 million commercial vehicles sold in 2019](https://www.statista.com/statistics/265914/commercial-vehicle-sales-in-the-united-states/).

This is a HUGE untapped market which isn't addressed by Tesla yet, and there already is more demand for electric delivery vans [than can be fulfilled](https://www.autoblog.com/2020/09/09/electric-delivery-vans-high-demand).

Don't make the mistake to think that all of these EV companies are garbage because some like NKLA are. This seems to be one of the few like Chargepoint which actually have their shit together. I am expecting a stock price of $25 minimum within the next few weeks, if it reaches just HALF of the valuation of NKLA right now this could actually go to $40.

Summary:

**Ticker: GIK**

\- Proven tech that works, 1,000s of units delivered

\- 1,500 new units ordered in the last few months alone

\- EV chargers and infrastructure

\- Existing revenue and huge demand

\- Just 0.8 billion marketcap, NKLA currently at 7.1 billion

Title: CEO  CNOOC  A serious Chinese Oil play

You know how all of you cry and moan about DD that comes after the &lt;20% pop? Well, here Im giving you one before.

**Background:** 

CEO is one of the big 3 state backed oil companies in China and is state backed. Think of them as the counter parts to Shell, Exxon, Chevron etc

Oil companies took a dump and have been bleeding since the March crash, but since the announcement of the vaccine last month, almost all of them have pumped up about 30% and are continuing to recover. 
The recovery trend will continue as we are still way off from the pre-covid highs. 

**What happened:**

CEO was following along with the rest of the oil giants and was up 30% in the last month until unexpectedly, the administration black-listed CEO as one of the companies that has ties to the Chinese military. The price went from $120 to $85.

Trumps own executive order is vague and lacks any real directive, so the implications are not completely known.
Regardless, the sell off is extreme over reaction.

**Playing geo-politics:**

* Trump plans to add an additional 89 companies to the blacklist as a part of cementing his legacy of being tough on china. Like most things with Trump, it is unclear what exactly that would mean outside of these companies being delisted from US exchanges in about a years time

* The key thing to note here is that China is not retaliating in its typical fashion. This is because I believe they are confident most of this will be reversed or watered down by the Biden administration. Biden has a history of trying to work with China rather than being confrontational.  

* Oil companies have a huge lobby in America and will do everything in their power to prevent political obstacles. If Biden upholds the order, especially it being against a single Chinese oil company, it may prompt China to retaliate, which will force the US oil giants to put pressure on Biden. 

* For Trump, this executive order is to pressure incoming Biden to make him look weak against China. It is likely that Biden may not reverse the order altogether, but that will make It very likely that he will remove companies on the list that do not actually have much do with Chinese Military.

**Some Numbers:**

CEOs current P/E ratio is around 6.8, this is at all time historical low while the industry average is about double that (12.5). This is reason enough to buy in. 

$85 has support and it bounced off that yesterday, this is a positive sign that it will stay above that price for the foreseeable future.  It has been more than a week since the announcement, and I believe we are at the bottom now. 

**The play:**

Now is the time to buy in before the market starts pricing in the Biden transition. Its only a matter of time in the coming month that will make it clear that Biden doesnt plan on upholding Trumps executive orders, at least not for this company as it has little do with Chinese military.
You can pick up shares as the safe option especially because this has a high dividend, or you can pick up some longer dated options. I have personally picked up 95c 3/19. The spreads are large, so try to get some reasonable, premiums are not that expensive. 

**TLDR**  Get on that China Oil recovery, 95c 3/19 CEO

Title: SSPK The Amazon and Doordash for the Cannabis market
The company provides enterprise software to the cannabis businesses, running their point-of-sale (POS) services as well as aiding with logistics, regulatory compliance, wholesaling, and ordering. Clients pay a monthly fee in a standard SaaS model, with fees for other optional services like featured posts or listing priority on WMHs Weedmaps marketplace.

While the recurring revenue from the enterprise software provides solid value, Weedmaps is where the real opportunity lies.

Weedmaps is WMHs ecommerce platform and listing marketplace that shows customers nearby cannabis businesses. Customers can order packaged cannabis products or deliveries from local dispensaries through the app, as well as leave reviews.

In essence, this makes Weedmaps both an Amazon and DoorDash for cannabis, and amazingly WMH does not currently charge a commission on most transactions on the Weedmaps platform. WMH CEO Chris Beals explained on the companys webcast that this was a decision made to avoid tricky regulatory questions and commercial liability as marijuana remains illegal under US federal laws.

Title: Potential 180% gain. $CIICW is undervalued relative to $CIIC
So, the merger between CIIC and Arrival is pretty much all said and done. Arrival's shareholders (Insiders, Hyundai, Kia, Blackrock and UPS) have already voted in favor of the merger with CIIC.  
They expect the ticker to change some time in Q1.  


UPS currently has 10 000 vans on order and the timeline for Arrival to begin deliveries is Q4 2021.  


CIIC has already rocketed up over 30$/share.

The Warrants however are at a steep discount, with a breakeven of 18.50 per share at the current price. Assuming shares stay flat, potential profit come the merger is just over 12.50 per share. (179% gain). To start losing money, shares would need to drop 40% from here. This literally can't go Tits up.  


TLDR: Buy $CIICW instead of $CIIC for a potential 179% gain with 40% downside protection.

Positions: 2000 warrants - CIICW

Title: Eventbrite (EB) as a vaccine approval play
I'll make this short and sweet cause I, like you, have a negligible attention span but wanted to share my thoughts. I think EB has a ton of upside if vaccine gets approved today. I think there's been low trading volume past two days in anticipation of the vote to approve it. Company has done a solid job cutting costs and has minimized cash burn (beat earnings past 2 quarters) which is impressive seeing as their entire business is focused on people going to events. Also options are pretty cheap considering the upside. They've doubled since end of October so its possible all future vaccine news/approvals are priced in (almost back to price pre-pandemic) but then again people may view the US approving it as beginning of the end (even with the crazy daily numbers but then again stock market isn't too connected to reality these days). Plus I think post-pandemic, people are gonna wanna do a lot of shit to make up for lost time aka go to a ton of events.

Positions: Shares + 12/18 $20c yolo + 1/15 $22.5c 

Think LEAPS are a solid idea here too but felt like gambling today.

Title: Get on the Salesforce (CRM) cloud!
&amp;#x200B;

[Salesforce + Slack](https://preview.redd.it/em1vtiv9xe461.png?width=660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e63995251abf02df5d8e5472fe0c2ad67d52c6a)

OK. Let's do some DD before sinking more money on this. (sources explicitly named)

&amp;#x200B;

**Sheep**

* Nasdaq: 15 recommend a Strong Buy
* Nasdaq: Average price target: $277
* Yahoo: 16/45 recommend a Strong Buy
* Yahoo: 25/45 recommend a Buy
* Yahoo: Average price target: $275
* Morningstar target: $253. Hold
* CFRA target $309. Strong buy
* Thomson Reuters target: $275. Buy
* Market Edge target: $260. Avoid (fuk'em)
* Wallstreetbets target: moon. Less hate than Slack so far

&amp;#x200B;

All things indicate a strong analyst interest and higher valuations. It's not a meme stock (yet?).

&amp;#x200B;

**Crayons**

* Short term support: $188
* Short term resistance: $247
* RSI: near oversold
* MACD: no idea, but it could reverse soon

&amp;#x200B;

Not worth showing questionable charts, you can do your own. I loosely use RSI and MACD to help inform my trades; they both show promise.

&amp;#x200B;

**Propaganda**

Bloomberg just reported that people have stopped returning to the office. The WFH shift is becoming more prevalent as time goes by. People will find new freedom and better quality of life. This continues to be good news for Salesforce+Slack.

&amp;#x200B;

Morgan Stanley upgraded Slack. It says the deal is at full valuation. The deal is expected to close by July 31, 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

Salesforce sets a new long-term sales target at its annual investor day. It now aims to reach more than $50B in revenue in FY26 -- up from a pre-M&amp;A target of up to $35B for FY24.Sales for FY20 at $17B. 

&amp;#x200B;

It looks like CRM will more than double it's value within 5 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Shopping**

* Tableau. $15.7B. Data visualization
* MuleSoft. $6.5B. Integration software
* Demandware. $2.8B. E-Commerce
* ExactTarget. $2.5B. Marketing cloud
* Click. $1.3B. Field service management

&amp;#x200B;

The general consensus is that Benioff has been a smart buyer. CRM's stock performance demonstrate it. Have you heard about a Salesforce M&amp;A blunder ( la Time Warner/AOL, SAP/Qualtrics, Amazon/Whole Foods)? Exactly.

&amp;#x200B;

BTW, Microsoft may have helped Benioff to get Slack for cheap. WORK was a pandemic stock with a solid product and real revenue, and still, they managed to miss the insane valuations that others got due to Microsoft's hard reaction (scared?) and frankly bad PR from Slack. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Now What?**

What do I know. But all future indicators and past performance point to major tendies. CRM price targets paint a great story for 2021. Salesforce was in a major upward trend before the Slack acquisition announcement. Benioff has demonstrated to be a great dealmaker. The Slack acquisition reinforces Salesforce's intention to dominate the enterprise software landscape.

&amp;#x200B;

You know that "stonks only go up", but did you know that Salesforce is part of the Dow as of Aug 2020 and belongs to the S&amp;P 500? Who do you think will prop the them up going forward? You got it right, Sales fucking force dot com.

&amp;#x200B;

TD;LR: Not gonna tell you what to do, but I have 250 CRM and 500 WORK shares. 5x 1/08 $225C, and 1x 12/18 $230C. Planning to load up on calls once the upward trend becomes clear (to avoid getting wiped out, yes I'm being conservative, but my Slack play paid out well).

&amp;#x200B;

Whatever you do, please be careful with way OTM calls and short expiration. A lot of people were burned by WORK because of that. Salesforce is a $200B company that is not a meme stock; for options, it moves slowly until it doesn't.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR^(2): CRM + WORK = 

Title: AI is a 10 bagger with Enterprise AI software the next SaaS/cloud. Buy Google too
Pretty straightforward guys, buy AI before street comes out with their research reports in a month and this stock goes straight to $1,000.

AI enterprise software is the next frontier for software. Cloud/SaaS made enterprise software basically a consumer product where workers could easily jump on/log in to a user friendly platform. CRM etc. mooned because they could rapidly grow users under this model. 

So whats the next step? No more users.

AI and machine learning applications will do all of the work that humans inputting data into software do now. 

Realistically GOOGL has a huge lead on this with Deepmind and has the best tech, but their mkt cap is too big so stock wont move as much as AI.

Dont come crying to me with fomo in a month....

Title: Potentially Solid Run Up to ER Play with FedEx - Shipping it on this play
Let me be clear. I think nearly all of you guys in this sub now are absolute morons. And I don't mean the good kind of WSB Autist. I mean this whole sub is just sheep following the crowd. If that is you, don't read this. If you have only stocks in your Robinhood right now, don't read this. If you just bought GME or Palantir this week, don't read this. Most of you guys just stick to losing money in GME and other crap. 

For the few smart people still here, I think I have a play that may pay very well. FDX (FedEx) is looking like it is primed for a strong run up to ER next Thursday now. It has sold off hard the past two days after two recent price target raises, but has bounced back hard from identical sell offs this past month. It has crushed both of the last ER and has been on a solid trajectory upwards the past few months. It is currently rated a better buy than UPS by most. 

I will be playing this run up to ER. I bought in a little early, but I will likely be holding through next Thursday then selling before earnings. I think this should like hit 305-310 before next Thursday based on previous price action and the highs it hit earlier this week. 

Do what you want with this. I am not a financial advisor.

Title: Get in on the next LAZR before it pops (DM just went public this morning)
If anyone has been paying any attention to the stock market's biggest gains over the past two weeks they would see companies heavily meme'd and now well known (PLTR, LAZR, etc). However, trying to get into any of those now is at worst going to lose you money and at best net you much smaller gains than the trailblazers who already sold for massive profit.

If any of you are interested in what could be the next big play to jump like GMHI did after flipping to LAZR, take a look at Desktop Metals, formerly TRNE. In a deal much like the LAZR launch, Desktop Materials went public with the support of TRNE, and as such the TRNE ticker flipped just this morning to DM. The DM CEO rang the opening bell, had an interview on CNBC, and is now probably enjoying his afternoon with hookers and blow after a killer morning. 

The TRNE stock underlying has increased almost 50% in the last week and over 115% in the past month, but the reasoning behind why this play is still wide open is that it's been behaving very similarly to LAZR. Leading up to the ticker flip for GHMI/LAZR, the underlying jumped a huge amount to the 20s, but then stagnated the day the ticker actually flipped. However, that same day it jumped EOD and then continued to moon into the 40s, before eventually settling to where it is now (note: I'm not saying the stock is done moving in either direction, but it certainly isn't making moves like it was last week). 

TRNE, now DM, has performed very similarly for a few days now, it dips in the morning, hovers around -5% midday, then jumps EOD. Now with national media coverage and the offical public ticker flip to DM, should it jump EOD today, that might be the catalyst for a similar sky rocketing like we all saw with LAZR. Additionally, the risk is relatively low as far as SPAC mergers go since the deal has already gone through and the ticker has already flipped, so should this not moon, it likely won't correct down to $10/share, instead any downwards movement will likely be limited.

One main concern is that both the technology and the name aren't as flashy and meme-able as LAZR, but the company itself is actually much more solid and more likely to be a good long term play. While no degenerate here cares about long term, boomers do. If this starts jumping, expect boomer fomo to take it to the moon or even Mars.

TL;DR
TRNE ticker flipped to DM, behavior and backstory very similar to GHMI to LAZR, we all know what happened there, get in before this stock hits $40 per share ($22/share as of this post)

My positions: 12/18 22.5 calls
12/18 25 calls
1/15 20 calls (I have the most contracts in this and have had these the longest)
10 Shares (spare buying power that I just threw in to track AH performance)

Title: stop comparing ABNB to DASH (some ABNB DD)
ABNB is a good company. DASH is a shit company

bullish case for ABNB:

The rental market is with 1.6T and ABNB has around 20% market share. theres plenty of room to grow 

Unlike a lot of other tech companies (if you want to call these tech companies) such as palantir and doordash, airbnb has not been losing money, theyve been cash flow positive for the past 4 years

They have great YoY revenue 

They held up better than the rest of the rental market during the spring-summer months of the pandemic. in april, their bookings were down 72% while the rest of the rental market was down 85%. In september, their bookings were down 23% while the rest of the rental market was down 50%.

Yes the $155 price tag seems a bit high, but ABNB is actually opening at 9x revenue, while for example, AI opened at 14x revenue yesterday and is still up 35% today. 

Theyre a rental company going public at the peak of a pandemic, if anything, this is the best time to buy into this sector, and ABNB is the way to go for growth.

Title: Buy the inevitable $PTON dip today after vaccine approval news
I will keep this as short as possible.

Vaccine approval news will cause a dip in the stocks that benefited from COVID-19. PTON is also suffering from news that Apple will release Fitness+. Lastly, PTON has had recalls and delivery delays, there will be some Christmas cancelations. Expect PTON stocks to suffer temporary dips. PTON has been dipping to ~109-112 past few days, I can see it going down even lower than that after this week. Buy this dip.

1. Vaccine news =/= COVID disappearing. We're going to suffer at least 4-5 long, cold months, and we're reaching record-breaking daily COVID deaths. People are shutting down, more lockdowns coming. PTON is due for a huge January bounceback. 
2. Fitness+ is compatible with Nautilus Octane which is an inferior bike to Peloton in every way and has a higher subscription cost. Plus the 1,000,000+ people who paid 2k+ for a Peloton aren't going to switch to Fitness+. Their content is not going to match Peloton's for quite a while, they're too new to this game and the Peloton userbase is loyal, 94% positive feedback from owners.
3. New Year's resolutioners will be buying this shit up in January as the weather gets cold and the gyms close back up. Peloton didn't release any stupid commercials this year, they've learned their lesson.
4. ARK Investments bought 200k shares a few days ago. I trust Cathie Wood. Analysts everywhere are upgrading their price targets, not downgrading. 
5. A close above 109.53 should setup 116-118 tomorrow: https://i.imgur.com/FiAW3xf.png

tl;dr: Buy PTON dip, this stock is a rollercoaster so the floor is going to be hard to find, but you can be confident of a rise in January, I expect 125 EOY, 140 by February.

My current position is 115c 2/19/21, waiting for the dip and I will buy some 120c.

Also, tread lightly with stocks because once the vaccine is here and the weather is nice, I don't see this as a long-term investment.

Look Maggots, this stock is on a phenomenal uptrend to tendiesville. Dec 8th it opened at 29.5 and had a crazy uptrend that led into the next day to a high of 31.89. Thats one hell of a gain for a boomer stock that isnt as volatile as lets say AMD and because of this very low volatility, the options are CHEAP. I MEAN CHEAP. Just take a look for yourself on how cheap these options are and today they are discounted because of this pullback we had today. LETS RUN THIS BAD BOY UP!!

Title: The Next PLTR - C3.ai (AI)
I'll make this short and sweet. 

AI is used for making more accurate predictions. If you can make more accurate predictions, you can fucking mint money. What if you could automatically know how much to price a airline ticket to sell out every single time, down to a penny. How about know exactly how many pairs of size 6 leggings you need to make this quarter down to within 0.25%. How about exactly what ads to show someone to maximize dollars spent on Instagram every year. This is what is happening billions times a day behind the scenes. 

&amp;#x200B;

[C3.ai](https://C3.ai) brings the power that has brought AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, and FB to the rest of enterprise. AI models are difficult to deploy, tweak, and manage. This shit is brand new, there is very little talent. [C3.ai](https://C3.ai) helps companies implement AI into their business through their full featured platform. 

&amp;#x200B;

When you are looking for good software you want to find something that is defensible / complex, yet easy to implement, and obviously valuable to the end user. The reason ServiceNow can charge JP Morgan 60 million dollars a year is because it saves them 500. For C3, deploying these models is easy because they have pre-builts that they can adapt to any business, a platform to run them on, is cloud agnostic, and the internal talent that even medium organizations wouldn't be able to find / use effectively. A single AI implementation can be worth 10s, 100s of millions of dollars to an organization, and you don't think they will be happy to pay [C3.ai](https://C3.ai) through the nose to maintain it? AI capability will be table stakes in 2 years, if it isn't already. This is a pure-play on that. Look at the post IPO pop. Its time to go moon hunting boys.

Title: If you hate DASH here's a compelling alternative
I know most of you don't like DASH and I completely agree with the sentiment here. I normally don't post, however, I feel a huge competitor is being overlooked.

Four months ago,Grubhubagreed to an all-stock merger withits European peerJust Eat Takeaway (recently formed by a merger between Just Eat in the U.K. and Takeaway in the Netherlands). The merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021 and Grubhub investors will own 30% of the new company.

Just Eat Takeaway's revenue surged 44% year over year to 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in the first half of 2020. Much of that growth was attributed to restaurant closures and stay-at-home measures during the pandemic.

Its orders rose 32% to 257 million, more than doubling in Germany and rising at double-digit rates across the UK, Canada, the Netherlands, and the rest of the world. Its average order value grew 8% to 22.20 euros ($26.21).

The company remains unprofitable, but its adjusted EBITDArose 133% to 177 million euros ($209 million) as it dialed back its discounts and vouchers in competitive markets like the UK.

In its latest trading update Just Eat said its third-quarter orders rose 46% year over year -- accelerating its year-to-date order growth rate to 37%. That growth was led by a significant acceleration in its orders in Canada, which nearly doubled year over year during the third quarter.

How will Grubhub complement Just Eat Takeaway's growth?

Grubhub's revenue rose 27% year-over-year to $822 million in the first half of 2020. At the end of the second quarter, its number of active diners rose 35% to 27.5 million, its daily average orders grew 32%, and its gross food sales surged 59% to $2.3 billion.

Like Just Eat Takeaway, Grubhub's top-line growth was buoyed by restaurant closures and stay-at-home measures. But its adjusted EBITDA plunged 68% to $34.3 million as it spent more money on safety measures and offered discounts to fend off DoorDash andUberEats.

Just Eat plans to merge Grubhub with its rapidly growing Canadian business. The merger could significantly reduce Grubhub's expenses by eliminating redundancies, increasing its scale, and boosting its pricing power.

Just Eat could also help Grubhub undercut DoorDash and Uber Eats by subsidizing its growth with its European operations, or amplify Grubhub's recent partnership withLyft.


TL;DR Combining Just Eat Takeaway and Grubhub will create the world's largest online food delivery platform outside of China. The main takeaway here is BUY TKWY and if you don't have acces to that market BUY GRUB.

And for the doubters: 

Title: European Defence Spending No brainer
Since Trump pressured Europe to step up its Defence spending more and more European nations actively say they want to follow. Now even some members of the Green Party (Baerbock) in Germany, who are usually very leftist &amp; anti-Defence companies, said that Europe needs to step up its Defence &amp; modernize its Army in an effort to have a stronger voice in international negotiations. Moreover, due to schizophrenic Erdogan &amp; Russias increasing hostility against the west (esp since the occupation of parts of Ukraine) Europe has to massively increase its Defence spending. 
If we now look at the European Defence companies, only few really are still in a position to directly profit. Here, especially interesting is Rheinmetall AG, who are famous for their Defence products such as battle tanks, cannons for the Navi, anti-air middle system &amp; co. The company is currently valued at 3bn while it sales are at around 6bn, half of which are derived from Defence. The other part of the sales are directly related to to supplying automotive parts to OEM, which might experience a renaissance given a recovery of the global economy. Nevertheless, even without the automotive supplies, the company appears to be valued cheaply. As an addition Rheinmetall created a JV with BAE Systems (biggest Defence company in Europe, UK) to produce tanks in GB, moreover the bought out the JV Part of MAN in their JV for armored tanks &amp; tanks. In addition to there is also a possibility to merge with the biggest French tank producer nexter to have an airbus like structure. This would be an enormous boost since France only buys from French companies.
Even without a potential deal Rheinmetall appears to be very cheaply valued, has a high institutional ownership and be perfectly positioned to benefit from rising Defence spending in Europe.

Tl;dr World unsafe, buy tanks.

But Roth Capital analyst David Bain previously said two agreements with tribal operators notched by Everi account for 15 percent of the companys fintech business and were going overlooked by investors. This made the price target shift from $20 to $21 for this guy.

This same article said this about David Bain as well Todays surge by Everi stock may not be a one-off event. *Bain, the Roth Capital analyst, says another customer will roll out CashClub Wallet in the coming weeks.* He didnt identify that operator, but *he did say its one of the largest casino firms in the world*. The analyst adds that on a standalone basis, Everis fintech basis is worth $16 a share. *When accounting for peer average multiples on gaming device suppliers,* ***the stock could trade near $29, or more than double where it resides today.***

I know some you have a hard time reading, but that means we could see news of EVRIs own product (CashClub) be announced to be integrated in one of the largest casinos companies in the world. If that doesnt scream PUMP, I don't know what does

**EVRIs option chain are cheap for long dated calls**

Because I am writing this after hours, the options chain will most likely change come market open, but keep in mind, they will still be cheap.

Looking at January 20c and March 22.5c, they are .18 with a .05-.3 bid/spread and .2-.25.

Yeah yeah yeah, I know what youre thinking oH tHE BiD aSK SpREad is TOO wIdE. But if you guys seriously think the bid/ask spread is what has limited your autistic trades up to this point, then youre just lying to yourself. Get your order filled, because were making fucking tendies.

**THE MEME POTENTIAL OF THIS STOCK IS PERFECT FOR US RETARDS**

*Is there anything that is more ironic than a bunch of degenerate gamblers gambling on a gambling company that is so revered in the gambling industry that its not even a gamble?* FUCK NO THERES NOT.

WE ARE MADE FOR THIS TICKER, AND AS AUTISTS AND GAMBLERS WE NEED THIS PLAY. As many of you know, once a ticker catches fire in this sub it gets HUGE coverage. Look for yourselves at the countless memes and videos of WSB getting coverage on Cramers shows and news outlets. MEMES MEAN MORE ADVERTISING, MEANS MORE PUMPS, MEANS MORE TENDIES, WHICH MEANS MORE MONEY FOR DICK PUMPS.

I rest my case.

TLDR; EVRi is a fucking powerhouse in the online/in-person gambling/casino world. They have lots of news going for them along with having cheap calls, a well run business with great price targets, good price action movement, and most importantly infinite meme potential

Title: $700,000 Bet on Fintech - BFT
Alright Degenerates- I posted a small little snippet a day or so ago about BFT. I wanted to do a bit of DD on BFT but also wanted to highlight something that was brought to my attention by a degenerate gambler. Lastly, I wanted to compile some good little snippets that have been put together by some other members as well as from the investor presentation.

**Before reading further please understand the major Risks.**

* This is SPAC with \~10.00 NAV, if the deal falls through it could drop to 10.00 USD
* The warrants could be very lucrative but they can be called and if a deal fails to materialize, these can become worthless.
* If you're ok with the above risks, continue reading.

Keep in mind that this merger is not complete, but the terms of the deal have been provided to investors and we will be able to either vote yes for the deal or vote no and redeem our shares in BFT for 10.00 cash. So there is downside to this play should the vote not go through or should the two entities terminate the agreement. Right now the downside is \~3 dollars per share according to the close price from today.

# The Customers and MOAT

* Deep Customer Base with deep ties to gambling/betting industry with Deep penetration in Europe and growing customer bases around the world. Gambling is a tricky business and regulated differently than other industries. Many big players have avoided the industry and Paysafe has a great reputation and has become one of the early movers in the industry. The following are some notable customers.

&amp;#x200B;

* A gentleman u/dancinadventures posted this comment on my last post:

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *I actually know Paysafe and the usage quite well.*

*PayPal has many restrictions in Europe regarding iGaming , so does Square.*

*This is a big play on iGaming for those that arent aware.*

*I was a mid- high stakes online poker player through the 2010-2018. Played a variety of sites. : iPoker; PokerStars, Paddy, MicroGaming, 888, Party. Why so many sites? Because I was always on lookout for where the action was, if a big whale sat down at one online casino; you bet your sweet ass Im there.*

*So let me give you my take as a consumer thats probably spent over $100,000 in transaction fees personally on Paysafe.*

*This was one of the cheapest and fastest ways to move money around online.*

*Unlike Stripe this which is against risky business such as CBD and gambling, paysafe is actually one of the leading payment providers in both UK/AUS / Ireland for iGaming.*

*Big example is William Hill, Bet365, Bwin.*

*Now why would you want to move money online around as a gambler ?*

*Well, Visa/MC charge close to 50%-&gt;75% more, online casinos = the merchant. They dont wanna pay that, and in fact put limits on this type of payment processor. (Your visas credit cards etc). If a punter deposits / withdraws frequently, the online casino could literally be on the hook for like 20-30% of the turnover throughout the gamblers period. (This assumes the gambler doesnt lose all his money per deposit.*

*Imagine youre a professional sportsbettor, youre not loyal to one site. Different spreads / odds are offered on every site, you want to be able to move your money from one to another quickly and cheaply. Arbitrage opportunities do exist in sports betting as bookmakers hedge their books to minimize risk, diff frequencies of bets occur on each sports book; you get the idea.*

*For recreational punters, its simple: some sporting events that are smaller simply dont exist on one site that exist on another. Eg. Perhaps you using Pinnacle / 10dimes for low spreads on high volume events, but perhaps you want to gamble on live events on bet365 on another day, and bet ponies on Hill.*

*What if you only have $5000 ? Giant pain in ass to deposit money to each site, paysafe lets you move it around easily.*

*Should you use visa, you may get blocked from depositing on various sites; Bodog, WHill, Bet365 just to name a few. Withdrawals and clearing deposits with bank transfers or checks takes days-&gt; weeks and gamblers aint gonna wait for that shit.*

*You can also buy prepaid paysafe cards from stores if you dont wish to use your real credit card; and load that shit up.*

*One of the biggest markets this is prominent in is South east Asia, they are some of the biggest punters and fucking loving gambling. Looking at you pinoys, Indonesians, Malays. Not everyone wants to fly to Macau to get their rocks off.*

*As much as this is a play on FinTech, please understand this company has more or less the best Payment service on online gambling globally.*

# The Comparable VALUATIONS

From this chart you can see that there looks to be some favorable multiples that could improve once a deal closes. Also, I'm very bullish on the great Margins as well as the conservative growth. I think Foley along with the growing Igaming undervalues the potential of this company. Just the Draft Kings relationship make me tingle.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aozxwuft0b461.jpg?width=722&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e40cbc4538ff3bef87a31050dca316ecae996a9b

* Bill has connections and a strategy to dominate Igaming.
* Igaming addressable Market is expected to grow immensely from a few billion to tens of billions.
* &amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qfacblzz0b461.jpg?width=241&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbcdace95286ffccf613daa79b93554ca3e5728b

&amp;#x200B;

This is an end to end payment processor with big big big name relationships for very disruptive companies that have huge addressable markets. The reason I am excited is because IGAMING is just really starting to take off and Paysafe is a first mover with brand new experienced management and very very fair valuations that could pop after a merger.

TL;DR- BUY BFT stock and BFT.W because BFT stands for big freaking tenies.

Title: LUMN - getting ready for breakout
It may not sound like the sexiest play, but this stock is being acquired in big chunks by big players.  

https://fintel.io/i/scion-asset-management-llc

Michael Barrys Sicon bought 800,000 shares in Q3. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/mason-hawkins-southeastern-strengthens-connection-192315526.html

Southeastern Asset Management, the investment firm founded by Mason Hawkins (Trades, Portfolio) in 1975, disclosed it increased its stake in Lumen Technologies Inc. (NYSE:LUMN) by 3.66% last week.  The firm invested in 2.3 million shares of the Monroe, Louisiana-based telecommunications company on Dec. 3, impacting the equity portfolio by 0.62%. The stock traded for an average price of $10.51 per share on the day of the transaction.

They have also been awarded significant government contracts this year:

They have also partnered with ZM:

https://www.lightreading.com/the-edge/lumen-to-partner-with-zoom/d/d-id/765631


***Whats interesting is the stock took a major hit on Monday evening after hours when it was announced:

FCC Subsidy Results Dim Lumen's Financial Outlook -- Market Talk
Mentioned:	CHTR LUMN
15:29 ET - Shares of Lumen sink more than 5% Monday after Federal Communications Commission data show the telecom company formerly called CenturyLink won about $26M a year under the latest round of federal subsidies for rural broadband service. The new Rural Digital Opportunity Fund payouts come well below the hundreds of millions in annual cash CenturyLink enjoyed under past programs, endangering a stable revenue source. Filling the void with more winning bids: new players like cable operator Charter Communications and SpaceX. (andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.com; @drewfitzgerald) 

Many saw this as a huge blow to revenues, but this was business that sharps believe LUMN did not want to win due to the low margins. 

Plus they have more lucrative contracts already locked up and we all know Elon has no problem running in the red to build a business. 

Actually there were more bidders for ever for this business and the FCC had set aside $16B for this auction and only had to use $9.6B - it was a race to the bottom. 

The average 10-day volume before the dip after hours was 10MM shares a day. 

The next day over 16MM volume and the stock rebounded - it was a buying opportunity for the heavy hitters to add on the dip and they did. 

Today the overall market pulled back and LUMN was up again on higher than normal volume - 13MM. 

It is being acquired by institutions, also the dividend is very attractive for these types of investors that hold 5-7 years. 

The play on LUMN is 5G fiber and here is how:

CenturyLink can thrive in a 5G world
Despite this massive, long-term decline, it could see an upswing as analysts forecast an increase in profits. Why? Put simply, instead of destroying CenturyLink, 5G may have saved the company.

Here's how.

As it so happens, 5G networks remain heavily dependent on fiber. From an infrastructure perspective, the biggest difference between the previous 4G LTE standard and the current 5G is the number of cells needed. Instead of one cell every few miles, 5G requires numerous small cells located close to one another. 

As a result, carriers have exponentially more cells, and they all need to connect to their networks. To do this, carriers such as AT&amp;T (NYSE:T), T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) will need CenturyLink's fiber. Hence, instead of fiber becoming obsolete, it may become more important than ever to the telecom industry.

Which brings me to:

An old company with a new name
Will Healy (Lumen Technologies): The fiber company long known as CenturyLink has become an afterthought as consumers increasingly embrace wireless. Moreover, some investors might assume that a wireless telco industry makes fiber networks obsolete.

They should think again.

The exponentially higher number of 5G antennas will depend in large measure on fiber networks for backhaul. Furthermore, the Internet of Things (IoT) will also rely heavily on fiber to enable edge computing.


Additionally, Lumen is also well positioned for a popular Democratic program -- rural broadband. Based in Monroe, Louisiana, Lumen has used its network to offer high-speed internet to some rural areas. This could help Joe Biden, who has pledged broadband for "every American" in an effort to reach rural voters. Biden also worked to expand broadband access when he was vice president.

Lumen stock has experienced a secular decline since 2007 as consumers dropped landlines and cable TV. Moreover, its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than eight does not seem so cheap given tepid earnings growth. Furthermore, missed deadlines on SEC filings and a falling dividend have also hurt the stock.

However, even the reduced annual dividend of $1.00 per share still yields just over 9%. Also, with a free cash flow of $803 million exceeding the $291 million cost of its dividend in its most recent quarter, the payout should remain safe.

Regardless of who wins the election, Lumen stock could benefit as the company repurposes its network to support 5G and IoT. Nonetheless, if a Biden administration subsidizes rural broadband, Lumen could receive an additional boost.

In summary, this is not Century Link anymore, its something much different and ready to be a 5G PLAYER.  

I would have YOLOd this one as well as I have 140 January 2022 $15c at an average of .50. 

I believe this has the legs and from what I laid out here think $30-40 could be realistic by Q4 2021. 

Lots of value and the big boys know it and are acquiring it.

Title: A I R B N B IPO!
Airbnb has priced its IPO at $68 per share. 

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/airbnb-expected-to-price-ipo-above-56-to-60-a-share-range-11607527468?mod=hp\_lead\_pos6](https://www.wsj.com/articles/airbnb-expected-to-price-ipo-above-56-to-60-a-share-range-11607527468?mod=hp_lead_pos6)

In all likelihood, the stock will open much higher than that. I think Airbnb is a great potential long term buy given that it's IPOing at the worst possible time for travel industry in general. This was the toughest year for Airbnb. Contrast this with DoorDash which had the best year because everyone was avoiding going out. Wall Street is short-sighted. It only sees 2020 revenues and makes foolish decisions. You can be smarter than that. Would you want to invest in a company about to become a travel behemoth and had the worst possible year and and only has good things to look forward to or would you invest in a food-delivery company whose pandemic-fueled, covid-inspired best year is already behind it.

Airbnb has already received a couple upgrades before the IPO. 

Barrons had good things to say about it: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/airbnbs-ipo-will-be-hot-why-its-stock-will-be-worth-the-price-51607120966](https://www.barrons.com/articles/airbnbs-ipo-will-be-hot-why-its-stock-will-be-worth-the-price-51607120966)

I am not a big fan of Scott Galloway but he wrote a neat article on Airbnb and its valuation: [https://www.profgalloway.com/airbnballer](https://www.profgalloway.com/airbnballer)

&amp;#x200B;

I was also impressed with how Brian Chesky handled the Covid pandemic and how Airbnb stepped up to help healthcare workers. Even during fires in states like California, I have seen Airbnb step-up to help first-responders and evacuees. Before the pandemic hit, Airbnb was expected to IPO at over $50B valuation. A conservative firm like Airbnb was valuing Airbnb at $53B - $65B back in 2018.

[https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/3q-2018-morningstar-pitchbook-airbnbs-network-effect-offers-investors-a-unique-stay](https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/3q-2018-morningstar-pitchbook-airbnbs-network-effect-offers-investors-a-unique-stay)

&amp;#x200B;

In the pre-Covid era it was one of the rare profitable startups.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know where it will open but anything under $100 is worth a very serious consideration. Just my 2 cents. Just an FYI, I wanted to post this discussion on Investing or Stocks as well because I am not sure if the audiences are the same. Just want to present a snapshot of what's before us before the IPO.

A bet on Airbnb is a bet on post-Covid recovery.

Title: PERI - Microsoft Contracts, ARK investment, Growing digital ad sector. Put it on your radar.
As CTV options becoming more prevalent and advertising starts to ramp back up, the digital ad sector has been taking off lately with companies like trade desk (TTD) and Magnite (MGNI) mooning over the last few months. One smaller player that has caught my eye that hasn't had the same type of multi-bagger run yet is PERI (Perion Network). These guys have been around for a long time, but have recently started to revamp their business with some good acquisitions and added revenue streams in the last few years.

Great SA article posted yesterday which goes into a hell of a lot more detail and analysis than I will in this post (yeah, yeah, it's SA, but the article itself is actually pretty decent--go find it because I can't link it here). But the bottom line is things are looking solid heading into 2021 here. Just upped their guidance for next quarter, analysts targets all above current price with "buy" ratings, and they just renewed a four-year Microsoft contract expected to generate revenue between $170-190 million annually (according to their investor slide deck). Yes, that's close to a billion dollar contract with Microsoft for a company trading at a market cap of less than than $300 million. This is trading at a huge discount right now and could be an easy multi-bagger from here in my opinion. Stupidly undervalued right now in this sector compared to competitors (MGNI is the most comparable play in my opinion). Oh, by the way, Cathie and ARK are in here as well, with 160k shares as their third biggest holding in their IZRL ETF.

Buy in, or don't, I don't really care. But check it out if you are looking for new play that isn't TSLA, PLTR, or NIO (I'm loaded up in those as well, but I have to keep myself entertained with finding new stuff).

Anyway, I'll probably get downvotes for "PuMpInG a SmAlL CaP," but oh well, i don't care if you buy or not. Do your own research, but this has been a money maker for me this week and wanted to put it on a few people's radars. Sure, it's a small cap, but it's a small float that can move quickly with good volume. Also, option volume and liquidity is actually pretty damn good with tight spreads usually (check out the OI on April 10c, lotta people been loading up and holding). It has had a great week on huge volume (2,000% above average) after raising guidance on Monday, and it also held up exceptionally well today despite the NASDAQ taking a fat dump. I bought a decent lot of April 10C contracts at open yesterday that I am up over 150% on already, but I am holding for a possible five to ten bagger here. Still accumulating shares at this level as well. A lot of upside potential here in my opinion. My near term price target is $15 by early 2021. $20 would then be my likely exit point on all of my calls (unless I am feeling greedy, which happens way too often, so probably....).

TL;DR: digital ad space, microsof contractst, Cathie and ARK, analyst buy ratings up the ying yang. I'm in for 40 contracts of April 10C.

Title: $FCX  is a boomer battleship, but its full-steam ahead!  
$FCX is the next big play. Heres why:

Investors are piling into wagers on industrial metals like copper and nickel, betting that coronavirus vaccines and stimulus programs will drive a boom in manufacturing activity as part of a global economic resurgence.

Prices for copper have risen to their highest level in almost eight years. Iron ore, the main ingredient of steel, is one of the best-performing assets in 2020.

And shares of metals producers, including Freeport-McMoRan Inc. ($FCX) are on a tear, climbing alongside other stocks closely tied to economic growth.

As opposed to precious metals like gold, which serve primarily as a store of value, industrial metals actually have utility. Metals like copper are used in real estate construction, automobiles and other manufactured goods.

$FCX is one of the largest copper mining firms in the world, and one of the few that are American... this could prove important should tensions between USA-China escalate and government tariffs be applied to foreign producers/sellers of copper material.

166 contracts exp 2/19/21 @ $26 strike... this is the way, fellow autists  see you in Valhalla!

Title: Will SNOW lock-up expiration in december/early jan cause a 25%+ sell off?

[https://sec.report/Document/0001628280-20-013518/](https://sec.report/Document/0001628280-20-013518/)

From what I gather the SNOW S-1 filing was officially submitted on sept 14th, and the 91st day from this is Monday Dec 14th. Another website I found confirmed this. SNOW insiders can then sell about 3 million shares or \~10% of the float, so maybe just a small dip happens then, but the next one they can sell \~9 million shares or \~25% of the float which could be a great short opportunity.

**"The second trading day immediately following the day that the closing price of our Class A common stock on The New York Stock Exchange exceeds 133% of the initial public offering price as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, for at least 10 trading days in the 15 trading day period following the 90th day after the date of this prospectus."**

Confusing enough for ya? It only took me a few hours to work this out..

Initial public offering price appears to be $245, and 133% of this is $325.85, which SNOW can likely hold above.

The 90th day is dec 13th + 10 trading days above $325.85 + 2 days = thursday dec 31st liquidation occurs? (christmas is not a trading day, but christmas eve counts as a day I believe, even tho it is technically a half day).

This correct? I think these f\*cks intentionally worded it this way to keep the public from realizing what day they can legally sell to prevent a panic sell off. 

Idk about you, but if I had 30,000+ shares at $6.78 average, I'd definitely be taking the full 25% profit allowable on dec 31st at $371/share **(5400% unrealized gain)**. I hope this post saves a few retail investors that bought in not knowing this 

Also, SNOW has 184x price to sales ratio and buffet bought in at $100. 

SNOW jan bear put spreads and short shares.

**What we know**

1.	[Reported loss of 53 cents vs loss of 85 cents expected. Revenue 1.0B vs 1.09B expected.](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/gamestop-gme-falls-despite-narrower-144802231.html)

3.	No mention of Cohen or Microsoft Deal.

Just want to let people know that that 100m dollars (**NOT SHARES**) in dilution is just an option. Management put it out there either to make some $ when this short squeeze and/or to fend off Cohen for a bit. If you listen on the conference call.

\*No, that's absolutely not the intent. The intent here is to simply optimize flexibility and optionality. Period. There is a lot of unknowns going on in the marketplace with respect to this pandemic, ongoing flex of cases across the world, the impacts on our own businesses.

And we're not immune to that, right? And, in that regard, look, we're going to continue to execute our strategies that have bolstered and strengthen our balance sheet. And you see all the work that we've done, including, if we go back to even the long-term debt levels in early 2019 until today, it's -- you know, as of this coming Friday will have reduced our long-term debt over $530 million, by March of '21, they'll be over $600 million. In that same timeframe, that same roughly 24-month timeframe, plus or minus, we also returned over $200 million to shareholders. So, I think -- look, the goal is to continue to focus on running the business and optimizing we run the business, but also be very pragmatic and make sure that we have capital flexibility with no intention to do anything other than maintain our flexibility.

Title: ARKG at a discount
**not financial advice, invest at your own risk, pay your rent first**

Fellow Autists.  Monday there was a post about ARKG options and by the time most people realized it the premiums for calls got pretty high due to some weekend news from the almighty $CRSP.  There's a couple of underlying stocks that have been hammered yesterday and today, specifically $ARCT which announced a new stock offering.  Combined with today's stall on stimulus there's been a pretty sharp decline in the January call premium which I expect to correct in the next couple days.  Even with today's hit on pricing I expect it to rise by Jan 15 call date.

I've been tracking trailing 1, 3, 6 month average daily changes for ARKG still and believe we could see it hit the $114-$140 mark.  It is up 173% from 6 months ago and 30% from one month ago.  It is averaging a daily change of 1.09% for the prior month, 0.82% for 3 months and 0.59% over the past 6 months.  

In aunt cathie I do abide.

Title: RAVN - Cathie and ARKQ's next Baby
Alright you degens, here's the deal. Raven Industries is a small-cap [(but over $1 Billion market capitalization currently)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RAVN/). Their highest market cap range was $1.75B in [September of 2018](https://ycharts.com/companies/RAVN/market_cap), with a huge dip due to the 'rona. So mods, don't think I missed the submission rules.

**What Raven Industries Do**

"Applied Technology" aka fancy tech for farmers. Field computers, guidance/steering, machine control, yada yada. Anything to get Jebediah out of his tractor and behind a tablet.

"Engineered Films" - you need a big blanket to cover up an entire pond, but specifically made to protect the environment from hydrocarbon contaminants? You get Absolute Barrier Y30BAC, and you get a pond sized liner in a week.

"Aerostar" - This is the big one. Raven provides quick deployment balloon systems for everything from surveillance and communication systems to monitoring atmospheric conditions. NASA loves these and so does Alphabet/Google [(check out Project Loon)](https://loon.com/), both current Raven customers. They're pretty much satellites you can deploy from the ground that can smell your last FD's rotting corpse from [19 miles high.](https://ravenaerostar.com/aerospace-and-defense/scientific-research)

**WHY YOU ARE BEING SPOON FED ABOUT THIS STOCK**

Our lord and savior, Cathie Wood and ARKQ has [initiated a position on RAVN.](https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/20/12/18582800/raven-industries-small-cap-agriculture-balloon-technology-stock-cathie-wood-likes) Moreover, they have since increased their stake from an initial $5 million to a current stake of around [$12 million in 2 months.](https://cathiesark.com/arkq-holdings-of-ravn) That's what prompted me to take a look at some of Raven's performance.

**PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO COMPETITORS**

Pulling data from Fidelity's Key Statistics derived from Raven's latest Edgar filings, Raven has some interesting metrics:

Gross Margin (Most Recent Qtr, Annualized): RAVN 40.27%, Avg Industrial Conglomerates 38.06%, putting them in the 75th percentile of Industrials. Solid but not mind blowing.

Return on Equity (Most Recent Qtr, Annualized): RAVN 10.65%, Avg Industrial Conglomerates 11.75%, putting them in the 50th percentile of Industrials. Middle of the pack.

Return on Assets (Most Recent Qtr, Annualized): RAVN 8.56%, Avg sector is 3.98%, putting them in the 92nd percentile. Now we're talking.

According to the [Nov 24 earnings report](https://investors.ravenind.com/news-releases/news-release-details/raven-industries-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2021), the applied technology and Aerostar segments saw an increased revenue of 22% and 15% year over year respectively. Tractors go brr, balloons go prrrrt.

Total Debt/Capital (Most Recent Qtr, Annualized): 3.03%, avg of sector is 57.13%. It has *extremely* low debt obligations relative to other industrials. Now normally this is where you say that they're idiots because they're not properly leveraging. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a lot of bourbon since I started writing this post, so I'll leave with this. I am bullish with 300 shares and 10 calls at varying strikes for May 2021 (furthest out I could go). The current options sentiment is massively bullish. I'm talking Call/Put ratio of 434:1 for today's volume, open interest C:P is 27:1. For the smoother of brains out here, that means that we can't have a bear hunting season, because thus far we cannot determine whether bears even exist.

&amp;#x200B;

Cathie is love, ARK is life. Following her till the day I die.

During the pandemic, lots of better players entered this market. Due to the vaccine, their revenue is not foreseen to grow and the stock is becoming decreasingly popular... right now this crap still sits at a market valuation of 110b...

Title: How to capitalize off of retardation: buy $ABB
Listen up you bunch of autistic fucks here's the play. Tomorrow AirBNB is going to IPO under the symbol $ABNB, and its going to fuckin moon like a Russian monkey. But, the MM's and institutional investors are going to be the only ones to gain from this. But, we can capitalize off of the fact that the average investor is a fucking idiot and can't read 4 letters so they'll probably get tickers mixed up. We need to convince people that $ABB is $ABNB. This happened with $ZOOM/ZM and $LAZR/LAZ. We have to go into every investing thread on every sight and convince people to buy $ABB. If we coordinate our autism properly this is literally free tendies being transferred from the retarded to the smrt.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: $ABB 12/18 27 call

Title: Airbnb IPO is cheap at $60/share.
Airbnb (ABNB) is going public tomorrow aiming for a valuation of $42B or $60/share. This is cheap. The bankers are pricing it, as if it is another Uber/Lyft. Whereas in reality is multiple times better as it can become a high margin business. **Price target: $150/share**. Let me explain why.

# Unique supply

The long-tail of Airbnb hosts tends to be lazy and only list their properties on Airbnb. Which is great as it makes it a must visit platform for guests. This contrary to Uber/Lyft where all drivers/customers are on both and pricing is all that matters for the consumer.

This is firstly driven by the above mentioned unique content offering. Secondly it is driven by Airbnbs focus on user experience. Basically making the platform pleasant to use. Which results in an Airbnb you want to use, and a booking.com which you have to use because the algos make you. This brings potential for margin expansion because you dont have to grow marketing spend in order to grow revenue (decoupling these = extra profit margin!).

# Margin expansion

Even though above characteristics should make it relatively easy to turn a decent profit for Airbnb, they have historically mainly written losses. Currently they blow all the margin on refunds, too many developers, and an expensive office in SF, etc. Yet, if during the next 10 years they focus on the bottom line it could become a great 30-40% margin business. This would bring it in line with marketplaces that enjoy similar 'winner takes most' characteristics such as horizontal classifieds and property platforms. Details below on the potential costs as % of revenue.

|*Component*|*Airbnb 2020*|*Booking 2020*|*Airbnb 2030*|*Logic*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Operations, support, refunds,|40%|10%|23%|Stop being overly nice to customers and giving everyone refunds.|

Title: Why the Market is becoming the Economy: A Tale of Two Liquidities (SPY, stimulus, repos)
This is super long, so if you don't wanna read it skip to the TLDR.  This also isn't a revolutionary thesis, "we need stimmy!" but I wanted to breakdown why it's important, at least in my view.

**Long story short:** the importance of this year's booming rally has largely hinged on: a)increased liquidity through FED repo lending mechanisms and b) dramatically increased consumer opportunities created by enhanced UI benefits, and where people chose to spend it.

**1) The rise and fall of FED liquidity via short term loans**

For those who were around in the halcyon days of the late spring and early summer, we witnessed SPY do some amazing things together. For review, I noted two specific mechanisms that were largely behind the barrage of green dildos raining down daily:

1a.) *Free money repo operations:* to simplify it, this is the process by which financial entities borrow money from each other for overnight asset purchases; it's a closed, short term loan ecosystem. This became a bloated and expensive process in 2019, leading to somewhat of a mini-crisis, and the FED stepped in to offer their own low interest short-term loans. When the March crash came, the FED sent this lending vehicle into hyperdrive, throwing hundreds of billions of dollars a week into low interest short-term loan operations for banks. How low?

**Free. They were offering overnight swaps with banks, using treasury as collateral, and charging ZERO additional interest on them.**

(photo of Repo operation details)--you see, IOER plus ZERO BASIS POINTS. *Literally, free money.*

Since the Spring, SPY has petered out.  Up and down, boomer-esque gains have replaced the BTD logic of summer.  Below is the difference in price and percent for the first trading day in each month compared to the last. Things got shaky in the fall. (note that it is typically assumed that FED balance sheet adjustments take about one-two months to show results, good or bad)

May to June: 280.43/303 = **8%**
June to july: 303/ 309.28= 2% (note below)
July to August (3) = 309.28/ 328.74= **6.2%**
August to September= 328.74/ 351.19= **6.8%**
September to October = 351.19/ 337.04= **-4.19%**
October to November = 337.04/ 330.20= **2%**
November to December= 330.20/ 366.02= 10.84% (note below)
**The 3 days preceding and following the election were responsible for 7.3% of the November rise, so Nov is something of an outlier. The 2% in June came due to the crash, which was caused by the very thing I'm solidifying--a change in the Fed overnight loan terms)

Also since the Spring, the amount of people participating in overnight Repo operations has petered out. Why? Because it's not longer free money. **The FED's bread and butter liquidity operation for short term loans changed their interest terms. This is so important that it was the largest catalyst for the June crash. Stories broke on the 10th and 11th that the Fed would be "tweaking" the overnight lending rates, from the "free money" 0 points over IOER to 5 points over on the overnight, and 10 points on the term.** Do the math; if the story breaks on the 11th stating the FED would be increasing the rate on their overnight loan operations, and the Street catches wind likely a day or two before that...what do you think causes the crash on the 11th? The FED program has been steadily increasing to a standard +10 interest charge.

So, the FED has dried up it's free money overnight lending, an it would seem to coincide with SPY slowing down.

1b.) The end of double pump Tuesdays
Once upon a time I wrote about the "Double Pump"--typically on Tuesday--when the FED would offer both term AND overnight repo operations on the same day, at the IOER +0 (free money) rate. However, once the interest rate climbed to +5 points it became obsolete; it's more common to see zero takers on repo/reverse repo operations than it is to see more than one taker, nowadays. Tuesdays were guaranteed green at a 90% rate--and then FED lending practices changed, and poof.

The details of all this shit is boring, but the point is this: once the COVID crash hit, in order to grease the wheels to getting the market back on track the FED was employing multiple avenues to give financial entities money to play with mostly via its absurdly low-cost loan swap programs.


These repo lending programs becoming more expensive are apart of a larger general trend; the shrinking FED balance sheet. Although in recent months they have lightly picked spending back up, we have flatlined from the huge jump we saw in March and April in response to the pandemic.

[photo] look at that level-off, this shit matter

**2) Stimulus play money go bye-bye**
Stimmy pumps aren't much, unless you're betting 0DTE, but the underlying importance of an economic stimulus that benefits consumers is. There are three simple measures signifying it's importance as a liquidity pump:

2a.) Consumer spending: when the stimulus began to hit in April/May, we saw a huge jump in consumer spending. You remember the lines at WMT and TGT and shit. In June, for example, consumer spending was expected to increase a little less than 2%--it went higher than 6%.

2b.) Credit Card Debt begone: people had so much extra money from the stimulus they paid off their credit cards https://www.wsj.com/articles/consumers-flush-with-stimulus-money-shun-credit-card-debt-11596373201 . This is a clear indication that the stimulus funds were having a positive spending affect.

2c.) Consumer choices: Used auto sales and home sales skyrocketed (link), indicating people were flush with excess cash for down payments, in addition to the ability to pay off debt.
https://www.wsj.com/articles/during-covid-19-pandemic-the-used-car-lot-is-hot-11593774001

**Conclusion**
So what the fuck am I saying? I'm saying that in order for the market to not reflect and react to current (horrid) employment and opportunity metrics--common measures of economic health being decimated by the COVID/lockdown return-- one of these two external liquidity injections must continue; FED balance sheet ultra expansion, or stimulus injection. While FED spending on QE is increasing slightly over the past few months, it's paltry in comparison March, April, and May, and is very unlikely to return to those levels. This is why in every speaking engagement Powell makes it clear: we need a stimulus.

So, the answer to which liquidity injection can continue is the stimulus. Specifically, the enhanced unemployment benefits that, coupled with eviction moratoriums and rent/mortgage deferment, allow consumer spending and credit debt relief on a mass scale. Regardless of the bickering, it is going to happen. The enhanced UI will happen, in particular, because more widespread lockdowns are going to hurt jobs numbers, thus lending the Dems the leverage they need. UI benefits are tied to employment, and even McConnell is acknowledging there is no way around that.

**I see a lot of people talking about the stimulus in the daily thread, so here are some basics:**
1) Direct payments are likely not happening this time, or at a depressed level (talk of $600)
2) UI enhancements will be reinstated at at least $300 extra weekly, backdated to June 1st
3) There will be another eviction moratorium extension, probably for 3, 4 months
4) It doesn't matter what the white house wants--the chain of approval goes House vote (Nancy), then Senate vote (McConnell). Any vote in either house that hasn't been supported by the other chamber is DOA and pure political stunt.
5) The big hangup is corporate liability protection for Democrats (businesses, schools, hospitals want lawsuit immunity from COVID cases) and State and Local Government Aid for the Democrats (money to be used at the discretion of localities, including social programming, policing, education).
6) Its going to pass this negotiation cycle because it's tied to a government shutdown.


Positions: Arming for the next round of stimulus


SPY: stay away, honestly. Even after the initial pump, there will still be several rounds of voting needed, between committees and chambers, each with it's own bad news cycle days and good news cycle days.


I'm also staying away from small cap trash and looking at companies who most benefit from restriction rules, integrated online systems well, or both. I had a good sense this dip was coming yesterday, so I'm loading up on these at EOD:


Strong retail:
WMT: 1/8 155c
TGT: 1/8 180c


Consumer electronics that boomed in lockdown 1:
AAPL: 1/8 126c
HPQ: 1/15 25c
Once people realize that telehealth is here to stay, TDOC merger is actually dope as fuck, and vaccine logistics are going to take forever:
TDOC 11/24 200c
TDOC 1/15 205c
I just fucking like TOL, so 
TOL 1/15 46c

TLDR: To stave off a bear market reflecting wider economic conditions, we need a continuation of either 0 interest FED short-term loan programs or an economic stimulus--stimulus is more likely. SPY, without these two things, has shown waning strength over the past few months. Buy calls like the stimulus is coming in the next few weeks, but stay away from SPY generally and pick consumer-spending winners with dual in-person/online presence.

*If I find interesting stimulus news I'll put it in updates here. If I ditch a position I'll update why here, if it's quick news or moves I try to update on twitter--YourBoyMilt-- people got super mad one time about updates not notifying on here, so yeah.  Not my fault, mods*

Title: Ford DD inside
Ive been watching a lot of TV recently and Ford has adopted the slogan Ford, built for the holidays. The holidays are coming up and I think Ford is putting all of there eggs in the holiday basket.

The Google-Fitbit merger has been on hold for about a year because of the EU regulatory body. Supposed to be approved as soon as this week. Options are crazy cheap rn. My position is 8c 1/15/21. Anyone else in on this?

Title: they all sold TSLA to buy DASH, and they'll do it again tmrw
looks to me like TSLA falling off today is 100% because weak hands sold their TSLA to buy DASH, when ABNB starts trading tmrw its guaranteed to do it again.  im buying a gang of 12/11 600Ps

Title: Get Rich with this Strategy.Min Profit of 600 and Max profit of 1100 for each spread
Boomers if you are tired of losing money in Options,I found a IV skew between calls and Puts for QS stock.IV on puts for QS is damn high while the IV on calls is too low for this stock.This is the strategy I am playing.

QS - Jan 15 2021

Sell 75 Put,Buy 45 Put - Net credit 2300,Collateral 3000

Sell 50 Call,Buy 75 call - Net Credit 1300,No need of collateral since it is covered from credit put

Effectively you will be getting a credit of 3600 with 3000 collateral. You can pocket 600 free money and if stock expires above 50 you will make additional 500 due to the call leg.QS is in EV hype zone and its shorted too much and with the good news yesterday the stock has some upside with both short squeeze coming and fundamental play.Even if the stock crashes and goes to zero you end making 600$ profit. So this is it guys get richer and treat me and if anyone finds a loophole in this strategy let me know.I am balls deep in this.

One risk is getting the 50 call assigned and with this volatility its not gonna happen.Even if the call gets assigned we can quickly close the stocks and 75 call leg and end up making more than 1100$ for each contract

I did 300 contracts of them in multiple accounts.Screenshot attached

Title: RMG is NKLA 2.0
First time poster here bug a big fan of WSB, and I think I've found the next electric vehicle unicorn.

RMG has doubled in the last 3 weeks on minimal press. I think the take off will continue.

\-SPAC of Romeo Power. SPAC team that took Romeo power public (and is existing management team) is comprised of GS and Evercore heavweights.

\-Strategic partnership with BorgWarner (an early investor in RMG). BorgWarner is a $10BN market cap automotive supplier in the United States. Similar to the NKLA/General Motors partnership which fell apart... but very much existed when NKLA went from $10-&gt;$60.

\- They already have $800MM in revenue secured through long term contracts, of which $234MM they announced two weeks ago.

\- They have a completed 117M SF facility in California for creating lithium batteries specifically for Class 8 Commercial trucks. Everything from testing, and every element of assembly, will be done in-house. This is a differentiator from competitors. Class 8 EV truck's are presently 8% of the market, projected to go to mid-20% electric by 2025.

\-Per their investor deck, the battery provides more energy density than competitors.

\- Massive EV/Revenue discount when compared to NKLA based off respective 3 year projections.

This is going to move just as NKLA did from April-July.. or higher.

Title: APHA to the moon
Alright my fellow bulls, how is APHA not more talked about? I got in at $6.77 and I'm holding for a longgg time. First of all, it's the best weed stock imo. Better than ACB, better than anything else. They acquired one of the largest independent craft brewers in the US recently giving them access to the US market. Plus, we're legalizing marijuana in a lot of places and Aphria has been increasing it's revenue consistently and has 14% of the Canadian pot market and has access to almost 70% of pharmacies in Germany through its acquisition of CC Pharma. Plus, unlike other weed stocks like ACB, Aphria isn't burning through its capital and it's super profitable. Right now, it's at $8.20. Let's get it to $420

TLDR: APHA to the moon 

Title:  C3.AI is the real gold here ya'll but not at the current price 
Fk [C3.Ai](https://C3.Ai) with such retarded opening i really hope that it crashes and burns after the hype so we all can pick it up cheap. At this point im not expecting any ipos to be cheap just purely based on the hype were seeing right now. But here is just a DD i did for it. The company has **an interesting business model in which that the company will partner up with another company to create an application that is proven to increase efficiency, reduce cost, track measurements for analysis purposes and so on and will then proceed to sell the same implementation to other companies that may benefit from the applications**. The revenue is mainly based on the subscription models to create steady stream of revenue. The company is lead by Tom Siebel, the pioneer of the customer relationship management software business that sold his company to Oracle for 6 billion in 2006 and C3.AI is his next level creation to revolutionize the world. **C3.AI is listed as one of the top disruptors of 2020 is backed up by Microsoft and spring creek capital with 50 million of stocks and $ 100 million investment respectively. C3.AI announced the partnership with Raytheon Technologies to develop AI solutions for aerospace and defense missions for government customers, including the U.S. Air Force and intelligence community. They also announced partnership with Microsoft and Adobe for a new customer  relationship management software seeking to comeback Salesforce INC.** The potential **for C3.AI is limitless because of how broad the scope can be. With a successful implementation of an application, C3.AI could easily spin it off to implement such applications to other industries with incredible scalability and tremendous reduction to developing cost**. Before we dive into what the company actually does, here is the overview of the company. 

**Financial wise, the company has**

\- **A whopping 71% yoy growth**

\- **86% subscription revenue**

\- **A $271 billion TAM by 2024.** 

\- **Narrowing income loss thanks to the rapid growth**

**The AI technology is a proven technology and is one that is being used daily to help industries moving faster into digital transformation. The currently capability and usage of the AI software is as followed** 

\- **Make 1.1Billion predictions per day**

\- **Has 4.8million machine learning models in production use**

\- **Has 622 million sensors generating data for the C3.AI suite**

\- **Has 770 unique enterprise and extraprise source data integration** 

\- **Has 50 Million businesses and consumers touched daily**

**Notable market successes:**

\- **Banks are able to enhance securities lending optimization with estimated value of 14 billion in additional daily trades deployed in 52 weeks**

\- **Healthcare managements are able to enhance production optimization with estimated value of 300% increase in unit production deployed in 4 weeks**

\- **Oil and gas companies are able to predictive maintenance for offshore oil rigs and is able to recapture $28million per year in avoided shutdowns** 

What is C3.AI

C3.ai is an enterprise AI software company that provides software as a service, applications that enable the rapid deployment of enterprise AI applications of extraordinary scale and complexity that offer significant social and economic benefit. 

**Two primary software solutions:**

**1.** **C3 AI suite: designed to allow customers to apply design, develop, and deploy enterprise AI application to any type (basically a platform that allows you to develop your own applications)**

**2.** **C3 AI Application: include a large and growing family of industry specific and application specific turnkey Ai solutions that can be immediately installed and deployed (a prebuilt application that is ready to go for implementations)**

The market entry growth strategy of C3.AI is focus on partnering and coordinating with lighthouse customers (the big companies including AWS, Baker Huges, FIS, Google, IBM and Microsoft) to create a proven and scalable applications that work to increase efficiency, cut down on costs and to record measurements on a massive scale for analysis purposes. With the established applications. 

**C3.AI is then able to** 

**1.** **Expand those same use cases across similar companies**

**2.** **Establish middle market sales organizations, including tele sales, and online sales**

**3.** **Leverage on marketing partners as enterprise and mid-market distribution channels**

Real world user case:

Engie  largest power producer in the world with

\- 114.4 GW power production capacity

\- $67 billion annual revenue in europoors money

\- 153k employees, operated in 70 counties 

With the partnership with Engie, C3.Ai developed and deployed performance optimization for gas power plants, efficiency optimization of heating and cooling plants, energy analysis and management for enterprise and consumer customers, and anomaly detection of wind turbines. **C3 was able to bring the scalability required to build industrial AI based application with over 1million sensors, 5 million end points and 17mil measurements per day with the end result of bringing estimated 1.5 billion in annual economic benefits**

\- Wind turbines with in 12 weeks of deployment sees 2-3% increase in performance resulting in 15-22Mil annual economic value

\- Heating and cooling plants see 2-3% saving in energy consumption costs with $3mil annual economic value

\- Application in analyze energy for metered facility on the Ohio State university campus and is expected to see 25% energy saving within 10 years within 16 weeks of deployment 

\- Application to analyze and forecast consumption for electricity and gas retail customers in France of 2.6Mil electricity consumers and 8.6mil has consumers with deployment of 6 months 

**Revenue model**

\- **Term subscriptions of the C3.AI Suite**

\- **Term subscriptions of C3.AI applications**

\- **Monthly runtime fee of C3 AI Applications and customer-developed application built using the C3.AI suite, usage based upon CPU- hour consumption**

\- **Professional services fees associated with training and assisting customers**

In the case of Engie, C3.AI would be making money from subscriptions to C3.AI suite and applications, setting up required trackers for measurements, developing AI applications, a monthly runtime fee if Engie is continuing to develop new applications with C3.AI. With the proven applications and set up, C3.AI then would be able to sell them to other companies that could also benefit from same implementation. **With Biden focusing on green energy infrastructures, one could expect the demand of the applications to increase.**

Their AI has also been used in sectors like utilities, banking, aerospace &amp; defense, healthcare, retail, telecommunications, smart cities, and transportation. **With already proven and prebuilt applications listed below that could be implemented into broader and more general sector.** 

\- **Anti-money laundering**

\- **COVID-19 Data lake**

\- **AI CRM**

\- **Energy management**

\- **Fraud detection**

\- **Inventory optimization**

\- **Predictive maintenance**

\- **Production schedule optimization**

\- **Readiness**

\- **Sensor health**

\- **Supply network risk** 

**As C3.Ai continues to work with various more different sectors to create more applications, C3.AI will be able to reach into more boarder market. With already established applications in various broad sectors, C3.AI is going to take AI to the next level by focusing on deep penetration into business solutions, aerospace and defense with the partnership with Microsoft, Adobe and Raytheon Technologies to fully dominate the sectors.** 

 **TLDR:** 

**There is none cause im too lazy to type one.**

Title: Get out of meal delivery, buy grocery delivery
Fuck meal delivery. Prices are awful and unsustainable--buying for delivery by the meal is not an option for a lot of young people which are their biggest market. And have you ever heard a boomer wanting to order food from something like DoorDash? The profits are falling and if their wages fall, no one will want to touch this industry. You already see this service being automated and that will only continue.

Grocery delivery on the other hand has seen a big increase during COVID, and that looks like its here to stay for the most part. Grocery delivery makes more sense: do it once or twice a month, very convenient, lots of competition between third parties (instacart, shipt, etc.) and proprietary services (Walmart Plus). There is also more room to grow with companies easily integrating it into their service like Amazon with Amazon Prime Now.

Pay attention to the social and technological trends here.

Title: You could be DIRECTLY profiting off a global pandemic! (PFE) 
Hello fellow tards of WSB. I know most of you are extremely busy throwing your rent at meme stocks such as NIO, PLTR, GME, and BB but take a look at [this.](https://imgur.com/gallery/QLmMLqc)

I have been following Pfizer (PFE) closely since the announcement was made that they are working on the COVID vaccine. You know, the one that shook the stock market to its core at the beginning of this year? Yes that one. Since the initial announcement the stock has steadily risen, with an occasional dip during a lull.

Well just in the last couple days a few countries have received their first shipments of the vaccine and since then, **Pfizers stock has entered its first dip**. That means its **cheap** now and could *easily*  in the following weeks as COVID cases decrease. 

My guess is PFE @ $45+ by end of week.

Title: BCRX 22% Short squeeze, it's fucking real, loaded, and the margin calls are beginning today.
Position: BCRX 12/18 5C's 12/18 10C's

Shorts and bears bet big on this company  (Biocryst pharmaceuticals) hoping it would fail in 1-2 ways; not getting their FDA approval, or having to dilute their shares in order to get more cash to keep operating.   

**Shorts really fucked up though; because they didn't get just 1 wrong, they got both bets wrong and now 22% of the float on loan are trapped in short positions are underwater.**  

To make it worse for these shorts, they haven't begun to cover their positions but...  Japan may weigh in and give it's approval for the drug any day now.    Tutes/Hedge fund data accessed from here... ([https://fintel.io/so/us/bcrx](https://fintel.io/so/us/bcrx))

&amp;#x200B;

They really fucked up though because not only did they get FDA approval for their drug, they got 350 million in non-dilutive funding.  They have \~ 475 million in cash access and a pill form for a medical condition which previously required people to self inject medications, it was awful but people did it to stay alive/safer.  This company now has a single pill a day to treat this condition known as HAE.  Here's what it used to look like for everyone in the world...

Now it's a single pill a day worldwide because of Biocryst.  That's a huge improvement for Quality of life for these people.

That is a 2.63X for the missing Q4

Title: Atari is entering a new era
 

We all know Atari. At least anyone older 35 y/o but also the younger   generation that has heard about the iconic company. They went through   very turbulent times and filed for bankruptcy and changed many owners   but here they are and with the original founder on the company board.   They have a lot of stuff going for them too.

## VCS console

This is a gaming console / PC hybrid that has an AMD **Ryzen** processor   in it (best in class currently). They are taking right now pre-orders   and will launch soon. There arent make big name gaming consoles on the   market right now. PS5 made Sonys stock explode recently. The PC  hybrid  is a great idea because you essentially have a full blown PC  that can  connect to a 4K home TV and makes a great present. The kids  can play [Roblox ](https://loftfinancial.com/the-kids-in-the-block-sandbox-like-roblox/) and have zoom school lessons at the same time.

## Atari Hotels

This  is a crazy idea which I like a lot. There are many things going  on  simultaneously at this period. First of all we got a glimpse of the   future with [**Ready Player One**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1677720/) which featured prominently the Atari brand. Secondly, [**Cyberpunk 2077**](https://www.cyberpunk.net/)   is going to be the hit of the year in gaming and although its not   directly related to Atari it depicts a dystopian 80s atmosphere in which   **Atari is king**. Capitalizing on this, Atari is opening a hotel chain which is an immesrive experience of gaming and **AR/VR**   with the first one being in **Las Vegas**, the best location in the world   for this type of stuff. This will probably not be hit by the Covid   pandemic because it will open up just when people will start travelling   again. **If this takes off it can be a huge hotel chain/experience worldwide.**

## Atari Token

Atari recently released a [token ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/atari-token/)that will be used for intra-game purchased, player rewards, ecosystem engagement and many other used canses much like [Enjin ](https://enjin.io/)and   Dapper labs Flow. This only adds to the rise of this company. This is   also a good time for the dip because since its IEO the token is  trading  down 80% of the original price in dollar terms which admittedly  was  overpriced.

## The stock

Has taken a recent dip trading  today at -22% of the recent high and  sits only at 100M market cap  which is a steal for these kind of  prospects.

Title: PLTR at these Valuations
TL;DR: My admittedly slightly  on PLTR at these prices. Wait for a dip.

**My play on PLTR**

I'd really like to see a pullback to \~25 (or lower ideally) ... then I would load up on calls, shares, and sell a bunch of put credit spreads. I like PLTR, but I hate these valuations... it may be I don't know enough about the company, but I have friends who work with it in DC. The problem is that the software platform requires heavy customization for every client... this is a big scaling issue..and I cannot find any data on how PLTR plans to scale to justify valuations at the SNOW level (which is where this thing would need to go to be a huge money-maker at these prices).

**The major problems I see with PLTR are:**

* Highly dependent on govts. Palantir has to be careful with profits so that it doesn't reek of perceived abuse (irrespective of actual value). They risk inquiries, GAO (Government Audit Office) audits, downsizing, and potential cancellations depending on the internal pressure. I believe this is why they are angling for surveillance, etc as those contracts are less transparent by nature, which mitigates this challenge some
* Customizations - makes it tough to scale big time a la SNOW

**The good:**

* Rockstar management and backing
* Super-compelling offering with what is to be the major problems at govts/corps (parsing signal from noise in the data due to data overload)
* Should be majorly profitable

**Summary**

I like PLTR. I am a bit wary at these prices, since it's tough to gauge if this is a pure SaaS or a consulting company. Given Thiel's involvement, and heavy insistence on platform plays, I am inclined for this to be the former. I'd like to see a bit of pullback first and IV to come down. In the meantime, selling weekly puts to take advantage of the sky high IV.

Any other insights? Anything I missed and should be added?

Title: Pfizer Play
Listen you dirty bastards Im dropping a very simple DD.

Pfizer is about to get some major hype. Hell it was all over the news last night, you know boomers love nothing more than CNN and other channels sucking a company. 

They are 1 week ahead of moderna yet havent spiked like moderna. 

Now why do you care? Because youre a fellow retard. Simply put this stock has great hype potential this week. Thursday they go in for official approval. They say this is a 1-3 day process but hell we already know its about to be approved as soon as it hits the table. Dont believe me? 
Heres some proof: https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/12/08/944286693/fda-head-stephen-hahn-on-whats-next-for-pfizer-vaccine-in-fast-moving-process

Ok so whats this mean? Pfizer is the next meme stock? Next big moon? Next 10 bagger. No no and no. This means its a quick fucking play for us autists to make tendies this week to move on next week with a strong hand. 

The options have good prices with good delta and decent theta &lt; trick cuz you shouldnt be scared of theta since this is a QUICK PLAY. 

TLDR: QUICK PLAY, VACCINE HYPE, DUE FOR PUMP, I REITERATE QUICK PLAY DO NOR HOLD PAST THIS WEEK IF YOU DONT BITCH. 

Current positions: dont have any but I plan on purchasing x amount of 45c 12/11 cuz Im crazy (also cuz I day trade options so not concerned at all with theta) 

Disclaimer: not investment advice, not a pump a dump just following market trend. Hell dont even own a position yet lol.

Title: $PEN, Valeant level fraud. The big short.
The Jet 7 Xtra Flex catheter from Penumbra has killed more patients than all of its competitors... COMBINED. On top of that management has refused to recall, and it has been shown that management created the false identity "Antik Bose" to publish research confirming the device's safety. This research was used in premarket approval for the catheter.

Steven Brooks, with 6 years experience in the FDA Office of Device Evaluation predicts a class 1 recall with material effect on revenues: [https://www.qcmfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Formal-assessment-on-Penumbra.pdf](https://www.qcmfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Formal-assessment-on-Penumbra.pdf)

Report Part 2 (Elaborate research fraud): [http://www.qcmfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/QCM-on-Antik-Bose-Final.pdf](http://www.qcmfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/QCM-on-Antik-Bose-Final.pdf)

Not included in the reports:

After Antik Bose was exposed as a false identity over 5 of his social profiles were deleted. The timing of this eliminates the possibility that the false identity was not created by Penumbra management.

The company did not issue a press release in response to the first report in response to deaths, but after Antik Bose was exposed, we received this little gem from the CEO:

This attack by sleazy short sellers QCM reads like an internet conspiracy written by teenagers. It is impossible to dispute the facts, because there are no facts.

Why no press release on the first report in response to deaths, but they want to respond like this to the second report? This company is going to the shitter.

Price target is 50$, do your own research.

Title: TSLA S&amp;P Purchase Chart - 73B in TSLA purchased around 12/18 - Where will it come from? Is it possible? At what cost?
All funds, ETFs, etc that directly track the S and P have to buy TSLA on or around the 18th. The majority will be purchased directly on the 18th. almost **15% of TSLA Float** will be bought on or around the 18th. Locking it up for as long as it is in the S and P.

**Can They Buy Enough TSLA on 12/18?**

When only counting S&amp;P and tracking index funds / ETFs, at current Tesla Price, they are scheduled to purchase **$73 Billion in TSLA.**

This gets progressively larger, as the price increases.

[TSLA Price Changes Changes S and P inclusion purchasing](https://preview.redd.it/qsv4203674461.jpg?width=741&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=deebe56d8351bcd988ac5698ae07ddf8c86b1d87)

They have to buy 113+ Million shares, or about **15% of all available shares.**

**How are they going to do it?**

1. **Institutional Investors - 52.96%** [Institutional investors](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=TSLA&amp;subView=institutional) Hold 402M Shares
2. **ETFs - 4.6%** \- 35M Shares. These aren't for sale. Example QQQ owns 10M shares - [165 ETFs that control 17B of TSLA](https://www.etf.com/stock/TSLA)
3. **Retail Investors - 42.4% -** The rest I assume.

**What percent of this TSLA can actually be traded on or about the 18th?**

**ETFs can't sell** their shares, they are tracking something, they just can't sell TSLA.

I believe less then **20% of the retail investor shares will be available.** The rest are held by people that won't even log into an investment account on 12/18 or next week at all. Think of retirement funds, long term investors, etc.

This would mean that **64M** TSLA shares might be available for purchase from retail investors --if the price is right. I don't think these investors are going to liquidate at the current stock price. They are still holding for a reason.

Then there are institutional controlled shares, I believe that a lot of those shares are locked up, think of mutual funds, and investment groups. Baring an emergency they must have meetings and votes on what they trade. It takes weeks or months for many of them to divest in one area and invest in another. They aren't setup to switch strategies at a moments notice, especially for a stock that is having a rally. Also, Think of funds that are filled with just manufacturing or car companies, etc. They won't decide to exclude TSLA for a day / week / month because the price is too high.

Some of the institutional investors have had TSLA for a long time, they have already decided that they want to keep it, and aren't ready to part with it just because it has a high value.

Also look at Capital Group management and Vanguard Fund, together they control about 10% of TSLA (15% of float) and I'm assuming it is intermixed within many of their combined 170 mutual funds they control. I can't imagine that they can divest TSLA from most of the places they have it stashed on one day. Maybe they already have started, but I doubt it.

I think less then  **40%** of the institutional shares will be available on Dec 18th, I think this would be a very 'high' estimate. I also think that the price would have to be North of 750 for these people to think of liquidating. They have TSLA for a reason, and it has done very well for them, a lot of them sold some shares last quarter, and I bet they regret it now.

That would mean **161M** Shares might be available from Institutional Investors, if the price goes astronomical.

**225M Shares actually available on 12/18 (Based on my guesses) - THEY NEED 113M+ and the price will be sky high to get that number.**

I think that it would be very expensive to get 113M shares out of the grips of investors. I think there will be huge profit taking, but I don't think people are going to be willing to liquidate all of their positions. Sell off 10 - 20% sure, but 100% without a 2 -3X increase from the week before seems unlikely, remember, these are **TSLA HOLDERS, they have held for 700% increases this year.**

There is a speed that this has to be done at as well, Even if only 80% has to be done on the 18th, They have to buy **13.9M+ SHARES ( $9B @ 650) PER TRADING HOUR**, if they take an hour off to let the price slow down, they have to **double** it the next hour to keep up with the pace. 3 - 4pm when they are looking at how far they still have to go is going to be a ***B******lood Bath***. Yes some funds can invest a few days before, but it's a small percentage of them, and it still doesn't change the fact that between now and then 113M shares minimum need to be locked away.

Also, think of all the shares that are used as collateral on options. Writing Covered Calls, when the price surges, you probably don't want to liquidate your covered call and sell your shares. They are probably just going to stay tied up, after all, with selling a covered call, you don't benefit from the upward spike in price, your betting the stock will settle down and you get to keep the call premium. TSLA has had immense options activity, and you have to imagine with high Theta, there are a lot of people who enjoy writing covered calls now.

**Wildcard 1: Short sellers**, if there are any TSLA short sellers out there, and IF they can find shares to rent, that aren't sold on the 18th, they could sell short to cover what's needed. But as they watch the stock skyrocket, how willing are they going to be to write those shorts, and if they get liquidated later in the day from a margin call from a skyrocketing stock, those shares have to be replaced from the open market.

I am a little worried about holding 12/18 call debit spreads, I would be worried that they are going to execute the short end early on me to get the shares they need, and making a mess in my account.

**Wildcard 2: Options**, What happens if investment firms start buying options just to exercise them and get the shares? Naked Short Calls will be popped at the worst times, causing market orders to be placed and force buying all over the place. There will be margin calls that require short stocks to be covered, etc. I can see chaotic price increases. 

**Bullets Dodged on this crazy run:** I highly doubt that Tesla will offer another group of stock for sale before the 18th, I believe that this was a signal that this is the only offering they will be making in December, they don't have a history of selling new groups of shares every couple weeks.

The S&amp;P declared that they didn't want to mess up their largest stock addition by doing it in stages. They want it all done on one day.

**Do they care about the price paid? Won't this hurt the S&amp;P? Won't the people in charge refuse to pay the high price?** Not really, They manage an unimaginable amount of money. TSLA is going to make up 1-3% of the S&amp;P, so if they have to overspend by 50-100%, that only effects the index by a percent or two.  The index dropping 2% - its called a Tuesday. TSLA on the short term doesn't effect the index much.

Their biggest concern is properly running the ETF / index. they have to stewardship the index properly.  Not buying at whatever the price is exactly how they announced it would be done weeks ago is the only thing that would hurt their jobs at this point. **THEY WILL BUY AT A FURY PACE ALL DAY. They just have to buy the right amount of shares.** 

**S and P Benchmarked Funds:** There are another **6.6T** in funds that are **Benchmarked** to the S and P, but they are actively traded, and they aren't going to be required to buy shares on the 18th. Some, are already buying shares, those shares will most likely be unavailable for the 18th. This could easily add another **25M - 50M more shares** to be purchased on or around 12/18.

**One last thing to consider:** Remember, There are long term investors all over the planet. Look at this study that says  [ Almost 1% of TSLA is held in S. Korea alone](https://observer.com/2020/08/tesla-stock-fueled-by-korea-retail-investor-apple-microsoft-amazon-tech/#:~:text=As%20of%20Friday%2C%20Korean%20retail,were%20first%20reported%20by%20Bloomberg). How much of that can come home to US indexes on 12/18?  They are asleep for our trading hours.

700C, 800C, 900C, 1000C 12/24

Hell, I'd buy some 1250C for .20 if some fool would write them. ($20 on a long shot of getting it sold at the right time for 2-40k profit)

Edit: My original post mistakenly included the 6.6T in index benchmarked funds to the total S and P tracked funds.

I think there will be huge profit taking, but I don't think people are going to be willing to liquidate all of their positions. Sell off 10 - 20% sure, but 100% without a 2 -3X increase from the week before, remember, these are **TSLA HOLDERS, they have held for 700% increases this year.**

There is a speed that this has to be done at as well, They have to buy **41M+ SHARES ( $26B ) PER TRADING HOUR**, if they take an hour off to let the price slow down, they have to **double** it the next hour to keep up with the pace. 3 - 4pm when they are looking at how far they still have to go is going to be a blood bath.

Also, think of all the shares that are used as collateral on options. Writing Covered Calls, when the price surges, you probably don't want to liquidate your covered call and sell your shares. They are probably just going to stay tied up, after all, with selling a covered call, you don't benefit from the upward spike in price, your betting the stock will settle down and you get to keep the call premium. TSLA has had immense options activity, and you have to imagine with high Theta, there are a lot of people who enjoy writing covered calls now.

**Wildcard: Short sellers**, if there are any TSLA short sellers out there, and IF they can find shares to rent, that aren't sold on the 18th, they could sell short to cover what's needed. But as they watch the stock skyrocket, how willing are they going to be to write those shorts, and if they get liquidated later in the day from a margin call from a skyrocketing stock, those shares have to be replaced from the open market.

I am a little worried about holding 12/18 call debit spreads, I would be worried that they are going to execute the short end early on me to get the shares they need, and making a mess in my account.

**Bullets Dodged on this crazy run:**  
I highly doubt that Tesla will offer another group of stock for sale before the 18th, I believe that this was a signal that this is the only offering they will be making in December, they don't have a history of selling new groups of shares every couple weeks.

The S&amp;P declared that they didn't want to mess up their largest stock addition by doing it in stages. They want it all done on one day.

**Do they care about the price paid? Won't this hurt the S&amp;P? Won't the people in charge refuse to pay the high price?**  
Not really, They manage an unimaginable amount of money. TSLA is going to make up 1-3% of the S&amp;P, so if they have to overspend by 50-100%, that only effects the index by a percent or two.  The index dropping 2% - its called a Tuesday. TSLA on the short term doesn't effect the index much.

Their biggest concern is properly running the ETF / index. they have to stewardship the index properly.  Not buying at whatever the price is exactly how they announced it would be done weeks ago is the only thing that would hurt their jobs at this point. **THEY WILL BUY AT A FURY PACE ALL DAY. They just have to buy the right amount of shares.** Of course, I think they might have a few shares (M) to buy on Monday still, and there will still be index / mutual funds that feel like they have to match the S &amp; P inclusion to not be left behind by the index. They should actually keep the price fairly high all week 12/18 - 12/24

**One last thing to consider:**  
Remember, There are long term investors all over the planet. Look at this study that says  [ Almost 1% of TSLA is held in S. Korea alone](https://observer.com/2020/08/tesla-stock-fueled-by-korea-retail-investor-apple-microsoft-amazon-tech/#:~:text=As%20of%20Friday%2C%20Korean%20retail,were%20first%20reported%20by%20Bloomberg). How much of that can come home on 12/18 - They are asleep for our trading hors.

7/8/900C 12/24  
10/1100C 12/24

I'd buy 1500C for .10 if some fool would write em.

Title: C3.AI is going to moon in the first week of trading: Here's why
Ok so we all agree that c3.ai is a trash company with no future prospects whatsoever. They were slammed right into the ground by the pandemic because only boomer companies used their services. Competing against bost Doordash AND Airbnb on the same day, they should get crushed, right? WRONG.

C3.AI will be getting the "AI" ticker. This means that boomers will have to spell 2 less letters to purchase this stock. AI. It's a catchy ticker. And that's just what it needs for us to make a cozy 20%. Remember the piece of shit pump and dump named ROCKET? It'll be exactly like that. This stock is going to go straight into the moon and the reason is 2 letters short.

Title: Please explain to me why PTON is a $100 stonk (I will explain why it is $hit)
Hi tards,

I believe that PTON is the next 2014 GoPro. If you remember 2014 GoPro was trying to tout thembselves of as a tech company, a social media company, a brand of sorts, and more. I believe they were trying to tell people they were going to also be a drone company. Stonk was soaring. I remember thinking this is just a fucking camera company. All they make is a above average to low premium camera. Why are the large camera companies of the world not crushing them. Well turns out the company was actually valued at around 5 bucks eventually. I believe the same will happen to PTON. It may not go to 5 bucks but I believe it could definitely go to 30-40 dollas by the fibinachi bands. My take is boat loads of people are not going to purchase a 2-4k dollar bike that does not even move. This is during a pandemic where money is supposedly tight. They also have lots of people aggressively fighting for market share aka ... Nordictrack, Mirror thing, Apple, Plain old normal bikes.  

I dont see them as a tech company or a social media company. I see them as a fad excercise equimpement. Half of going to the gym is actually going to the gym. Most people never work out as well at home. This bike will be ridden by my fat wife Becky for a few months then after that it will go in the corner. After a few more months I will trip over it and move it to the garage. After a few more months of pay the subsription I will cancel it. After a year or so my wife even fatter than before will now drag the bike out of the garage for a couple weeks and watch spin class from youtube on her ipad or phone. After a few months the bike will go back in the garage where it will stay for another few years. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; PTON is the shakeweight of stonks. It is a meme in it self. It is what happens when you put 20in rims on your stationary bike and bolt on a 50in Plasma. There is only one direction for this rocket bike to go and that is down.

Title: Tesla Giga Berlin Faces Further Delay Over Hibernating Snakes (and sand lizards)
That's it! Once the news goes big, it's time to buy the dip! Take advantage of these motherfuckin' snakes on a motherfuckin' Cybertruck. This is big news!

[Not The Onion](https://www.benzinga.com/news/20/12/18706583/tesla-giga-berlin-faces-further-delay-over-hibernating-snakes)

&gt; A court in Germany has told the automaker to suspend clearing a forest at the site where the factory is to be built.  
&gt;  
&gt;The court reportedly ordered the suspension after environmentalists  said that cutting trees at the site could endanger hibernating snakes. ...  
&gt;  
&gt;Authorities are also looking at claims by the activists regarding sand  lizards  also known by their scientific name Lacerta agilis  which may  be threatened by Teslas activities.

Title: [DD] GME shareholder DD and support thread
This is for shareholders only, if you bought calls expiring before late Jan you probably can't read since almost every DD before this told you to buy shares or LEAPs.

So anyway after GME management has shown themselves to be as retarded as we are, I thought I'd share a few things for the newbies to help cope and recoup losses after today's shit show. if you read my previous post you would've expected a dump after Q3 earnings, although I have to admit I was expecting a 10% dump, not a 17% dump. That shelf offering was completely unexpected and the only valid reason for having it IMO would be for management to sell some shares during a squeeze to help raise funds. There are a few other reasons that people brought up that I thought made sense, no need for me to repeat it here. 

Fundamentally the earnings were pretty much as expected, a better than expected loss was pretty much priced in and things look like they're on track for Q4. Management closed more unprofitable stores, reduced inventory, sold their private jet (lol), and e-commerce is up. Risks to that outlook would be a restart of lockdowns and stimulus not being passed on time. Remember that IWM and many other ETFs hold quite a lot of GME shares, so a dump in those means we dumping as well. Don't forget to think about the risk of an overall market dump, since we are getting close to dec OPEX with record low put/call ratios, this market is being driven up by call buying and MM hedging can dump just as hard as they pump. I'm just gonna go ahead and guess that'll take place between late dec- early Feb, watch for changes in option positioning and VIX term structure for clues.

Between now and Q4, the only catalyst for a durable pump would be the announcement of deals like the one with MSFT (there are rumors of a deal with SONY, not likely IMO), reports of VERY strong sales of consoles (good isn't good enough). We will likely start to have a slow ramp-up leading up to the earnings. These are your reasons to bag hold. 

People keep on asking RC to start a takeover but I doubt that will happen, in fact, I think RC might just sell his stake, since it's already up like 300%. Don't make any significant moves based on speculations on what RC might do.

For the immediate near term, figure out how to sell covered calls if you haven't already, selling weeklies can help bring down your cost basis, especially while IV is high. iBorrow shows borrow costs at 50%, which is near ATH I think, we might get a small but significant short-covering rally, sell your calls into these rallies. On the other hand, WSB might FOMO into weekly puts, which will also inevitably backfire but drag prices down in the process, take advantage of this by finding put walls near support and selling puts at a price you're comfortable DCA-ing at. 

Keep your eyes on the prize, which IMO really just come down to a new console cycle, the fact that there is a shortage of consoles right now just means people will be forced to shop at GME when other giants like AMZN or WMT runs out of stock. Keep an eye on any news about logistics and supply chain, if the giants get the upper hand in procuring new consoles, that will seriously damage the bull thesis

Title: DOCU
$DOCU really impressive call. Some highlights for me:

- net revenue retention rate = 122%
- still in the early innings of a $25B TAM
- Billings increase of 63% yoy
- operating expenses totaled 66% of total revenue... versus 72% year ago quarter

The adoption of Agreement Cloud is so logical for all companies in all markets. 

This is currently trading @ about 33.5x revenue. But with a target increase of 285% revenue in the coming years, this still looks cheap. Bullish

Title: SPACS on SPACS on SPACS... the case for $SAMA
Alright fellow degenerate brethren - I have for you a SPAC which believe it or not has not had much of a run up at all. And for once, here is a post before the stock has actually mooned. First time poster long time follower so here goes: 

SPAC Ticker $SAMA, price at time of writing: $12.60; to be merging with Clever Leaves $CLVR post merger. 

**Clever Leaves** 

Clever Leaves is a vertically integrated multinational cannabis company. The vertical integration basically means that it runs everything from genetics to distribution and branding. 

https://imgur.com/gallery/GTs1l27

Operations are basically broken up into two main categories: 1. Branded nutraceutical company (in the U.S.), and 2. Global B2B cannabis business. Clever Leaves currently distributed products into more than 10,000 retail locations in the US - this will be key once cannabis is federally legal. On the international side, the company has operations in Colombia where it has 1.8 million square feet of greenhouse. Further - its Colombia operation is EU GMP-certified. In Portugal its one of the few companies authorized to cultivate, import, and export cannabis. In Germany they have an investment in Canastiva - a significant player in import and distribution of cannabis. 

What separates Clever Leaves from other players is mainly that its Colombian cannabis assets produce at 1/10 the cost of most Canadian farms and that they already have a foothold in Europe with a key EU GMP certification already secured. Compare this to others like Canopy, Aphria, and Tilray who all face the burden of expensive production facilities.  (Of note, the company recently signed a deal with Canopy Growth Corporation to supply cannabis extract products for distribution in Latin America.)

https://imgur.com/gallery/RRA5FXc


Numbers: 

- Clever Leaves produces at a cost of just $0.20 per gram - which is around 1/10 of the cost of major production facilities in Canada. Compare this to Tilray for example with a production cost of $3.97 per gram and Aphria with a cost of $0.88 per gram.
- The company expects by 2022 to have $140 million in revenue and $47 million in EBITDA 
- Current market cap of around $148 million; After merger there will be 32.9 million shares outstanding fully diluted which would put the market cap of CLVR around $414.5 million on todays stock price of $12.6
- Enterprise Value (EV) to sales ratio is only 2.4x; compare this to Tilray who are 3x and Aurora who is 4x and none of them are even profitable.

Weve all seen how crazy SPACs have rallied this year - this one has flown under the radar and will likely pick up steam really soon. Vote for merger is Dec. 17 so get in at this price while you still can. I see this $20+ by end of next week. 

**TLDR: Buy SAMA calls, shares, warrants whatever floats your boat but do it ASAP.. merger vote set for Dec 17 to merge with Clever Leaves (weed)**

Title:   Twilio (TWLO) - More than meets the eye with this absolute MONSTER@Deltalake takes a swim in the River Twilio  
** Twilio (TWLO) **

**TLDR; Twilio is a cloud services and communication platform.**  The company's software helps app developers embed voice, text and video, and facilitates communication between cloud-based platforms. Demand for that software has risen due to the pandemic, which has reduced face-to-face contact. **Firms have price targets as big as $550 and Alex M from Baron Funds is super super long the stock. Along with Fastly (FSLY), this is a very safe and solid 20-30% growth stock in the next 3 months.**

Equities research analysts expect that Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) will announce sales of $453.46 million for the current fiscal quarter, [**Zacks**](https://www.americanconsumernews.net/scripts/click.aspx?Zacks=1) reports. Eight analysts have provided estimates for Twilio's earnings, with estimates ranging from $450.07 million to $458.00 million. Twilio reported sales of $331.22 million during the same quarter last year, which indicates a positive year-over-year growth rate of 36.9%. The firm is expected to issue its next quarterly earnings results on Wednesday, February 3rd. 

Investors clearly believe Twilio has established itself as a vital service. The company's stock price has tripled this year, boosting Lawson's fortune to an estimated $2.3 billion. Lawson recently talked by video to The Associated Press.

"At third quarter's end, a total of 71 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock, a change of 8% from one quarter earlier. On the other hand, there were a total of 63 hedge funds with a bullish position in TWLO a year ago. With the smart money's positions undergoing their usual ebb and flow, there exists a few notable hedge fund managers who were increasing their holdings considerably (or already accumulated large positions). "

"Twilio added 8,000 customers in the quarter, growing its customer base by 20% year-over-year. Dollar-based net expansion rate of existing customers clocked in at an impressive 137%. Revenues rose 52% year-over-year. Operating margins expanded 285 basis points. What was an operating loss in the year ago quarter, swung to a profit this quarter  marking the third consecutive quarter of positive operating profits."

" In 2021, we will get widespread distribution of multiple Covid-19 vaccines, which will spark consumer behavior normalization and a rebound in general economic activity. Amid this rebound in economic activity, corporate spending will rebound. This rising tide will lift all boats in corporate spending budgets, Twilio included. "

Title: $FCX  is literally golden-orange tendies!
######Copper in Tech:
 
Electrical-based technology is the future; and electrical technology requires copper.
 
Just look to Teslas 10% gain in share price today and profit numbers last quarter (surpassing expectations).
 
Tesla is not an auto company  it is a *technology* company, involved with a spectrum of industries: automotive, space, electronics, high-speed transportation, solar power, among others.
 
And Tesla is just one firm of many in the tech space  this is seen in the NASDAQ, for example, which up nearly 50% in the past year *alone*! The tech sector is experiencing growth at an *astounding* pace.
 
With all this technology and need for copper  its no surprise that Copper is approaching its highest prices since January 2011!
 
And where will this COPPER *come from*??
 
######Enter Freeport-McMoRan ($FCX) :
 
$FCX is an American-based mining firm  one of the largest producers of copper in the world.
 
The fact that $FCX is American is important. A majority of $FCXs mines are in the USA (9 out of 13). With global tensions between China and USA running high, it is anticipated that copper sourced and purchased locally may provide major benefits to American tech firms in the future. For example, tariffs on foreign metals may be implemented if China-USA tensions continue  making American copper that much more enticing to both investors and enterprises alike. China poses a major threat: over the past decade they have ramped up precious earth metal mining to record levels. US Government way put in place new laws to help incentivize American mining firms like $FCX to also expand their mining practices. $FCX would be a prime benefactor of a government policy move, should one take place.
 
There is no doubt that $FCX will be a huge player in the Copper mining/distribution in the future  and this is made dramatically clear in the growth of its stock price: Up 50% in past 3 months, Up 125% in past 6months!
 
Current price: $FCX = $24.60

Title: Previewing This Week's IPOs
The December IPO finale is finally here. This week's repertoire includes six IPOs and two SPACs altogether expecting to raise $7.2 billion. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) and DoorDash Inc (NYSE:DASH) will be leading the way, with Airbnb planning to raise $2.44 billion from the sale of its Class A stock, and Doordash going for $3.1 billion.

Airbnb

By being responsible for over 327 million bookings in 2019, this home-sharing start-up company is the market leader when it comes to short-term rentals. Even with many canceled bookings and much lower interest than before the pandemic, Airbnb managed to rebound from COVID-19 and show positive free cash flow. Airbnb's investors include Sequoia Capital, Silver Lake, Founders Fund, Greystar Real Estate, Sixth Street, DST Global, and Accel. The company has raised a total of $5.8 billion.

DoorDash

DoorDash already raised $2.26 billion from SVF Fast, Sequoia Capital, and Greenview Investment. This delivery service giant counts over 390,000 merchants, over 18 million users, and 1 million Dasher' delivery persons. New users are acquired through online marketing and word of mouth recommendations. The company's strategy to have high expenses in sales and marketing departments finally resulted in generating a sharp increase in revenues. This efficiency rate is calculated as the amount of additional revenue is generated from one dollar of expenses in sales and marketing. This ratio has doubled to 2.2x in the latest reporting period. Even before the pandemic, restaurant digital orders have been steadily growing 23% annually (on average) since 2013. The COVID-19 pandemic has just accelerated this trend.

C3.ai

C3.ai (NYSE:AI), an AI software provider for accelerating digital transformation, plans to raise $504 million in its IPO, at a $4.3 billion market cap. The company's focus is on predictive maintenance, inventory optimization, energy management, customer relationship management, precision health, and anti-money laundering, which all result in a learning software that aims to help businesses make better decisions. The company's latest financials can be summarized as a growing revenue with a decelerated growth rate, high levels of gross profit with uneven gross margin, reduced operating losses, and a glimpse of positive cash flow seen in operations.

Certara

Certara (NASDAQ:CERT) is a leader in biosimulation helping to reduce cycle times, lower costs, and improve outcomes for patients, during the drug discovery and development processes. The company has 1,600 clients across 60 countries, including global biopharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, and regulatory agencies. Certara plans to raise $500 million in its IPO at a $3.1 billion market cap.

Hydrofarm Holdings Group

Hydrofarm Holdings Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:HYFM), a supplier of hydroponics products like lighting equipment, climate control devices, garden accessories, and other related products, plans to raise $130 million in its IPO, at a $520 million market cap. The company manufactures and distributes stated products through its subsidiaries, and it serves customers in the U.S. and Canada, with a focus on the cannabis industry. The company reported both profit and accelerated growth during the first nine months of the year.

PubMatic

Last but not least, an AdTech platform PubMatic, Inc. (NASDAQ:PUBM) is also joining the public market as it plans to raise $100 million. The market cap is $953 million. The company specializes in the development and implementation of online advertising software and strategies. The company's platform provides real-time programmatic transactions for the advertising and digital publishing industry.

Title: American households $100 billion behind on rent and mortgage. The 17 million households Represent $5 trillion in toxic assets.
So I accidently did a DD today, inspired by the sources of this [Washington Post Story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/12/07/unemployed-debt-rent-utilities/). The numbers behind on mortgage/rent come from [This Census Survey](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2020/demo/hhp/hhp19.html#tables). The unpaid rent/mortgage number comes from [a Philly Fed Study](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/community-development/reports/household-rental-debt-during-covid-19.pdf) estimate that the average household behind will owe ~$5,800 and multiplying it by the census numbers for behind on rent/mortgage. The real numbers may be as low 1/3 that of my estimate, but $100 billion makes for a good title. The census numbers lag a few weeks (Nov 11-23) so there also the possibility that I have slightly underestimated. 

Looking at the numbers a different way, in terms of the numbers of people eligible for eviction/foreclosure come Jan 1 when the national moratorium is lifted, the Nov 11-23 numbers represent a 45+ day delinquency. We get close to 70 million people using the raw household numbers from the census data, multiplied by the household size. One mitigating factor here is that some lenders are choosing to tack on owed mortgage payments to end the of the loan instead of seeking immediate repayment. Assuming half of the 30 million delinquent mortgages are given the option to defer payments to the end of the loan the total numbers fall to ~55 million or roughly 1/6 of the US population. The other mitigating factor is the patchwork of local and state eviction moratoriums in many of the large cities and populous costal states, which account for roughly 2/3rds of the population. This result is better but still grim, between 15-20 million up for eviction, concentrated in areas without eviction moratoriums where the eviction rate will be roughly 1 in 6. Many forced from their homes will never make a significant contribution ever again, those that do it will be years before they get back on their feet.

Another metric to look at is the value of the housing that the tens of billions in missed rent/mortgage payments represent. Doing quick and dirty math of 300k median housing price times 17 million households gives the astonishing $5.1 trillion in toxic residential assets. Using 2/3rds to account for the lower per unit cost of apartments and condos that's still $3.5 trillion and who knows what multiple of that number is tied up in MBSs and derivatives dependent on those loans. This also doesn't account for the lost value as millions of vacant houses and apartments start flooding every market without an eviction moratorium. 

note: I'm not expecting a new Stimulus bill before the 116th congress adjourns, so I'm not considering its effects. Both sides keep drawing lines in the sand the other wont cross, and have been for 7 months. Or put another way, we ain't getting shit with DOW@30k. Even if the eviction moratorium gets extended all we're doing is driving further up the mountain before driving off the cliff. 

TL;DR: Tens of Billions of missed payments, trillions in toxic assets, millions becoming homeless starting Jan 1, millions of evections starting Jan 1, a flood of vacant units destroying rental and property prices, cats and dogs living together, it's September 1929, only all the speakeasies are closed. 

Oh yeah, I haven't even considered commercial properties.

Our beloved TWEETER IN CHEIF will be missed. We all know he stares at market charts more then half of us half-wits. But having looked, there is a trend that follows. 

The POTUS PUMPS tweets have historically lead to a following Donny Dump day.

Title: $PLTR Charting DD For You Guys 
When charting this ticker, I review the hourly chart as the daily chart due to the recent IPO.

tldr; PLTR will hit $31 tomorrow or I'll remove my right nut (the largest of the three).

 

 First less important, $AI comes out tomorrow in the same field space. With a relatively good looking IPO. $AI and $PLTR share a very similar investor-base which will bring more eyes onto big-data. People that are not already invested in big-data will take a second look at it tomorrow. I expect $AI to shoot up tomorrow as well and will be putting a few grand into it.

&amp;#x200B;

  Second, multiple indicators are about to meet at the same spot. The 61.8% fib (arguably the most important for bullish trend), the 50MA (hourly), and the center point of the Std Deviation all meet together. $PLTR has shown to respect all (besides center Std Deviation) indicators pretty well, either hesitating or completely redirecting.

 Third, Shitron is now irrelevant and has moved on to harass $LAZR and his braindead followers have clearly given up on $PLTR. It seems very clear than he is a boomer, and should stick to shorting boomer senior citizen stocks like $IL, $AL, $MC, and $SN.

 Fourth,  

Title: Why you shouldn't buy C3.AI
I know most of you have no attention span and the thought of doing any real due diligence makes you want to retreat to your mother's wombs but take 30 seconds and look at or listen to some of C3.AI's ads. They are the most jargon-filled garbage AI/ML ads designed to target dumb boomers and non-technical millennials who don't know better. If I tried to make a parody of AI ads it would be a C3.AI ad.

Verbatim from one of their TV spots: "Enterprise AI enables organizations to use artificial intelligence at enterprise scale." NO FUCKING SHIT.

This IPO is just their decade-long scam finally paying off and you suckers are falling for it. 

That being said the ticker is literally AI so I know it will moon because of you idiots.

&amp;#x200B;

\* obviously the big news - partnership with AWS. This was ACTUALLY ANNOUNCED IN JANUARY. People are just now starting to catch on. The two tech companies will co-develop and market BlackBerry IVY, a new "cloud-connected intelligent vehicle data platform" that offers automakers a "standardized secure way to read and analyze vehicle sensor data." IVY will merge BlackBerry's QNX embedded OS for vehicles with AWS' IoT (Internet of Things) and machine learning services.

&amp;#x200B;

\* The slow-down in car production hurt BB, but that is expected to turn around in 2021

&amp;#x200B;

SPECULATION:

WE MAY SEE MORE BIG NAME PARTNERSHIPS-

\* In a 2015 interview, CEO John Chen mentioned the possibility of working with companies involved in the development of self-driving cars, including Google, Tesla, and Apple.

  [https://youtu.be/kB6chGFjwHg?t=323](https://youtu.be/kB6chGFjwHg?t=323)

Some people seem to think bb is already under the hood of spacex's falcon.. but I couldn't find a good press release / source for that so..... 

\-----------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY:

BLACKBERRY HAS:

* CONTRACTS WITH THE AIR FORCE AND HUGE PRIVATE COMPANIES, 
* $1 BILLION IN MOSTLY RECURRING REVENUE
* SOFTWARE IN 175 MILLION VEHICLES
* A CEO WHO WANTS TO PARTNER WITH TESLA



TLDR:

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice

POSITION:

I'm going to wait / hope for a pullback, then 10c 1/22 or shares.. probably a longer play. Otherwise just YOLO into the top rn

Title: PSA to TSLA Traders
S&amp;P inclusion date is 12/21.  What this means is that the shares are supposed to be owned by market open on 12/21... which means most shares should be purchased by close of market on 12/18. However, funds have +/- 3 days to make the purchase, so 12/23 (and maybe 24th) is also perfectly valid for them to buy on.  Then there is the fact that, in the face of a big runup, they may opt to just miss their tracking marker for a few days while hoping for a 'sale' on TSLA.

Historically most funds purchase in the 24-48 hours leading up to inclusion date, although TSLA is anything but business as usual.

If you are trying to time a buy (or sell), the drop may not be until 12/28 or later.  It's possible we even get a squeeze AFTER 12/28 as funds look around and realize the price is still rising.

The .8% of float being issued today into a 30% of float forced-buy did almost nothing to relieve buying pressure.

----

Ok I had to meet the DD tag requirements, but that's not really my PSA.  My PSA is that if you made a lot of money on Tesla options this year, **be sure to set aside 5% or whatever to place an order for a Tesla** to be delivered after 1/1.  As long as everyone does this, we should be able to keep this ride going for all of 2021.

Shoutouts to whomever started the snapshot cheat sheet

Title: ZUO primed for LT growth
**TL; DR:** ZUO is primed and ready for a long climb.

I hold short term calls and several shares of Zuo.

**General Thesis**
Zuora is a SaaS company providing billing, payment, collection, and data analysis tools for companies that use subscription payments for revenue.  The main drivers for its revenue are the number of users and the amount of usage.  Anyone that pays attention, knows that the number of subscription companies is going up and up.  It is a proven model that many companies enjoy.  Thus, Zuora is aiming to provide the software tools to help those companies best leverage the model.

**Numbers**
Even during the pandemic, where cost cutting pressures have inspired many to cut their subscriptions, Zuora was able to obtain 11% YoY growth and 31% increase in customer usage YoY.  Since 2017, the gross profit has steadily increased about 35% each year and looks to maintain that pace in 2020.

The stock price dropped from 2018 until more recently because of high net losses in 2019 (substantial increased operating expenses due to being a publicly-traded company) and the black swan event that was the pandemic.  Further, the revenue didn't increase as much in 2019 (40%) as it did in 2018 (49%).

However, the operating expenses (R&amp;D, marketing, etc.) are increasing at a slower rate than the gross profit in 2020, which is reflected in the decreasing net losses reported in the past 3 out of 4 quarters.  It is worth mentioning that they beat analyst expectations in all of those 4 reported quarters.  They project a net loss of $14mn with a revenue over $300mn in 2021.  However, I suspect this might be revised upward after the effects of the Stripe Partnership take hold.

**Stripe Agreement**
Many of Stripe's customers use the subscription model.  And Stripe has a lot of customers with famous brands.  As reported on MarketWatch, the partnership will allow Zuora customers to use the payment processing and fraud detection technology of Stripe. In the announcement, the CEO of Zuora mentioned that companies with recurring-revenue models (subscriptions) have a lower chance of fraud, so they should be able to attract better payment-processing rates.  To me, if Zuora is able to provide its customers better payment-processing rates, then this provides an incentive for existing Stripe customers to use Zuora.  The decrease in payment-processing rates could subsidize the cost of Zuora, while the tools of Zuora could help increase revenue for those companies.  The partnership could be a catalyst for Zuora growth.

**Industry PE Ratio**
The current market cap is $1.4bn on revenue of $300mn.  With PE ratios so high these days, especially with software companies, I think any sign of profitability from Zuora this year could send the stock price flying.

**Conclusion**
Thus, I am bullish long term with Zuora, and because the market is forward looking, I think people will try to jump in early.  This could cause the stock price to bounce fairly quickly in the short term, too.  Last I checked, the current days to cover for the shorts is 4 days.

Title: INTC (Intel) switching to TEAM (Atlassian) from AVGO (Broadcom's Rally) 
It appears Intel is moving away from Rally for task management tracking into Jira (TEAM)  
It's definitely not a small number of teams within Intel moving to Atlassian, from my research it looks like they are moving most of the company to Jira, and moving fast.

Intel's public accessible jira dashboards logins  
[https://jira.hpdd.intel.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa](https://jira.hpdd.intel.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa)  
[https://digitalrequest.intel.com/login.jsp](https://digitalrequest.intel.com/login.jsp)  


public github references - [https://jira.devtools.intel.com](https://jira.devtools.intel.com) (inaccessible DNS. meaning its private)  
found from [https://github.com/projectceladon/peeknpoke](https://github.com/projectceladon/peeknpoke)

  
This can be a big move. Intel has 110,000 employees. The cost for Atlassian is user based licensing.  


Looking at job reqs on Linkedin and Intel's corporate site, shows lots of their new positions for software engineers and technical management now require some kind of Jira experience and/or Atlassian api and configuration experience. No longer wanting Rally experience. Linkedin also shows Intel employees who's job responsibilities are include Jira management and engineers who develop Jira dashboards.

What has everyone done during Covid? Hang out in their backyard or become a boogaloo boy. They never closed for Covid and they allow curbside. Shits gonna pop on Friday for earnings. Load up now so you can afford some shoes

Title: NEXT SPAC PLAY $FUSE
Don't know why no one is talking about this one but its a fintech SPAC run by a bunch of old white dudes who manage highly successful hedge funds and ETFs like the fucking SPY and GLD. Don't know about y'all but that's the only DD I need to jump in. 

If you're still not convinced, look at tickers like BFT which are merging in the same sector that are already up 37% YTD and go and buy yourself some shares before you come back to this post regretting it after the hype starts. 

My average is at $9.94 

Title: Cleveland Cliffs
The company just built a brand new taconite facility in northern Minnesota.  Stocks were trading at 77 $ five years ago.  With the Biden administration setting its sites on a giant infrastructure program this is going to go through the roof.

Title: $BB May surprisingly be a competitor for TSLA now - Great potential in BB
[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k99qd6/bb\_new\_competitor\_to\_tesla/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k99qd6/bb_new_competitor_to_tesla/)

**From the article:**

## "Teslas new competitor

Dont laugh, but **BlackBerry** [(TSX:BB)](https://www.fool.ca/company/tsx-bb-blackberry/174/)[(NYSE:BB)](https://www.fool.ca/company/nyse-bb-blackberry/176/) is now one of Teslas biggest competitors. Seriously.

Forget everything you know about this company. It no longer makes smartphones. Today, its all about cybersecurity [software](https://www.fool.ca/2020/09/21/this-tech-stock-is-better-than-shopify-tsxshop/). BlackBerrys biggest product, its QNX security platform, is already installed in more than 160 million cars worldwide. Nine out of the top ten car manufacturers license the companys software.

BlackBerry controls a pivotal part of the value chain. As cars go autonomous, security will be more important than ever. A hacking vulnerability could be lethal. BlackBerrys software can use artificial intelligence to prevent attacks *before* they happen!

This is valuable position to have, and others know it. **Amazon** recently partnered with BlackBerry to augment the QNX system. StradVision, a leader in vision processing technology for fully autonomous vehicles, just announced that theyll be deeply integrating QNX into its offerings.

Expect Tesla to develop its own tech in-house, but nearly every competitor has already signaled their intent to use BlackBerrys security software. Growth will take time, as the autonomous vehicle story is a decade in the making, but Tesla already knows that BlackBerry will be the backbone of its competitors success."

Title: 5-10x Potential with SOLY (Soliton) small cap medical device with strong ties to Abbvie. Eventual buyout
  

TLDR; Buy SOLY (Soliton), stock will be a 5x in 2-years or less and 10x in 5-years or less. Technology/marketing/sales/etc is being led by ABBV executives for eventual buyout and integration into their aesthetics business. New CEO is a Winklevoss 2.0 and the other brother is VP of marketing at AbbVie. Executives, management team, and medical advisory team all have strong ties to helping coolsculpting get bought out by Allergan for $2.48 billion.

Ok, its time I shared an actually good pic for you nards to make some money. Disclaimer here, there are no options presently available for the stock and you may need to hold for at least a year. So now that 90% of you degenerates are no longer reading here is the DD.

Soliton is a company that develops, produces, markets, and sells a medical device that uses rapid acoustic pulse technology to provide minimally invasive (and non-invasive) treatment for several aesthetics treatments and enhancements. Pretty much they have invented a device that removes tattoos in 3 visits, reduces the appearance of cellulite, and can remove the appears of scars. Their business model is based on the razor and blade strategy where they sell the device then profit from each cartridge used in the treatments.

1) Invented by Christopher Capelli, an MIT engineer and medical doctor, who led the office of technology-based ventures at the university of Texas before leaving to co-found Soliton.

a. Significant because this mans job was literally to review medical device technology. He must have seen hundreds or thousands of different devices in his time there and has seen which ones workout and which dont. Upon coming across this device (which maybe he made, maybe a student made, maybe it was a combination of both) he ups and quits his job because THIS IS IT! The one that will make him a billionaire

2) The Science Advisory Board for Soliton has 9 people who are members of the Zeltiq/Coolsculpting/Abbvie Medical Advisory team. Ironically enough, this device directly compliments the CoolSculpting treatments and the aesthetics portfolio that Abbvie is building out.

a. Significant because CoolSculpting has been growing and become more and more readily available and once Solitons RAP devices launches it will be directly integrated into each office.

3) The Winklevoss twins 2.0 are Brent and Brad Hauser. They both attended Standford where they were track stars they eventually made their way into medical device industry. Following a similar path they were both involved at the executive level in Zeltiq (ie. Coolsculpting) before the buyout and then were executives for Allergan (Allergan bought Zeltiq, then allergan was bought by Abbvie) and eventually Abbvie. Although working in different capacities they were closely tied in working on the projects/business.

a. Significant because what has happened is Abbvie seem to already be planting their people at Soliton to guide it in the right direction and ensure its success before they decide to add it to their portfolio. They told Brad, who was on the board of directors for Soliton while working at Abbvie, to take the CEO position so they have more control. Meanwhile ol Brent is still at Abbvie, probably talking over thanksgiving dinner about all the money they will make when the buyout happens in a few years.

4) FDA approval has already been granted for the purpose of removing tattoos. Tattoos can now be removed in 3 visits vs what would normally take 8-10 visits. Soliton has hired our marketing team and distribution partners for their launch in Q2 2021. FDA approval for purposes of cellulite treatment should take place in the next 1-3 months. 

a. Significant because they have a real product with real results that adds real value to the market and by this time next year they will be rolling in revenue. FDA approval for the device has already been granted so the approval for cellulite treatment is damn near guaranteed. Then it is on to the FDA approval for keloid and hypertrophic scar reduction which is supposedly a bigger market than tattoo removal and cellulite reduction combined.

5) Lack of options and small number of shares outstanding has caused institutions to overlook the company for now. This will probably change once volume picks up, revenues start showing next year, and cellulite FDA approval is finalized.

All you hobos (myself included) always gripe about someone posting DD *after* the stock had it big climb. I was going to wait to prove right, but I though this would be helpful for everyone to know of this lingering opportunity. I sincerely hope you make money. Once you start connecting the dots, you can see how this company is actually being groomed to be acquired by Abbvie and if they spend the same amount on SOLY as they did for Zeltiq (2.48 billion), you are looking at 13x return from todays price.

Why would Abbive just buy them now? Well, its a pain the a$$ do buy a company, especially one that hasnt sold anything yet. I think they want to just leave the heavy lifting and regulatory crap to Soliton but once the FDA approvals go through, sales start happening, and they get concrete proof of the market potential, then they will step in. And with so many board members and executives with ties to Abbvie, who do you think will get the first opportunity?! 

Goodluck to all

Title: PLTR Stock - Main Summary Points
**Sales Growth**

Palantir's (PLTR) growth increased by 51.87% in the last quarter. As shown within Figure 1, this is a quick and promising recovery from the COVID quarter. This coupled with the downturn of COVID cases and PLTR's active involvement in combatting the virus should continue to enable revenue uptick. It should be particularly noted that PLTR'S September Net Income (\~900m) has increased dramatically now they have signed a number of significant contracts.

&amp;#x200B;

**DO WALL STREET ANALYSTS RECOMMEND INVESTORS BUY SHARES OF PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES?**

6 Wall Street analysts have issued "buy," "hold," and "sell" ratings for Palantir Technologies in the last year. There are currently 5 hold ratings and 1 buy rating for the stock, resulting in a consensus recommendation of "Hold." This is relevant as of 12/2. **I got banned before making this post because the mods are fgts so I'm too lazy to update.**

&amp;#x200B;

**WHEN IS PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES' NEXT EARNINGS DATE? SHALL I GET SHARES TO HOLD FOR GLORIOUS TENDIES?**

Palantir Technologies is scheduled to release its next quarterly earnings announcement on Thursday, February 11th 2021. Holding shares until this point would be my advice, especially given their newly executed contracts with substantial SLAs.

&amp;#x200B;

**WHEN DID PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES IPO?**

(PLTR) raised $0 in an initial public offering (IPO) on Wednesday, September 30th 2020. The company issued 257,100,000 shares at $0.00 per share. None served as the underwriter for the IPO. This is a NEW stock. It will be volatile, as is a lot of IPOs.

&amp;#x200B;

**WHO ARE PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES' MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS?**

Palantir Technologies' stock is owned by a variety of retail and institutional investors. Top institutional shareholders include Point72 Asset Management L.P. (1.95%), BlackRock Inc. (1.91%), Soros Fund Management LLC (1.20%), Allen Operations LLC (0.45%), Myriad Asset Management Ltd. (0.31%) and Public Sector Pension Investment Board (0.29%). Company insiders that own Palantir Technologies stock include Alexander C Karp, Alexander D Moore, David A Glazer, Matthew A Long, Shyam Sankar and Stephen Andrew Cohen.

**WHAT IS PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES' STOCK PRICE TODAY?**

One share of PLTR stock can currently be purchased for approximately $28.87. High band priced at 36.70 by EOY based on current trends. Low band priced at $21.10 by EOY based on current trends. This prediction is indicative of current trends, however would not be a sign for future performance. My personal view is if you own shares, hold them. Similar companies within PLTR's industry Oracle (ORCL), SAP (SAP), Shopify (SHOP), ServiceNow (NOW), Intuit (INTU), Square (SQ), Snowflake (SNOW), Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Autodesk (ADSK), VMware (VMW) on average have shown a steady uptick of growth and will continue to do so given the future viability of the product. Buying is under your own discretion, if you think that big data is going to be a part of the future then consider a buy. If not, don't.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**: Newly IPO'd company, high likelihood to continue to grow exponentially over time now commercialised, strong contracts but volatile stock. 

**Recommendation:** Ban anyone who bad-mouths PLTR

**Raven Industries \[RAVN\]**

Finally caught you autists lacking for once. Now brace your hairy tangled assholes for this amphetamine-fueled diamond buttplug of speculation.

Raven industries is a budding tech company that has stretched its little paws into nearly every memeable sector. How this hasnt been talked about around here **(at all)** is beyond me.

Theyve got the **A.A.S** trifecta of meme as a part of their core business plan.

**Autonomous Vehicles**: Preorders for their new AutoCart line of autonomous agricultural vehicles just opened on December 2nd.

**Aerospace**: Their Aerostar branch saw record numbers for customer flight campaigns. Basically, they send balloons into space for wifi or surveillance or some shit idk. They also use these balloons to monitor atmospheric conditions and make satellite missions.

&gt;Our lighter-than-air platforms have helped NASA, Google, the U.S. Air Force, and many others achieve and exceed dynamic missions, including communications, data relay, surveillance, intelligence, and more. [Source](https://ravenaerostar.com) 

**Surveillance:** Why fight the inevitable? Work with big brother, not against him. A resume that includes border control, counterterrorism, maritime security, and military defense has daddy defense creaming in his seat as we speak. More contracts are sure to come.

Down **23%** from the ATH (

**Breakout** on the 1D and 4H charts

Once (if) we bounce and confirm that resistance has become support, I intend on adding to my position.

**Disclaimer**: Options chain limited and volume is kinda dogshit, so this is a shares kinda play unless you can stomach the volatility and plan on holding for a while imho.

That said: 

5x 3/21/21 $35C, 4x 2/19/21 on my TD set-and-forget acct.

Title: GDRX = Free tendies
What is GDRX?
GDRX or Goodrx is a company that finds coupons and compares prices for prescription drugs and all that stuff. Stock had its ipo a few months ago and suffered its first dip in november due to Amazon opening its pharmacy however the CEO has stated that Amazon wont hurt business and isnt a competitor

Now early november GDRX gapped down from $50 to $35 and has sat around this stage for a bit but recently looks to have broken out of its wedge. The contracts are really decent and could see good return if the stock continues to gain some momentum and fill the gap it currently has

High delta and gamma and low theta is nice on tgese contracts as its profitable even if the stock runs a fww $. Currently shares are at 37.50 which its seen decent support at the last few days

Positions for you retards who have been waiting 1/15/21 45c 

All this stock needs is a little momentum and itll run and fill the gap. Even if it doesnt hit back to pre drop levels at 50. A $4-5  rise will be profitable with the current delta

Essentially free tendies at the 1/15/21 45c or 40c

Title: INPX - A High Risk High Reward Bet
 

Hello fellow retards. With all this Palantir hype, I have a ticker that is right up your alley. Inpixon is a company that has a platform that provides organizations with the tools to ingest indoor data. They literally have software that can track every cell-phone user in a building.

&amp;#x200B;

[From Inpixon.com](https://preview.redd.it/wtx257nfvz361.png?width=1249&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f77398475ed74527b1301f23820d297e61c6709b)

**Covid Contract**

* Inpixon was just selected to be utilized by a **TOP PHARMACEUTICAL** company to track vaccine assets when they role out. This is massive news that has been left unnoticed! [https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/inpixon-mapping-selected-by-leading-pharmaceutical-corporation-to-facilitate-tracking-of-covid-19-vaccine-related-assets/](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/inpixon-mapping-selected-by-leading-pharmaceutical-corporation-to-facilitate-tracking-of-covid-19-vaccine-related-assets/)

**Their Current Customers**

* The Pentagon
* U.S. Army
* FedEx
* Department of Veteran Affairs
* Lenovo

**Acquisitions**

The past 2 years, I have noticed they have been massively investing in acquisitions to create a unique software platform that provides a whole platform of data ingestion and mapping for customers that others don't offer:

* Nanotron : [https://www.inpixon.com/company/news/inpixon-to-acquire-nanotron-leader-in-iot-and-uwb-technologies](https://www.inpixon.com/company/news/inpixon-to-acquire-nanotron-leader-in-iot-and-uwb-technologies)
* Blue Dot Technology: [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/inpixon-acquires-blue-dot-device-positioning-technology-and-intellectual-property-assets-expanding-inpixon-indoor-intelligence-platform-301115317.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/inpixon-acquires-blue-dot-device-positioning-technology-and-intellectual-property-assets-expanding-inpixon-indoor-intelligence-platform-301115317.html)
* Jibestream: [https://www.inpixon.com/inpixon-jibestream](https://www.inpixon.com/inpixon-jibestream)

**The stock ticker**

Inpixon has been through some massive reverse splits.

* 03/01/2017 1 for 15
* 02/06/2018 1 for 30
* 11/02/2018 1 for 4
* 001/07/2020 1 for 45

Even after all these reverse splits, the company is struggling to maintain above a dollar in stock price. Many penny stock holders have been burned throughout the years. However, I believe this gives us golden opportunity to buy in if we truly believe in the company. The CEO in the 2020 Q3 earnings has reiterated they are not planning on doing another reverse split.

**High Growth Opportunity**

* The indoor location market is projected to grow from 6.1 billion in 2020 to 17 billion in 2025
* Inpixon is in an excellent position to capture this new market with their newly acquired platforms
* Their current market cap is hovering only around 50 million. They're valuation will skyrocket as the company grows within the next few years. **Helping track covid vaccine assets when they role out may be the catalyst**

This year, mostly from luck and a little research, I have grown my miniscule 9k in my ira to around 50k. Most of the profits have come from investing in NIO and buying 1000 shares of Palantir when it was around 9.80. This is my next play. **Please don't believe whatever I say and do your own DD since I am just a fellow retard that don't know what I'm doing**

Title: FDA Analysis For Pfizer Vaccine Shows 1600 suspected covid cases in vaccine group
&gt;For the primary efficacy endpoint, the case definition for a confirmed COVID-19 case was the presence of **at least one of the following symptoms and a positive SARS-CoV-2 NAAT** within 4 days of the symptomatic period

This means, to be counted as a postive in the results, you must be symptomatic AND have a positive test

&gt;Among 3410 total cases of suspected but unconfirmed COVID-19 in the overall study population, 1594 occurred in the vaccine group vs. 1816 in the placebo group.

Here, we can see that they didn't test 3000 suspected cases. They would not be suspected cases if they were tested, by definition. Clearly this is a big deal as the placebo group shows many more infections

&gt;Phase 3 breakdown, sourced from top Candian biostatician, department head: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EmezgmAXMAMCDBT?format=jpg&amp;name=large

Here we can see the lack of testing. Of 40,000 participants, assuming all were a placebo, would yield ~200 infections.

200/40,000 yields a SARS2 prevelance across the 40k sample size of 0.5%. Clearly, world odometer data shows a much higher amount of infection.

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/

15,000,000 / 330,000,000 = 4.5%

Clearly, pfizer just didn't test. SPY 6/9/21 270p. Stonks go down. Honestly, i would expect the market to realize this. But jim cramer is now a sports betting clown and cnbc hires lacross players to host its rv shows.

Title: NNOX is about to change the fucking world
 Now, what is Nano-x Imaging, and why should you degenerates know about this company? Some people refer to them as the TSLA of the medical imaging world, Ill try to summarize wtf NNOX does as quickly as possible in the next "few" points.

&amp;#x200B;

1.**NNOX (** [Nanox.vision](https://www.nanox.vision/) **)** is a medical imaging startup that has developed a X-Ray source magnitudes of orders cheaper than current technology. Its basically the same improvement as going from an incandescent bulb to a modern led.

Why is this important? X-Rays, Ct scans, and other radiological imaging is currently expensive as shit resulting in 2/3rds of the world being unable to access the technology. NNOX hopes to make their "biobeds" so cheap that they'll basically give them away for free \~ 14k vs the millions that the machines cost nowadays therefore allowing them to implement a better pricing model.

&amp;#x200B;

2. They will be implementing a pay per scan model allowing poorer areas without access to top radiologists to submit scans and have them processed by NNOX's radiologists and machine learning network.

This is the future more than the proprietary and patented X-ray source that will make this model possible. Cheap scans for the whole world will result in boatloads of data on every single disease and injury detectable by x-ray imaging, and that can be used to train their AI to not only make scans even cheaper but to have them process magnitudes faster and more accurately than human doctors.

&amp;#x200B;

3. They have a lot of partnerships with major payers, and have board members that are already loaded. (SK Telecom, Foxconn, SK Hynix) They have 0 reasons to risk their money and reputations on something that wont make a dent in their net worth until NNOX demonstrates and establishes their technology globally.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Finally and probably the most important point is that Citron tried to shit on them calling them a fraud. Too bad their prototype was successfully demonstrated at the RSNA conference and Citrons report was quickly disproven as a work of garbage. (Reports disproving them: [Nanox | DKA](https://www.dka.global/nanox-imaging) , [(19) Nanox Live Demonstration - RSNA 2020 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZETn3Cajio&amp;ab_channel=Nano-XImaging) )

This absolute unit really tried to convince everyone that equivalency approval isn't good enough because sir Andrew fucking Left himself discovered a new type of light that isn't equivalent to X-rays \*autism intensifies\* .

/s if you didn't get it , basically if you think that LED's cant emit equivalent light to incandescent bulbs don't buy this stock.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I can go on and on about how much good shit they have gong for em but I have the attention span of goldfish so its best to just read some of the linked articles.

TLDR:

Title: RPRX Lock-up Dump
Hi retards, im pretty sure RPRX insiders are pumping the stock to dump it better next week where millions of share will be unlocked for trading (IPO agreement). 

End of the lock-up date: 14 December 

Numbers: Now avaiable on the market: around 83M | Total shares outstanding 370M!!!!!

so the difference is 287M that is 3 and half times the shares now on the market

The stock is increasing little every day (today big +5%) but with a ridicolous low volume so i think they are driving the price higher too fool retail investors so they can dump the hell of 200+M shares at a super price! 

Why they're gonna sell? well the IPO price was 28$ so they're gonna secure some profits no?!

Do your play retards! i dont remember but 2 weeks ago someone suggested a play like this one on another stock and it went very well (the stock dumped alot as expected)

Title: The Affirm IPO and A New Way to Rip People Off
So I was browsing LULU looking at new joggers (ok fine, I was checking out the guys/girls modeling their shit) and it says $128 OR 4 payments of $32 with Afterpay which made me realize I have seen a lot of "offers" like that and wanted to see if it is a money making opportunity.

**TL;DR: Buy Affirm when its IPO goes live. Former PayPal execs are starting microlending and "buy now, pay later" companies which could become the modern credit card. Affirm is a large one is going to IPO with a potential $100M offering. The Affirm/Shopify partnership could be like Ebay/Paypal back from the internet stone age**

For the purpose of this DD, we will be looking at Sezzle and Afterpay which are currently publicly traded and Affirm which has recently registered for an IPO (more on that later). All of these companies bill themselves as Fintech companies offering alternative payment platforms and a micro financial lender. Merchants have an incentive to sign up with one of these guys because the payment platform assumes the risk while the business gets advertised on their service. These companies make money by charging merchant fees and interest on missed payments.

Starting with Sezzle cause that is the least interesting, its listed on the upside down market in Australia trading around $5 but is HQ'd in Minnesota and has [estimated revenue](https://growjo.com/company/Sezzle) of \~30M.  Sezzle reported in February that they had achieved 1M users and now with the pandemic are estimated to be around 1.8M. 6 months ago they brought in [former PayPal executive](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paul-paradis-promoted-to-company-president-and-veronica-katz-from-paypal-to-take-chief-revenue-officer-role-301090602.html) Veronica Katz as Chief Revenue Officer. Sezzle [advertises](https://sezzle.com/merchants) its business product as "Engaging the next generation" and the ability to "unlock millions of users and increase sales with zero risk".

Next is AfterPay, an actual Australia based company. They [reported](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/afterpay-announces-full-year-results-301119541.html) their year ending June 30 and revenue topped **$11B with 10M Users and 55.4K merchants.** There are tons of highlights in that report which are worth the scroll. Afterpay has a huge number of customers/products to choose from including the aforementioned LULU and other major retails stores youve heard of. They also have tons of Becky products on there including Shein, Ulta Beauty, Soma, and other places your girl shops at. 

This company, unsurprisingly, is teeming with former PayPal folks. [VP Xin Ge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xin-ge-b6b258?trk=org-employees_profile-result-card_result-card_full-click) 7 years at paypal, [Dana Stalder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dcstalder/?trk=org-employees_profile-result-card_result-card_full-click) VP back in 04-08 who is now a VC and on the Afterpay board, [Amanda Pires](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandapires1/) 9 years at Paypal now a VP at afterpay. the company is also littered with former Visa and citigroup folks

At this point for those still reading you understand what this game is all about, Affirm does the same thing as the other two. We're going to talk about Affirm and its upcoming IPO. Affirm's CEO/founder is [Max Levchin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxlevchin/) who YOU GUESSED IT was an original cofounder of Paypal and was the CTO. Affirm shares unprofitable status like so many other silicon valley companies (PLTR, UBER, etc) but totaled 174M in Q1 2020 revenue. The biggest draw here for Affirm is it's [partnership](https://www.affirm.com/press/releases/affirm-to-power-shopify-shop-pay-installments) with Shopify to use its installment payment platform and gain access to shopify's &gt;200M users. Affirm filed for an IPO to offer 100M in stock with an unannounced IPO date but will probably go in the next few months. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like there is a way to get exposure before IPO (unless you like Morgan Stanley) but the [investors](https://equityzen.com/company/affirm/) in this should tell you how big this company could be. That being said Affirm is seeking to be the credit card of the next generation who have no concept of money but will gladly take the pay for it later method. While they aren't yet profitable, this is a potential billion dollar company with potential buyouts from SQ, big banks, in the future.

**Conclusion: These companies are a hybrid of payment processors, micro lenders, and advertisers that support merchants of all sizes. With the continued explosion of online shopping and the natural human desire to worry about it later, investing in Affirm at IPO could be like getting in the ground floor of PayPal. We know about the PayPal mafia but even the lesser known execs are working on some very forward leaning companies that have huge potential. Affirm is going to IPO and its rocket both short term and long term**

Title: ADBE bull case
Greetings fellow smooth brainers! I want to share what I consider to be a very basic bull case on ADBE. 

Google, CRM and Facebook reported stellar advertising earnings this quarter. This tells me that marketing budgets have gone up as the economy has picked up. 

One sector that benefits greatly from the early stages of economic recovery is advertising. To me, ADBE represents the best of the reopening trade without the shit fundamentals and the growth trade without the pre-earnings run up or IV spike. 


Adobe is the holy grail of creatives on marketing teams everywhere. I expect this avalanche of ad money to trickle down to ADBE subscriptions. 

The stock is down today because they just completed an acquisition. This is dumb but it will not effect q3 profits which are being reported Thursday. 

ADBE has been in a tight range since Sept and much like many of its peers is poised perfectly for a breakout. 

My positions are 580c Jan 15.

Title: Last chance to get FNMA tendies 
The Trump Administration is probably gonna release them from conservatorship in the next few days which means that the stock will rise massively. Even if the government won't make the deal, the overwhelmingly conservative Supreme Court will take up the case starting on Dec. 9 (more on that here: [FNMA Supreme Court case](https://www.valuewalk.com/2020/12/steven-mnuchin-legacy-fannie-mae-freddie-mac/)). The attorneys involved in the case say that the gov is going to lose.  
BONUS: Our boy Bill Ackman is extremely bullish on this one ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_UAprkduLoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UAprkduLoo), [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlK2fcsfBts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlK2fcsfBts))

TLDR:  
FNMA to the Moon! **** (Maybe also FMCC)  
Positions: 1000 FNMA shares at average price of $2.70

Title: PFE - not too late
PFE vaccine is going to be approved by FDA within the next week, most likely. *These* are foreshadowing messages. Someone had posted a few days ago asking why PFE wasn't being talked about a great deal on WSB... it is not too late to make significant profits on the rise that will come from the vaccination approval here in the US. 

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/08/fda-says-pfizer-covid-vaccine-data-did-not-raise-safety-concerns.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/08/fda-says-pfizer-covid-vaccine-data-did-not-raise-safety-concerns.html)

Title: Going Vroom on VRM
Whats up all -- I have been watching this stock for some time and think it's finally time to make a move. Want to share my thoughts with everyone while the stock is still on the cheap.

TL;dr is I think long equity is a good move for the next 3-6 months, but since I know all of you tards only like calls a I would go with a longer term call - I did some at $70 on 4/16/21 for $0.50 a couple weeks back as well as some at $60 for 1/15/21 for $0.28 in case it moons in the short term after earnings makes it pop. 

DD below which I encourage you to read before making your own decision.

**Introduction**

The used auto market in the US is huge, fragmented, and has significant room for online sales penetration. CarMax has only 2% market share and the top 100 dealers account for less than 10%. As a result, there is ample room for multiple winners, especially as people start to move into online sales which is only \~1% of the existing used car sales! (Stat as of 2019).

COVID is a huge catalyst for upping the online used car sales penetration  it accelerated the adoption of buying cars online, a trend that was already beginning with millennials. This is an opportune time to steal share as very few dealers can actually facilitate a credible e-commerce experience for used vehicles at the moment.

We thus have a macro backdrop that fires on all fronts: Used vehicle sales have continued to increase (by volume and by ASP), the market is highly fragmented, there is an exogenous catalyst that is shifting the industry towards a greater share of online sales, and there is a first-mover with a depressed valuation.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4a41p04hsw361.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea7cb300766beeb245296d336fa2dded6ba5abff

**Growth Drivers**

1. **Offline-to-online**. The shift from offline to online for vehicle sales appears to have hit a position point of inflection. This was happening before Covid due to desire for transparency, broader unit selection, and general convenience. While autos are still only \~1% online, Covid has been a catalyst that has normalized online vehicle sales, and its one of those things that is here to stay. (Like video conferences.) Vroom will be able to help drive the shift to online by leveraging their national scale. This allows them to aggregate demand and create a central marketplace in what is a highly fragmented market. Mom and pop dealerships will lose share as a result  they wont be able to keep up with the broad selection at the Vrooms and Carvanas of the world.
2. **Marketing**. Vroom has demonstrated its ability to create meaningful value through their marketing efforts. In winter of 2019, their campaign increased revenue share from its website increased from 26% to 43%. These direct sales are higher ROI than using performance marketing (where folks often have a take rate on directed traffic), and are a real value-add in a business model where advertising performance is a differentiator among competition due to the fragmentation of the industry.
3. **Ability to add and cross-sell products**. Moving into financing and assurance products like VSCs, GAP insurance, and tire &amp; wheel packages provide another meaningful avenue of growth for Vroom. Carvana has seen success here, and it is a natural next move as Vroom continues to grow and diversify its revenue streams
4. **Mix shift on Vehicle Reconditioning Centers.** Vroom has begun building shifting its vehicle reconditioning centers to third party services. As volumes increase, they are able to achieve more attractive take rates, providing an additional stream of revenue. Vroom currently uses partners for 40-60% of reconditioning. Lowering the overhead footprint that comes with fully-owned VRCs presents furth room for margin expansion.
5. **Increasing consumer-sourced vehicles.** As Vroom has begun to build out its name, they expect to shift more towards sourcing vehicles straight from consumers. This is a higher margin opportunity than sourcing vehicles from dealers/auctions, and will provide not only volume growth for the top line, but improve the margin profile going forward.
6. **Vroom is outperforming competition on driving traffic to its website compared to CarMax, and is efficiently competing on app downloads**

**Recent Performance and Outlook**

Reflecting its very early stage of growth, Vrooms e-commerce units sold grew at more than 80% last year and are poised to do so again in 2020 despite a slowdown in growth after the pandemic struck in March (units more than doubled year-over-year in each of the three quarters ended March 2020). While the company currently working through some friction on sales support given the volume has increased so much, brokers expect growth in e-commerce units sold to re-attain its pre-pandemic pace of more than doubling year-over-year by the second quarter of 2021, translating into an acceleration in e-commerce units sold to roughly 120% next year. (Source: William Blair)

* Q3 gross profit of $25mn (+62% y/y) vs. estimates of $22.3mn (12% beat). The beat waws driven by ecommerce units reaching 8.8k (+59% vs. +74% in Q2)
* Total gross profit per unit (GPU) increased 154% q/q to $2,474, driven primarily by improvements in reconditioning and inbound logistics costs.
* Adj. EBITDA of ($35.7)mn was better than consensus at ($42.1)mn. This was because in Q3, SG&amp;A decreased by \~4%
* Management affirmed guidance above consensus estimates for the full year. As a result, Goldman Sachs increased its 12-month price target to $60 from its prior level at $52. J.P. Morgan set its price target to $70. In fact, of the 30+ equity research analysts covering the stock, \~75% rate it as a buy, and \~25% rate it as a whole &lt;1% consider it a sell.

**Downside Risks**

* Vroom could have below-average execution on scaling third-party reconditioning centers and logistics which would make margin improvement happen more slowly
* Vehicle demand could fall if we hit a major recession. (Although in 2008 it bounced back very quickly)
* If fully autonomous ride-sharing becomes a major thing and no one buys cars anymore, then Vroom would suffer

Title: ABEV DD
**ABEV**

Here is a play where you are not too late.  
Ambev SA engages in the production, distribution, and sale of beverages. Its products include beer, carbonated soft drinks, and other non-alcoholic and non-carbonated products. It operates through the following geographical segments: Brazil; Central America and Caribbean; Latin America South; and Canada.  The company was founded on July 8, 2005 and is headquartered in So Paulo, Brazil. [Source](https://money.cnn.com/quote/profile/profile.html?symb=ABEV)


**Sector Rotation**
If you look at [Finviz](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx) you can see a progression of technology falling down the ladder.  At the same time cyclicals, industrials, basic materials, and energy rose.  Energy was disproportionately beat down and is leading the 3 month &amp; 1 month relative performance, but there is a clear [sector rotation](https://abovethegreenline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sector-rotation.png) occurring.  


**[The Chart](https://imgur.com/a/5GWEplJ)**
ABEV recently broke its 200 SMA but stalled out.  However, it is climbing away from the 2020 volume point of control with 27,086 put open interest.  In 2019, the volume point of control was around $4.65 and between these two points is a [cavern of low volume](https://imgur.com/a/kYG25FW), indicating that price can traverse.

**Rating Upgrades &amp; Institutional Investment**
Ambev (NYSE:ABEV) was upgraded by research analysts at HSBC from a "hold" rating to a "buy" rating in a report issued on Monday was upgraded by research analysts at HSBC from a "hold" rating to a "buy" rating in a report issued on Monday.  Additionally, Citigroup Inc. 3% upgraded Ambev from neutral to buy, Smith Barney Citigroup upgraded from neutral to buy, ValuEngine upgraded from sell to hold, Morgan Stanley lowered from equal weight to underweight, and Zacks lowered from hold to sell.  Institutional investors and hedge funds have recently made changes to their positions in the business and now own 6.91% of the company's stock.

**Risk Factors**

**Brazil**
Our most significant market is Brazil, which has periodically experienced rates of inflation higher than expected. Inflation, along with governmental measures to fight inflation and public speculation about possible future measures, has had significant negative effects on the Brazilian economy. The annual rates of inflation, as measured by the ndice Nacional de Preos ao Consumidor (National Consumer Price Index), was 11.3% in 2015, 6.6% in 2016, 2.1% in 2017, 3.8% in 2018 and 4.3% in 2019.

Inflation for 2020 is expected to close at [1.9%](https://www.focus-economics.com/countries/brazil/news/inflation/inflation-hits-six-month-high-in-september).

**Demand**
Consumption of beer, other alcoholic beverages and soft drinks in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including Brazil, is closely linked to general economic conditions. [Source - 20-f].

**Exchange Rates**
Most of our sales are in Brazilian Reals; however, a relevant portion of our debt is denominated in foreign currencies, including U.S. dollars.  In addition, a significant portion of our cost of sales, in particular those related to packaging such as cans and bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, as well as sugar, hops and malt are denominated in or linked to the U.S. dollar, which was very volatile in recent years. Therefore, any devaluation of the real when compared to those foreign currencies may increase our financial expenses and operating costs and could affect our ability to meet our foreign currency obligations. Although our current policy is to hedge substantially all of our U.S. dollar-denominated debt and cost of sales against changes in foreign exchange rates, we cannot assure you that such hedging will be possible or available at reasonable costs at all times in the future [Source - 20-f].  If you look at the chart for [BRL to USD](https://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=BRL&amp;to=USD&amp;view=1Y), you will see a rising trend.

 i.  Profit Margin 

The figure above shows that NVidias revenue generating in terms of cost have slightly improved with a value of 0.620, compared to 0.612 in 2019. 

 ii.  Operating Margin 

The chart above shows NVidias ability to generate cash from its operating activities have slightly decreased, however, it is anticipated that the operating revenue will significantly improve in the Q4 2020.

**2.**  **Management Effectiveness**

 i.  ROA 

The Return on Assets on NVidia for 2020 was 0.61, dropped from 0.31 in 2019 showing the companys lack of efficiency in utilizing its assets to generate sales. 

 ii.  ROE

Similarly, the Return on Equity also decreased from 0.44 in 2019 to 0.23 in 2020. 

**3.**  **Liquidity Ratios**

&amp;#x200B;

Liquidity ratios show a companys both short term and long term cash requirements. Current ratio is slightly lower in 2020 compared to 2019. The 2020 is standing at a current ratio of 7.67 while the 2019 stood at 7.94. 

However, Quick Ratio for 2020 is significantly higher compared to 2019; with 2020 standing at a value of 7.13 while 2019 was 6.76. Quick ratio has improved, so overall we can draw a positive result. 

**4.**  **Stock Price History**

**Recommendation:**

A 12 month forecast of NVIDIA shows that the stock is estimated to top 700; a median of 600. **Aka CALLS CALLS CALLS.**  The median estimate showed a +10.2% increase from the last price of the stock at $544. Current analysis of NVIDIA shows a strong buy rating and the rating has been steady since November 2020. The companys PE ratio is below the average with a value of 88.98 which makes the stock undervalued; making the stock look even more attractive to Buy. Moreover, the companys cash flow has also improved as well as the liquidity position has improved. However, there are no massive threats that could potentially harm the companys profit margins in coming years and consensus regarding the performance are positive and a healthy margin is expected in near future. I would give a Super Fucking Buy recommendation of NVIDIA for the Q4 of 2020 and looks like the forecasts earnings will be outrun by the companys performance

Title: OPRX - small cap healthcare SaaS stock ready to explode
I recommended GRVY stock Thanksgiving week and it is up 31% since then. You can find it in my post history. So ignore this at your peril :)

OptimizeRx provides a platform that fills the communication gaps between drug manufacturers, health care providers, health care payers (insurance companies), and patients.

The OptimizeRx software integrates with most leading electronic health records ("EHR") platforms to provide its drug manufacturer customers a direct channel to about 60% of prescribing doctors and 66% of insured patients across the country.

OptimizeRx's customers get a wider sales base. And patients get access to better, cheaper medications.

Decades ago, most prescriptions were handwritten on tear-off pads. Today, 80% of medications are prescribed electronically. And this digital change is leading to better patient outcomes. Integrated within these electronic prescription systems, OptimizeRx's financial messaging product allows drug manufacturers to communicate with doctors and patients right at the point of care.

On average, this opportunity to place discounts and other co-pay offers directly into the physicians' EHR workflow lowers the costs for patients and thereby increases the chances the prescription will be filled. More than 75% of physicians conclude that access to these offers and co-pay information is "high value" for treating patients.

#### An Enterprise Shift

In addition to point-of-prescription financial messaging, OptimizeRx's newer offerings include clinical messaging, brand awareness, patient engagement, and a digital therapeutics platform. These offerings  particularly the therapeutics platform  enable the health care providers to do point-of-prescription research on treatment options in real time, potentially further optimizing health care outcomes.

What's more, the company is looking to expand its offerings further across not just certain drugs but entire drug *companies*. Historically, OptimizeRx offered its solutions  la carte to specific drug brands as opposed to the full companies  think the Lipitor unit within Pfizer (PFE), not Pfizer at the corporate level.

But management is changing its model, and that's what has us *really* interested...

The company is now converting clients from individual solutions and a volume-based model to something much better... an enterprise platform deal that offers each customer the full set of OptimizeRx solutions. This move will lead to stickier, more predictable revenue.

The company is one year into this transition, and it has already signed six enterprise deals worth $21 million in annualized revenue. Incredibly, CEO William Febbo stated on the third-quarter earnings call that **OptimizeRx is engaged with more than 100 brands on enterprise deals**.

With a current average of $3.5 million in annualized revenue per enterprise deal, 100 additional brands could represent $350 million in potential revenues. That's 10 times OptimizeRx's last 12 months of revenue and nearly equal to its total current market cap.

#### Land &amp; Expand

Those 100 potential brands didn't just appear out of nowhere for such a small company, OptimizeRx has a unique ability to get in front of new customers. This is because it already likely works with at least one brand from most Big Pharma companies. (It counts 80% of the top 50 pharma brands as customers.)

Chief Commercial Officer Stephen Silvestro explained what this looks like in practice...

&gt;We have one brand that's been a customer now for three years. This brand is an oncology brand. It was initially approved for one disease. \[It\] went and applied for indication extrapolation, which is essentially getting approval for more than one disease. And each one of those diseases creates a separate team within pharma to work on that brand.  
The initial brand was so pleased with the work that we did and the one solution, \[that it\] referred us to the second disease team. And then \[it\] referred us subsequently to the third and the fourth disease team. We now have seven diseases live with that one brand on that team.

This gives you an idea of the kind of organic growth runway OptimizeRx has. And management has stated it expects the pace of customer acquisition to increase in 2021 from its already-impressive levels.

#### The Kind of Business I Look For

OptimizeRx's business is scaling exactly how I would hope, getting better as it gets bigger.

Revenue growth is accelerating, and the company began generating positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA") in the third quarter. I expect a flip to true, bottom-line profitability and free cash flow ("FCF") generation in the fourth quarter. And operating expenses are holding steady, meaning we should see strong operating leverage as OptimizeRx continues to add new brands and grow its top line.

Additionally, OptimizeRx has $12 million in cash, virtually no debt, and a proven ability to execute on acquisitions. It acquired CareSpeak Communications in 2018, which spawned OptimizeRx's patient engagement solutions. And it acquired RMDY Health in 2019, which gave OptimizeRx its first true Software as a Service ("SaaS") product and is the foundation for its digital-therapeutics offerings.

As a reminder, I  and the market  like the SaaS model because it's "sticky" (meaning customers tend to renew their subscriptions year after year), has a strong margin profile, and is capital efficient.

Both deals were fairly material to OptimizeRx, so the company chose to spend 2020 digesting and integrating them, shifting its business model, and partnering with firms instead of acquiring them.

Now, OptimizeRx is in a great position to continue opportunistically acquiring assets to add to its platform. Bringing solutions in-house allows the company to continue expanding the scope of what it offers in its enterprise deals, thereby capturing more and more of the $20 billion-plus spent by pharma marketing to health care providers each year.

#### The Innovation Lab

Although mergers and acquisitions are solid options that add products to the platform quickly, OptimizeRx is also investing heavily in its own development. Through a partnership with electronic prescribing software NewCrop, OptimizeRx has built an "Innovation Lab" to let life sciences companies experiment with new solutions.

The innovation lab has already produced revenue-generating solutions, and its newest product  TelaRep  could be a major winner.

For decades, pharmaceutical companies have sent armies of salespeople to doctors' offices all over the country to educate (and sell) doctors on their drugs. As you might expect, doctors hate this dynamic: 60% of doctors' offices ban or limit drug representatives and the samples they offer. Plus, during COVID-19, this approach is near-impossible.

The TelaRep platform allows life science companies to communicate digitally with more than half of the health care providers in the U.S. Even better, TelaRep allows doctors to initiate the conversations *they* want to have on their own timeline and within their EHR workflows.

This product didn't exist six months ago, so it's too early to make any financial assumptions. But the use case is clear, and it gives you an idea of what OptimizeRx is capable of developing organically.

OptimizeRx checks virtually all the boxes I look for in a moonshot. It has a great business, a great model, and is the kind of company I expect to grow from a small player into a large-cap stock.

Title: IPOB undervalued IMO
Valued at less than 1.5B and being Zillows main competitor, has huge upside potential. Selling homes online is the future and I think this is just a matter of time before it catches wind and run up to 100$ a share.

Title: TROX is primed to 
***TL;DR*** - TROX's projected estimated growth per share is .0457. Something catastrophic has to happen to keep this stock from skyrocketing.

***Intro***

Hi all, ya'll might remember me from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6u2m2/thank_you_all_for_changing_my_life/). I made my money researching value stocks and buying a combination of calls and shares to minimize risk and maximize rewards. 

TROX has been one of my money makers. On 11/9, [I bought 2 $12 2/19 calls at $1.7.](https://puu.sh/GVq9K/44e6cdd8db.png) On 11/24, [I bought 3 more $12 2/19 calls at 1.85.](https://puu.sh/GVqbw/95e814e872.png). On 12/7, [I sold 1 call at 2.97](https://puu.sh/GVqdI/46c2031941.png), [3 $12 2/19 calls at 3.00](https://puu.sh/GVq92/3944c6aa44.png), and [1 call at 3.20](https://puu.sh/GVqea/dc08f11ac6.png). In one month, I made a 69.5% profit strictly on these calls.

Today, I am reinvesting in TROX and buying as many $16 5/21 calls and stocks at market open so I can .

***Company Data***

Tronox Holding PLC produces titanium products. [Titanium prices crashed around 2016 to $4,100 from a high of $16,700 in 2006.](https://puu.sh/GVqkX/c6c28bdd21.png) **Ever since then, the price of Titanium has been steadily going back up (!!!).**

**Price per Earning - 2.29x compared to an industry average of 104.47 (!!!)**

Price per Book - 1.35x compared to an industry average of 5.27

**Price per Earning Growth - .0457x (!!!!!) compared to an industry average of 1.01**

**Dividend Yield - 1.92% compared to 1.86 industry average. Most companies in the industry don't pay a dividend (!!!)**

***Personal Thoughts***

The value of this stock is insane. It has already recovered from the Corona crash and is up 20.73% to $14.62 from it's pre-Corona high of $12.11 this year and shows no signs of slowing down. It's earning growth is through the roof and I believe it will continue to do so as both the economy recovers and the price of Titanium recovers. I was originally happy with my initial profit, but after doing more research, I'm more than happy to jump back in for the long term and ride this ship to the moon.

As with all of my posts, please feel free to ask questions, critique, and analyze my comments. Regardless of how it goes, I will post an update on my position so we can analyze what went right/wrong.

Title: Big D DD
**The Great Bubble of 2020**  
&amp;nbsp;


We all know that the market is in a major bubble and we also all know that all bubbles pop eventually. The problem is that eventually can be a very long time. The [M2 money stock](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2) has been posted multiple times already but rarely are the [M1 stock](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1) and the [MZM stock.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MZM) MZM is the Money Zero Money stock and indicates the value of the M2 supply minus small denomination time deposits plus institutions. It gives us a better picture of what the big players are doing with their cash reserves that the M2 doesn't show. Combining all three [graphs](https://i.redd.it/lks874atux361.png) together show us the total inflation of money supply over time.  
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


**Why Do These Matter?**  
&amp;nbsp;


We can look at the major indices and see that they follow each other pretty accurately over time [raw](https://i.redd.it/zik8tmjbyx361.png) but to see it more cleanly, here's the same info against a [log scale.](https://i.redd.it/djsjckhwnx361.png) Now we can see that according to all of these charts that not only do stocks always go up, but we also have plenty of room for them to go up further. This is further supported by viewing [SPX/MZM](https://i.redd.it/578tch32ux361.png) and [SPX/M2.](https://i.redd.it/2ogvc8xcsx361.png) Now I can already hear you saying "but Prop, these graphs are the same thing. Why post the same thing twice?" The answer is that because the MZM shows institutional money supply and M2 doesn't, we might expect that these graphs shouldn't be the same. We can also look at the [SPX/M1.](https://i.redd.it/br1bw2e4xx361.png) Since we have a sharp drop off at the end there we can interpret that as people moving liquidity into savings or other assets.  
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


**How Housing Plays In**  
&amp;nbsp;

 
If you've been living under a rock you probably don't know that on Dec 31st the [forebearacne provision of the CARES act ends.](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/mortgage-relief/) What does that mean for us? Looking at the [mortgage delinquency rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRSFRMACBS) we can see that come Jan 1st, we're going to potentially have a slew of bankruptcies as homeowners get foreclosed upon. For those of you who've seen The Big Short, you'll know that mortgage backed securities are still widely used and how it doesn't take high percentages of defaults to detonate them. The problem the first time was giving mortgages to people who wouldn't qualify for a payday loan. This time, the ineffective measures taken by the gov mean many otherwise credit worthy individiuals are now sub-prime, through no fault of their own.  
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


**Why This Falls Apart**  
&amp;nbsp;


Now that we've got some background info. We can look at the [buffett indicator](https://i.redd.it/8g9mhit24y361.png) to see that the equity markets are insanely overvalued. Here's where hard data stops and my conjecture starts. We currently have a market heated to dot-com levels. That by itself doesn't mean anything. We didn't have the fed actively screwing with the bond market then. JPOW and presumably Janet Yellen remain committed to infinite QE to protect busisness from the slightest risk of bankruptcy. What they can't do is give money directly to people. This creates the situation where we have a K-shaped recovery actively happening. It works great, as long as average people can service their debt. The problem comes in on Jan 1st when the insulation of the CARES act ends and Congress currently doesn't seem interested in getting another round of stimulus going. 
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


**What Does That Mean For The Market?**  
&amp;nbsp;


If Congress doesn't see fit to bestow upon the plebs some Trump/Biden bux we can see that we'll likely see widespread housing defaults/foreclosures. Most people don't like to be homeless, especially in winter, so anyone who's in that situation who also has stock holdings would be highly motivated to sell to afford to pay their now urgent mortgage. The MBSs securitizing these mortgages will crumble if enough households fail to raise the cash to pay off their loan as a result. This can be entirely averted if stimmy happens and even if it doesn't, it's unlikely that all of this will happen before late Feb-March. It won't be a fast process by any means and Congress could end it at any time by getting their act together and passing something.
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


**TL/DR**  
&amp;nbsp;


Housing fucked, market fucked, don't buy puts yet though.

Title: Board the rocket that is *VXRT*
So here is some DD from myself. Myself being an admitted amateur, but knows how to read patterns and news when I see it. Tired of seeing the word PLTR? Well, in a short couple of months you may get tired of seeing VXRT.

**What is VXRT?**

Vaxart, Inc., a clinical-stage biotechnology company, engages in the discovery and development of oral recombinant protein vaccines based on its proprietary oral vaccine platform. The company's product pipeline includes norovirus vaccine, an oral tablet vaccine, which has completed Phase I clinical trials with bivalent oral tablet vaccine for the GI.1 and GII.4 norovirus strains; seasonal influenza vaccine, which is in Phase II clinical trials for treatment of H1 influenza infection; respiratory syncytial virus vaccine; and coronavirus vaccine. It is also developing therapeutic immune-oncology vaccines for cervical cancer and dysplasia caused by human papillomavirus. The company has a research collaboration agreement with Janssen Vaccines &amp; Prevention B.V. (Janssen) to evaluate the company's proprietary oral vaccine platform for the Janssen universal influenza vaccine program. Vaxart, Inc. is headquartered in South San Francisco, California. 

&amp;#x200B;

**YTD History**

VXRT was a penny stock coming into the new year and quickly found its feet mid summer rocketing up to 15 per share, 5 dollar short of its 5 YR ATH in 2016. VXRT has been trading relatively sideways for the past couple of weeks and is teetering on being an interplanetary rocket that soars well past the moon. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My Research and Thoughts**

VXRT will be offering among many other vaccines, and ORAL COVID-19 vaccine. That's right, oral. Now, Why is this huge you might ask? Well for starters the current vaccines are sensitive to specific temperatures and makes transportation ,storage, and administration a large hurdle. With a pill form it can be distributed en mass, globally, in any regular package. This not only relieves staffing issue to administer a vaccine on such a grand scale, but also allows many people that have a huge fear of needles to take it in an oral form. 

The company is getting ready to publish phase 1 trials and finding with word of this happening around December 10. They recently hired a team of 5 manufacturing experts and have quality control expert job openings, which to me signals a need for an all hands on deck operation for when the manufacturing officially starts soon. Vaxart will be the first company to actually bring out mucosal immunity. 

There are grumblings of a **Bill Gates** connection with a new Stanford hire at VXRT. If you dig deep enough, things start to get pretty interesting. Pfizer also recently came out and said that they would have trouble with initial demand for the vaccine and might not have enough till summer of 2021, in turn allowing other major players to enter the market and crush. Joe Biden said it himself, 

 ***Cost of actually getting the serum into an injection needle into someones arm costs a lot of money. It takes a lot of people. It takes a lot of folks to get this done. We have to have a much better way than what we have seen to get this distributed.*** 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is some nice DD from someone I have no affiliation with but backs up my thoughts: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuofzQ73An0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuofzQ73An0)

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**

There is risk. But this risk will pay off. A pill form vaccine is going to take us to the moon. Once funding is secured my bets are on a moon past 30 by first quarter.

Title: URANIUM + EVs = TENDIES
Alright everyone, we all know we're in the midst of an EV Goldrush. EV SPACs as far as the eye can see and tendies for everyone involved.

Sensei Elon Musk knows this and has mentioned that we're going to need **DOUBLE** the amount of energy by 2040. Like Best\_trades in his post (tagged below) explains, nuclear energy is the most viable **green** energy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;"Its clear that electric cars will have a huge impact on battery metals  but not many investors realise the impact they will have on demand for uranium.  
&gt;  
&gt;Electric vehicles (or EVs) will becharged from mains power around the clock, dramatically increasingpowerdemandfromthe electricitygrid in coming years.  
&gt;  
&gt;Nuclear power is expected to play a crucial role fulfilling that demand as the world goes searching for reliable, low-carbon electricity."

&amp;#x200B;

So how do we get in on this nuclear energy you ask? 

U R A N I U M.

The sector is so small and so undervalued that when big pockets start to invest, this sector will fly. I believe that even though there was a small pop, it's still quite under the radar when it comes to EV mania.

And just to add to all of the green energy/EV hype, The US government has just passed a bill establishing a strategic reserve of Uranium. AKA all the Uranium mining companies just hit the jackpot. 

&amp;#x200B;

    "Mining.com reported over the weekend, the Senate's Committee on Environment and Public Works has just approved a bipartison bill aimed at establishing a U.S. national strategic reserve of uranium. The prospect of government funds being spent to acquire large amounts of the nuclear fuel sent shares of uranium mining stocks sharply higher today."

&amp;#x200B;

There are several Uranium Mining companies but none of them can hold a green candle to Energy Fuels, or \[**U** **U U U**\]

**First**, they're debt free. Unlike the majority.

**Second**, They're the leading producer in the USA.

**Third**, they just started producing REE in November. So there's that. 

&amp;#x200B;

They're also currently trading under 3.00. THINK OF THE ROOM TO GROW.

 

TLDR: Own an EV stock? BUY URANIUM STOCK. USA govt just passed a bill requiring a national reserve of it/Price is going to rocket thanks to the EV revolution's battery needs. The best company with highest growth potential is Energy Fuel Inc, or \[**U U U U**\]

Title: Next Meme Stock: Genetic Therapeutics
Why is TSLA at 600 billion market cap? Investing has changed. Growth is the new currency of the realm. EVERY SINGLE meme stock is a meme stock because it has extraordinary growth potential. The companies that are going to really change the world are genetic therapy companies. They have cured genetic blindness, have a promising cure for sick cell anemia. The director of national intelligence says China is testing genetic therapy on their soldiers to make them super soldiers. Beauty is an 800 billion dollar market that may be disrupted because people buy gene therapies to make themselves look pretty instead of makeup or something. It is probably going to be a front in a Cold War between USA and China. Genetic therapy companies are the next meme stocks because of the growth they have. As more people realize this, the price will  because like I said investing is based on growth now.

Title: GME is undervalued cuz price to sales ratio
Autists, former gay bears like myself, and fellow degenerates:

GME is undervalued as fuck. 

After repenting from my gay bearish ways and STILL loosing money after buying PLTR calls at ATH (still in the hole for that for some magical reason), I decided to look at the PS ratio and discovered the following:

    PS ratios:
    
    PLTR:
    mkt cap= 45bn
    revenue = 1bn
    PS ratio = 45
    growth = 45%?
    
    Zoom
    mkt cap: 115bn
    revenue = 622m
    PS ratio = 72
    
    Google
    mkt cap: 1200Bn
    revenue : 160bn
    PS ratio = 7.5
    annual revenue growth: 18%
    
    TSLA
    mkt cap: 500bn
    revenue: 20bn
    PS = 25
    
    GME:
    mkt cap: 1.0B
    revenue: 6bn
    PS ratio: 0.2

I'm looking at price-to-sale (PS) because no self-respecting meme stock makes any earnings therefore PE is moot, but revenue exists (unless you're NKLA, in which case you're a special type of autist)

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GME HAVING 6x the revenue at 1/45th the market cap of PLTR.

The above, plus the short squeeze possibility, healthy debt levels, and cash on hand - should precipitate, your GME shares into exploding, along with your balls. Yes, yes, some of those other companies have "growth"; just put that shit aside and don't think too much into it for just 20 hours until ER. 

Position: 200 GME shares + some weird ass put spread I sold that I duno how the fuck it works

TLDR: buy GME shares

$BB Just when you least expect it BB is going to get a nice BONUS payment in the amount of hundreds of millions from the cucks at $FB and $SNAP from the patent infringement lawsuit.  

News out tonight! 

outline.com/vgfUSG

"Judge Reyna seemed to think that at least on some of the patents, the lower court might have been a bit too harsh, particularly the patents that helped people find when events were happening near them, eliminating the need to switch back and forth between multiple apps.

"Why wouldn't the absence or the non-requirement of so much toggling be an improvement in computer functionality?" he asked.

The judge pressed Snap Inc. on the matter, asking counsel for the photo messaging app whether the company was arguing "that there is no technical advancement or improvement at all or that there's some but not enough."

Title: Next Meme Stocks: CRSP &amp; EDIT
Meme stocks are meme because they are based on a societies values. We WANT electric vehicles, so TSLA moons. We WANT space travel, so SPCE moons. The next thing we will want to to genetically modify our selves. A 800 billion beauty industry disrupted. Trillions will come from curing genetic diseases. This is UNDOUBTEDLY the future, as its obvious electric self driving vehicles are the future. TSLA went up for years before they were profitable. Genetic therapy is going to change everything. These will become meme stocks, and soon. 

6 month calls and these companies.

Title: $SAIL Is the next big tech play
Cyber security is hot right now.  I work with a lot of big enterprise clients and it is the #1 priority for all of them

Yes we have heard of ZS, CRWD, OKTA etc who have all done their mooning

but there is one cybersecurity that slowly creeping up.  Sailpoint

whats sail point?

SailPoint is an open-source Identity Governance platform that gives the organization the power to create an identity-enabled enterprise by combining Data, Device &amp; Applications.

Providing a trusted solution to deliver Operational Efficiency, Security, &amp; Compliance to the business.

Think okta but more focus on governance

On the cusp of breaking ATH right now, this low key tech play is about to moon or be bought out

position 60c March 2021 @1.90 - these are STUPID cheap right now

Title: Why you should Short DOORTRASH
I worked for Doordash for nearly two years. I didn't get fired, and this post will be solid DD about how their business operations are dogshit, not me whining because I was underpaid or let go(tho I was underpaid).

**1) The fucking network goes down constantly, their tech is trash**

Go read /r/doordash_drivers or any other employee sub. AT LEAST once per month, on a Friday or Saturday night, the ENTIRE network goes down for at least 1 hour. What happens when the entire network goes down? All restaurants still have to be paid for the food they made, and all orders have to be refunded to customers, who also demand refunds because their tendies were late. Yes, sometimes companies shit is fucked, Facebook has an outage sometimes too. But it happens to Doordash constantly, BEFORE COVID doubled their order volume.

Regarding their tech - here's how the process is supposed to work.

1)You punch in an order for tendies.

2) The restaurant gets a little ping on their tablet saying "Order? Ya takin this brah?" (or, LMFAO, the Doordash CALL CENTER CALLS THE ORDER INTO THE RESTAURANT, YES, THEY REALLY DO THIS)

3) The restaurant clicks accept and starts making the food.

4) The Doordash Network does the travelling salesman optimization poorly and offers the order to drivers.

5) A driver accepts

6) The restaurant hits a "confirmed rdy" button and the driver, notified via text message comes in an picks it up.

At EVERY single point in this process, with regularity, I would see evidence that the Doordash system sent the process forward without confirmations. If a restaurant didn't turn their tablet on that morning? Doesn't matter, I'm at the restaurant now asking about an order that they never knew they had, but SOMEHOW confirmed it was ready - despite having a tablet with a dead battery. I'd have my phone in one hand with the "Order Ready For Pickup at Tendie Shop" text message in one hand, and be holding the restaurant's dead tablet in my other hand.

Customers would call me, two seconds after I left the store having hit "Picked Up", asking me where I was, because the app told them I was outside.

What happens when their network delivers confirmation notifications that are lies? Lost money.

Uber has algorithms that automatically price rides and orders. The price changes with demand. What does Doordash do? Charge the same for every order, and pay drivers "boosts" in minimum increments of a half hour. So what happens is every Friday or Saturday night, there will be a "2$ boost" on all orders from 5pm-9pm. But let's say the system is still saturated at 6pm - then they add a boost from 6pm-9pm for another dollar. But if it dies at 7pm, they can't take the boost off. And if it's overloaded on a Sunday, they basically never add one no matter what. I suspect this is because they don't have an algorithm, they have people they pay to look at network data live and make decisions (poorly).

**2) They don't know how to run a fucking business**

Repeatedly, I would be placed in situations where the simple and proper customer service thing to do was A, but because it saved half a dollar in the short run, I did B and fucked the customer over, because Doordash wouldn't pay me to do A.

Here's an example. New Year's Eve, 230am. I get a double order from a Chinese restaurant. One going way North, one going way South. I live North past the North order, gonna go home after.

The way double orders work is that drivers get paid a little less, because it's only one pick up. No problem, that's fair!

I get to the Chinese place. They have North order ready, but not South order. They say it will be 30 minutes for South order.

I call Doordash support (more on them in a moment). I explain that the next customer's order will be delayed.

Here are the possible outcomes :

A) Out of the kindness of my heart, I waste my gas (and miss out on pay!) to make North Customer happy, I deliver his order right now, and then come back and get South Customer's order.

B) I sit there for 30 minutes and let North Customer's order get (c)old because they won't pay me extra to deliver it separately, even though it's now two orders.

What do you think happened? They wouldn't pay me. I'm an "independent contractor", I don't run a fucking Doordash customer charity. North Customer's order got cold. I'm sure he bitched and complained rightfully, and Doordash had to refund his food. Doordash saved 6$ by not paying me, only to probably lose this customer and lose the order's revenue anyways.

Let's talk about support now. Every single restaurant I ever talked to regarding support would make me call about any issue, because the Restaurant Support line ALWAYS had a minimum 30 minute hold wait. They just didn't give a shit.

I've dealt with Uber, DD, Instacart, lots of different support callcenters for this shit. DD hires the Phillipinos that don't speak english well enough to work at the Uber call centre. I would have to hang up 1/5 times I called and call again, because the person I got could not fucking understand what I was saying. I don't have some kind of weird speech impediment either I s2g.

Their support are total idiots too. Here's a good one.

I try to deliver Chinese to some people. I hear loud music in their apartment. I knock ten times over 5 minutes. I text them twice. I call them three times in the same period. They won't come to the door.

I leave and go do the next order. Support calls me back, says hey, can you go deliver that order? They said they're sorry. I said sure, i'm only a few blocks away anyways.

I go back, same shit happens again, they don't come to the door. I leave again. Support calls me again 20 minutes later, I say this time I'm not going back unless they pay me extra, I've been back once for free already. Support says sure, we'll give you 5$.

I go back, and deliver the food. This time, they come to the door to get it, and the most obviously fucking spun up meth-head i've ever seen comes to the fucking door. I tell support "Yo, you should ban these ppl from the app, they're high as fuck and wasting my time". Support says "That's a good idea, it says here they say their order didn't get delivered like half the time, probably scamming".

Next week? I get an order from the same Chinese place to the same address, apartment number and all pop up in my app. Declined, so no problem for me. But DD? You can't ban cracked out scam artists who cost you money?

I could go on and on. Essentially in most instances, Doordash support fails to protect the long term interests of the company, which screws over good customers and lets scam artistry run rampant.

My friends are all hipster foodie millennials and Doortrash has the reputation among ALL OF THEM as the least reliable app, where the app doesn't work, their food goes missing or ends up 3hrs late for no reason. Nobody likes it.

**Doordash is what happens when someone starts a competitor, hoping to get bought out, and then they never get bought. Corona happens and they decide "oh, maybe we can IPO then and that's how we get rich and get out of this mess?"**

TL;DR SHORT DOORTRASH

Positions, all stock, will be shorting DD with my GME profits soon enough.

Title: IPO WEEK: ABCL (AbCellera)
Good evening autists,

I see there hasn't been a single ABCL thread and I'm here to change that. If you want the deep DD and to dig deep into their technology, see: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1703057/000119312520299507/d29983ds1.htm

I know most of you have the attention span of a goldfish and you might never understand AbCellera's tech so here's the tl;dr:

-Palantir founder Peter Thiel is on the board and has stake in the company. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-abcellera-board-thiel/peter-thiel-joins-board-of-antibody-therapy-developer-abcellera-idUSKBN27Z2J3

-Working with Eli Lilly on Covid antibody treatment, Eli Lilly has a stake. https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/abcellera-tapped-by-lilly-for-its-covid-antibody-therapy-sets-ipo-terms-5b-valuation

-They make money speeding up drug research, the runway is massive and they aren't limited to one area of expertise like a standard biotech.

From Bloomberg: "AbCellera screens, selects, and analyzes millions of naturally produced antibodies to find next-generation drug candidates, fast tracking an otherwise lengthy and cumbersome process with machine learning and data science. Aside from Thiel, the Vancouver-based companys backers include German entrepreneur Christian Angermayer, Viking Global Investors and health-care investment firm OrbiMed Advisors LLC."

"According to information presented to potential investors, AbCellera has been cash flow positive every year since inception and has shown an annual revenue growth rate of 100% over the past five years."
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-19/peter-thiel-is-said-to-get-board-seat-at-abcellera-as-ipo-nears

There's your over 100% YoY revenue growth to get the growth Momo crowd on board.

We got Covid antibodies, Peter Thiel, AI, rapid growth, and nearly unlimited partnership opportunities.

Title: WISH IPO: A giant in the making.
For those of you unfamiliar with the company, wish.com is the third largest e-commerce website in the United States and it has the most-downloaded shopping app in the world. 

Since 2018, the companys revenue has more than doubled as it has perfected its targeted ad systems that tailors each social media ad to the customer its targeting. This is the reason for the ultra-specific ads you may be familiar with which cater to your profession, hobbies, interest, etc.

As of now the market is flooded with e-commerce sites like Amazon, which has the logistics market cornered, and Alibaba, which thrives on economies of scale. Wish.com brings its own unique benefit to the market, and that is in its proprietary ad-targeting algorithm, which operates similarly to the blockbuster app TikTok in providing content which targets the specific needs of the buyer.

I believe this factor alone sets Wish ahead of most of the e-commerce marketplace and could place them in the top three holders of global market share by 2025. 
In an inescapable age of information, information will continue to be the most valuable tool in securing buyers, and Wish has everyone beat in that department as of now.

I see this as an opportunity to get in on an Amazon or 
Alibaba initial offering. 

Before I go any further, I believe I should highlight that this is *NOT* a meme stock and its not more empty promises as weve seen in recent mergers and IPOs. I think this is best evidenced by the players involved in this offering. The management of this company are not from retail backgrounds and this is not a retail company. At least not exactly. CEO Peter Szulczewski is an engineer from Google who **wrote the algorithm** keyword search expansion. After leaving Google, he wrote an algorithm that analyzes browsing behavior to determine buying interests. When he realized how effective this algorithm was at suggestive selling, he put together a team including Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman and Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang. All this is to say that Wish is not just a retail company.

**Wish.coms main product is not goods its buyers**

I see the most difficult hurdle for Wish to cross as supply chain logistics. Since independent sellers can list items on the marketplace, questionable practices often take place with regard to quality of goods and shipment. Wish has made advancements with regard to shipping including and agreement between China Post and the USPS, but they are way behind Amazon in their shipping infrastructure. This is in part due to their reputation as a low-cost marketplace preventing them from investing in high-cost shipping. This issue will need to be resolved for them to become competitive on a global scale.

Lastly, Wish has established itself not only as a major player in the global market but as a stock that is here to stay. Reinvestments into infrastructure, alongside groundbreaking advancements in the science of targeting advertisements puts Wish on the forefront of global commerce. The foundation is there, but the company has tremendous shoes to grow into.  

Heres my prediction for the stock:

I believe the initial public offering will be the largest of this year, AirBNB included. I think as the funds become available, and if their worldwide shipping and customer service infrastructure are improved sufficiently, Wish could see a swift rise to become a household with few peers in market capitalization. Potentially one of the next trillion-dollar market cap stocks. I will be investing heavily at IPO. See you there.

Title: PLTR still strong
  

PLTR DD

Starting point**:** 

**RECENT EVENT REACTION**: Palantir's traction with large government contracts, such as its recent $44 million order with U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Covid-19 treatment approvals, could be a sign the company is finding success with expanding uses of its products beyond defense, terrorism threats, cybersecurity and fraud detection. Still, customer concentration and lack of a cloud-based subscription model could limit Palantir's revenue-growth visibility beyond 2021. (12/08/20)

1. Palantir: Company Outlook THESIS: Palantir's software use for contact tracing and supply-chain analysis during the pandemic could be a tailwind for top-line growth and new-customer additions in the near-term. While the company's addressable-market view remains clouded by its lack of a partner ecosystem and reliance on large government customers for sales, we believe Palantir's proprietary datasets and shortening deployment times could help broaden its potential uses and diversify the customer base. Investments in building direct services 

**Valuation Unlikely** to Match Cloud IPOs Palantir is unlikely to garner a valuation similar to pure-play cloud-software IPOs, which averaged a 65% gain in their public-market debuts. While the company has strong intellectual property, built around the use of big data for its analytics offering, we believe its top-line growth in the $26.5 billion analytics tools software market could be limited by growing competition from stand-alone providers such as Tableau (bought by Salesforce.com) and Qlik, as well as hyperscale-cloud peers including Microsoft's Power BI and Amazon AWS. Palantir's lack of a partner ecosystem limits its operating-margin expansion, in our view. The company's multi-class voting structure, with a majority of voting rights for its co-founders, and a lack of customer diversification could hurt institutional interest. (09/29/20)

However in my report of PLTR I strongly believe that it has the momentum for the next quarter to strongly outperform the news and it could be traded at an overvalued price for much longer, and because of this short term profits could be made on this investment. 

Fundamental 

[Figure 1 ](https://preview.redd.it/g6m3pl14yu361.jpg?width=736&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=318c5c280ec41cd92ab20d6abe9e360779e92eb6)

We can see that in the sector that they are in they are performing better than the competition in terms of sales Their EBIT is quite high and their p/e rate is lower than the competition. If we look at the recent sales and buys done we can see that the rate of institution ownership went up quite a bit. This is in fact good news for us. And we can see growth from here.

[Figure 2 ](https://preview.redd.it/xhxbebu9yu361.jpg?width=736&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ebe37d79b17578b839301d986f93ba44bf2b463)

&amp;#x200B;

a) The operating income is almost double in loss but this should not discourage the prediction because its a new IPO and they are using their money to grow their operations so this would be expected. The total debt increased however this is also due to the rapid growth of the company and them expanding 

**What does the company do?** 

Data analytics is their prime focus since IPO earlier this year they have +160% after announcing their FDA response and the company working with news on working with Greece with their covid-19 response they have gained 20% today The stock is up big on Monday after the company reportedly won a new FDA contract to use Palantir software to help the agency conduct drug reviews. The software will help the FDA with drug approvals, including potential COVID-19 treatments.

Palantir CEO Alex Karp also joined Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis on a teleconference to discuss Palantir's partnership with Greece to support COVID-19 response efforts. Since the start of the pandemic, Palantir has worked with the Greek government to help guide decisions on how to best deal with the crisis.

[figure 3 ](https://preview.redd.it/2vdjxgnfyu361.jpg?width=736&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e8790bf83fbfcbcdd5d52e0c5f550a84d2b07c8)

**The ownership** 

of institutions is up by 2% and the # of buys is up by 100% indicating to us that the market is deciding to go long on this stock. These are all bullish indicators and tell us a story; a story of going to the moon. 

b) Other investments made to the company are all up and long on the stock. 

c) This shows us the ownership of the company. 

[Figure 4 ](https://preview.redd.it/cazcwwclyu361.jpg?width=736&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=803bbd3c253b0bfe0b5604523637c3743b5f456a)

**Insider Purchase sales** 

We can see at the rally 2 weeks ago that insider selling was high this could indicate to us that there where massive sell off however as I previously mentioned there is momentum to the stock and that the news of many insider selloffs didnt effect the rally tells us that this stock has the potential to go even higher. I would suggest that these sell offs where purely psychological and they where done by people that invested their money since the company IPO mostly from within the company so this does not indicate to us that the price would go down. 

[Figure 5 ](https://preview.redd.it/43m30xvnyu361.jpg?width=736&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4f00fabf1feb1fae7ae70ba746ebc417bc95316)

&amp;#x200B;

**Sells of PLTR** 

The majority of the institution holders were selling at the rally last week. However, they didnt sell completely and decreased their position size. This is just because its part of their trading strategy and when there is a rally that big in order to hedge the massive investments they have to do a partial sell ofs of their position. They would eventually buy back in at the next rally because there is just enough momentum to keep the stock going higher( they are just buying the dips) 

[figure 5 ](https://i.redd.it/3y755zdryu361.gif)

 

**Earings report** predictions say that the earings are matched with the stock growth and this should b an indicator that the company is performing in touch with reality and that it is not that overvalued at this point of time and that the extrinsic value that is brought to us by the recent news would rally this stock higher. 

Operating profit to stock price.

**Supply Chain** 

https://preview.redd.it/hvrg8mmxyu361.jpg?width=1919&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=150a5a22517d1c0e760b87a731d0cb818b92bdb3

In the supply chain of PLTR 

We can see that their top 10 competitors are doing similar in their sector and that their majority customer is the US government which makes them a reliable source because they have unlimited money :P so they would pay regardless. This supply chain is fairly simple however it creates a better foundation for the companies foundation. 

In short, I think that the PLTR has more room for growth and we can expect $40-45 by end of Q1 and I am in a long bullish position for this company, 

Position C$45/03/21

Title: $VALE and $TSLA Partnership
A majority of people think about electric cars and charging stations but they do not consider the manufacturing aspect of it. More demand for electric battery=more nickel production. 

$VALE is the #1 leading company in nickel and metals production. Which is an essential material when it comes to manufacturing electric vehicles.

[Miner $Vale in talks with $TSLA](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mining-canada-vale-sa/miner-vale-in-talks-with-tesla-ev-sector-for-canada-nickel-executive-idUSKBN26N3HH)

"Tesla CEO Elon Musk in July urged miners to produce more nickel, a key ingredient in the batteries that power the companys electric cars. Musk offered a giant contract if supplies could be produced in an environmentally sensitive way." 

"Tesla and other automakers need to ensure there is sufficient nickel available to produce the number of batteries required for EVs over the next five to eight years, Mark Travers, Vales executive director of base metals, told Reuters." 

"Asked whether Vale and Tesla have held discussions, Travers said: Yes, absolutely. 

[Vale CFO on Credit Upgrade, Tesla Talks, China](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKVNGhYPxfo&amp;ab_channel=BloombergMarketsandFinance)

\-I know that this is a LONG time. But $VALE has been going up a couple of months and premiums are still dirt cheap. I got a couple of calls (16.0 12/18/2020 and 16.5 01/22/2020) and shares. Will be adding more.

Title: Toyota is finally joining the EV Party
Toyota is developing an electric SUV for Europe. They confirmed that the vehicle is being reading for production. They are building this from the ground up, so they are already ahead of companies like NKLA. I believe that theyve already released an EV in China with joint venture with Panasonic. Toyota has been making hybrid (partially electric) vehicles for around 20 years so I would think that that gives them a foundation to build from for their EV sector. 

Source: https://electrek.co/2020/12/07/toyota-electric-suv-battery-electric-cars/

Toyotas vehicles are reliable and their stock price is not ridiculously high. I could see this EV venture giving their stock price a boost, just like the announcement of GMs hummer gave them a rise. Personally Id buy an EV from Toyota rather than GM because of my faith in their products.

Title: Why settle for KNDI, when you can have TENDIES?
Alright listen up dipshits, prepare for the gayest bear DD youve ever attempted to read but stopped halfway through because there was a four-syllable word.

TLDR: KNDI is a circle-jerk scam of Chinese meme gods that is bound to leave a bukkake-sized load on the face of the EV industry before its delisted and the execs are sent to gulags.

Position: $5P exp 6/18/21. Enter when the stock is between 10-11 and expect to average down until these motherfuckers are pocket change. Then wait.

Now, before the actual DD, I implore you to simply google what KNDIs product is. It looks like the minivan and a Smart Car were somehow cousins and KNDI is the autistic offspring. And you retards think this has a shot against all the cybertrucks this sub is going to run them over with? Good luck. Id take TSLAQ level losses on this play before you could pay me to cash out on a KNDI vehicle with my tendies.

Im going to be upfront, if youre interested in this play, read the Hindenburg Research reports. This dd is moreso about the feasibility of KNDI in scaling, which presents significant risk to investors, which given that they havent been able to raise a market cap at all yet, means they never will.
The number one claim to fame this stock has is that it made the cheapest EV. Cool. Its almost like the Chinese didnt yet have a reputation for flooding the American market with cheap goods. The problem with that business model in this application, is that it has to present a feasible alternative to its competition. And if you think for a single fucking second that this company can compare with Meme Lord Elon, youre an even gayer bear than I am. 
So in addition to not being able to sell to American consumers, it appears they cant even sell to Chinese consumers either. Essentially, its extremely likely that their balance sheets and revenue are completely fraudulent, and that the execs of the company have literally just been buying their own cars and counting it as sales. The reasoning for fraud is that the company has been through three auditors already, and one of them is banned from ever auditing in China again after fucking up harder than you retards fumble earnings calls.

Summary: Making dirt-cheap products with negative margin, cooking the books on sales, and pocketing stacks off of Murican investors pulling for hype over fundamentals. Sounds like its going to the moon to me.

Title: People who sold shovels during the Gold Rush made more tendies than those looking for gold!! IDEX $3 C 4/16/21
The title isnt super related to this DD but this quote always resonated with my smooth brain. 

I see the meme stocks right now as the gold rush in California. 

Retarded toothless hillbillies (including myself) left their wives boyfriends, and flocked in droves for the promise of finding gold. 

FOMO caused everyone to rush and mine. The people who actually made money, took advantage of the migration and played the reaction (not the news). 

They started selling shovels, mesh, dynamite etc... anything that could lead to a golden nugget no bigger than my 2 tallywhacker. 


As a retard, I am now switching my stance on meme stocks because I am well... retarded. 

I started investing in viable companies in the same industries as our beloved meme stonks (EV, tech). 

I wasnt looking for electric vehicle stocks necessarily, but rather Automotive parts that could be used in AV/EV (the shovels). Things such as sensors for self driving cars, electric Tractors, etc... I most recently have focused on LIDAR companies as AVs are more imperative than ever. 

These are all viable (shovel) companies that can see boosts once we see a bigger integration of EVs. 

If youre like me, (poor male, mid 20s, with a porn addiction) you probably dont have daddys money each week to throw at TSLA fds. 

So now that Ive wasted hella keystrokes with this dumbass analogy, I need you all to do your own research on IDEX cuz my boss just messaged me on teams and Im hiding in the shitter.

Title: $FCX  I am Copper Man   literally golden-orange tendies!
######Copper in Tech:
 
Electrical-based technology is the future; and electrical technology requires copper.
 
Just look to Teslas 10% gain in share price today and profit numbers last quarter (surpassing expectations).
 
Tesla is not an auto company  it is a *technology* company, involved with a spectrum of industries: automotive, space, electronics, high-speed transportation, solar power, among others.
 
And Tesla is just one firm of many in the tech space  this is seen in the NASDAQ, for example, which up nearly 50% in the past year *alone*! The tech sector is experiencing growth at an *astounding* pace.
 
With all this technology and need for copper  its no surprise that Copper is approaching its highest prices since January 2011!
 
And where will this COPPER *come from*??
 
######Enter Freeport-McMoRan ($FCX) :
 
$FCX is an American-based mining firm  one of the largest producers of copper in the world.
 
The fact that $FCX is American is important. A majority of $FCXs mines are in the USA (9 out of 13). With global tensions between China and USA running high, it is anticipated that copper sourced and purchased locally may provide major benefits to American tech firms in the future. For example, tariffs on foreign metals may be implemented if China-USA tensions continue  making American copper that much more enticing to both investors and enterprises alike. China poses a major threat: over the past decade they have ramped up precious earth metal mining to record levels. US Government way put in place new laws to help incentivize American mining firms like $FCX to also expand their mining practices. $FCX would be a prime benefactor of a government policy move, should one take place.
 
There is no doubt that $FCX will be a huge player in the Copper mining/distribution in the future  and this is made dramatically clear in the growth of its stock price: Up 50% in past 3 months, Up 125% in past 6months!
 
Current price: $FCX = $24.60

Title: $FCX  I am Copper Man   it is literally orange gold!
######Copper in Tech:
 
Electrical-based technology is the future; and electrical technology requires copper.
 
Just look to Teslas 10% gain in share price today and profit numbers last quarter (surpassing expectations).
 
Tesla is not an auto company  it is a technology company, involved with a spectrum of industries: automotive, space, electronics, high-speed transportation, solar power, among others.
 
And Tesla is just one firm of many in the tech space  this is seen in the NASDAQ, for example, which up nearly 50% in the past year alone! The tech sector is experiencing growth at an astounding pace.
 
With all this technology and need for copper  its no surprise that Copper is approaching its highest prices since January 2011.
 
And where will this COPPER come from??

**Comments:** DMG CEO Dan Reitzik is actually someone I really respect because even though BTC is at an all time high, Dan won't just go randomly purchase a bunch of miners. Dan will look at their corporate cash flow and figure out what will be the best long term because of BTC crazy ups and downs. Currently, DMG will be hosting HIVE ([https://www.hiveblockchain.com/](https://www.hiveblockchain.com/)) future miners which will provide additional cash flow to DMG's revenue stream. DMG having the ability to buy power from both US/CANADA depending on pricing can give  DMG a better leverage in the market for overall operational cost. This company is a **BUY**.

Title: This is the way to play Tesla (up 55.8% TODAY with this dumb strategy!)
Elon Musk says we need to double the world's electricity by 2040. How is that going to happen--Solar? No. Wind? No. 

The only way to ramp up base-load capacity so quickly is more natural gas, coal, or nuclear plants.  Natgas and coal are out because they aren't green. Nuclear is the best option.

Here's the quick and dirty DD:

To get nuclear plants going, we need to mine uranium. Uranium stocks have roofed the last two trading sessions because congress just passed a bill to start a US stockpile of the stuff for national security purposes. The scramble to get mines operational has begun, but that's only the trigger that will set off a much longer rally based on industry-specific factors. 

The fact is, the world is set to go into a decade-long drawdown of uranium inventories. Despite the Fukushima disaster last decade, nuclear capacity will continue to grow year after year, but mines aren't keeping up. That's going to set the price of uranium soaring, from around $30 per pound today, to $50 or even more, so that mines actually get paid to produce.

Uranium mining companies like Cameco (CCJ in the US exchange and CCO in Canada) are levered to the price of uranium, so that when the uranium price rises, the stock prices rise even more. And with options, idiots like us at WSB can be levered on top of that leverage. The daily gains can be explosive. 

That's how I made 55.8% today: options on CCJ. See the screenshot. A good chunk of these options were out of the money when I bought them, but now they're all in the money. What can I say--sometimes the idiots at WSB do win! I should have bought even further out of the money, like CCJ 14 Jan 21 calls, given the pace the underlying is currently moving. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xtck2tbemt361.png?width=1904&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bab84530589236a3225b9443cbdb815a3de2041e

TL;DR: buying call options in CCJ is for people who believe in Musk but want to park their TSLA gains in something with more upside.

Title: AZN and FGEN tendies !!!
   
tldr: u retards love money. AZN makes money. You invest = You make money. Not hard. December 20 they have approval for new drug. Buy options december 24,2020 and you will make money. cheers

TRADING At: 54.30

Positions: Lost almost all my portfolio due to palantir so I could only do  55c 24,2020  at 1.28

AZN is a multinational pharmaceutical and biopharma company with over 70k employees. Before I even start lets look at its revenue.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gz9qt80smt361.png?width=1272&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa13fc08771057a10d27bed1b57fae4826b04324

You can see that it has been consistently profitable while also maintaining growth. It had a net income of around 1.2 billion dollars in 2019. Now you might say this is a hold stock. Well thats true. You can do your own dd for its vaccine  but rn its kinda shit. It  has  weird results and allegedly stated it administered the wrong dose amount yet that resulted in a 90%.

The vaccine stopped an average of 70% of participants from falling ill, an [early analysis](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QK8M480C92BS) of the data show. The effectiveness rose to 90% for one of two regimens, using half a dose followed by a full one later, close to the high bar set by Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc.-Bloomberg

Now if they are able to do something and establish a better foothold the stock will probably skyrocket. So far the vaccine has been priced in however the vaccine has been priced in by how much it sucks so if they are able to do anything to increase it to around the 95%&lt; mark I think they will become a major footholder in the vaccine race. However, that is a big if so fuck that dont be retarded and take the risk. I want to focus on something that will make you retards quickckkkk money. On december 20 AZN and its partner Fibrogen Inc. have a pdfua set for the drug Roxadustat. It is an oral pill which is used for the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease with anemia. Now there are around more than 37 million American adults may have CKD,1 and it is estimated that more than 1 out of every 7 people with kidney disease have anemia. Most people who have kidney failurewhen kidney damage is so advanced that less than 15 percent of the kidney is working normallyalso have anemia.-[www.niddk.nih.gov](http://www.niddk.nih.gov/)

With this a 37 million reach just in America is no joke. If this is approved the smallest dose of Roxadustat (10mg) goes for 60USD. So their new market just in the US is a cap of 2,220,000,000 dollars.. Now I could go into the chemistry for this however I think those who actually read this will do their own dd into it. So lets get into if this will pass or not. Now I am telling you this it is 95% going to be approved. 

Why? 

Roxadustat is currently approved in China for the treatment of anemia in patients with CKD, regardless of whether they require dialysis, and in Japan for the treatment of dialysis patients with anemia of CKD. FibroGens partner Astellas also intends to file a marketing authorization application with the European Medicines Agency in the first half of 2020.

\-biospace

Also, if you want more proof the fda didnt even have to hold a advisory meeting for this and its establishment as a working treatment with little to no side effects has already been established. So if this passes. Fibrogen Inc with ticker Fgen will actually skyrocket and AZN will as well through direct partnership and the fact that they are going to commercialize together. So you can get into whichever ticker you wish tbh but I chose AZN. This comes out december 20,2020 so positions for December 24 will be good and I am a bit skeptical for AZN long term growth for their vaccine but for this quick pump and maybe not dump I would recommend buying a couple of options at least. 

Most recent news:

AZN is looking to get emergency approval for its covid vaccine and since India is corrupt it will probably go through ;however, they will not have the same reach as pfizer due to their weird ass results

Title: I legitimately think I found a hack that allows you to only lose a maximum of 5%, but get infinite gains
Ok this may be the autist in me talking right now, but please someone tell me if there's any reason this wouldn't work.

Lots of people out there think the market is "inflated". Since I don't do my own research and only listen to retards on reddit, I am somewhat concerned of a huge crash. Now let's say theres a stock out there worth $100, let's call it $ASS. If I buy $ASS for $100 and put a limit on it where it will sell if it reaches $95, then I will only lost 5%.

Now this is where the magic happens. What if you can put another additional filter that will buy the stock if it reaches $95 (after it rises again). That means you cant lose more than 5%. Then when the retards on wallstreet continue to print money, the stock will only go up and I wont end up behind. 

Lets go over my example:

1) Buy $ASS for $100  
2) Set limit to sell $ASS if it goes below $95, and set a limit to buy $ASS if it goes above $95.   
3) $ASS dips to $90, so I sell the stock at $95.   
4) $ASS releases a new state of the art VR product which boosts its price to $110, so during that rise i buy the stock at $95.   
5) My $100 investment turns into $110

&amp;#x200B;

You literally cant lose (more than 5%).

Title: Dave and (mostly) Busters. Lets short this cuck PLAY
As we all know, restaurants and bars are getting straight up molested by this whole COVID thing. Dave and Busters is a great example of a restaurant chain that got fucked last quarter; several of their locations are still closed or operating on a limited basis. 

[https://nypost.com/2020/09/18/dave-busters-warns-of-mass-layoffs-as-covid-19-shuts-arcades/](https://nypost.com/2020/09/18/dave-busters-warns-of-mass-layoffs-as-covid-19-shuts-arcades/)

This article points out that upper management never planned to permanently close any locations; I believe this was a major mistake as they could have used this pandemic to trim their less profitable locations and focus on improving their money makers. This means they have just been paying all the expenses on these properties while they don't make them ANY money. 

[https://www.dallasnews.com/business/local-companies/2020/10/21/dave-busters-looks-to-raise-550-million-from-junk-bond-sale-to-get-it-through-pandemic-times/](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/local-companies/2020/10/21/dave-busters-looks-to-raise-550-million-from-junk-bond-sale-to-get-it-through-pandemic-times/)

the company just sold a bunch of this shit called junk bonds to keep them above water. I don't know about you, but selling shit bonds because your business can't make money doesn't seem like a winning long term recovery strategy. 

[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dave-busters-stock-soars-28-after-covid-19-vaccine-trial-announcement-2020-11-09](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dave-busters-stock-soars-28-after-covid-19-vaccine-trial-announcement-2020-11-09)

The stock jumped 28% after news of the COVID vaccine came out; not out of any boost in the valuation of the company. When the earnings come out this week, we will truly see how badly Dave Busted. This is going to drive the stock down, and I think we should all collectively short this little bitch. I don't even know if it helps me to have other people short the stock too, but fuck it, I kinda like some of you guys and this could be a guaranteed (terms and conditions apply) money maker. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck Dave and Busters.

There's a few things that do. The easiest to see is the fact that they have a product. Their first van type vehicle(aka the BangBus) has already went through 50 crash tests and has actually been driving on the  highway. 

The most exciting fact is the **Skateboard Design.** First watch [THIS](https://youtu.be/8m3fRujSlW0). The skateboard is essentially everything that makes the car go. Combine this with their steer by wire design(frees up a ton of space and can be put anywhere) and you have everything you need to make the car drive in the floor of the vehicle. This means for every model they're just adding the top "shell" to the skateboard and BOOM: you have a vehicle. Once they finalize the skateboard design(which they pretty much have done) then they can pump out new EV models like nothing. I'm talking delivery van, pickup truck, sports car, sedan, etc. [This picture sums it up](https://i0.wp.com/alabamanewscenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Canoo_Design_Exterior_Possibilities.jpg?ssl=1) All they have to do is the design work, slap it on the skateboard, and run some tests. 

Their **Subscription Based Model** makes electric cars available to a a whole new market. This includes people who don't want to fully buy/own a car. The monthly fee covers literally everything so it's perfect for them. It includes people who can't afford to buy an electric car. The subscription model lowers the price of owning an EV, making it accessible to more customers. And then since it's easier for them to make new models, they may be the first to put an electric delivery van or pickup truck on the market. This would attract a TON of retail businesses/people.

Now the rest is **Purely Speculative** but there are plenty of potential deals that may arise that make a lot of sense. The most being an **Uber** or Lyft deal. The subscription model makes Canoo vehicles perfect for Uber drivers. No gas expense, no maintenance fee, won't have to dirty your own car, etc. And Uber could then play this up in advertising by saying many of their drivers "drive electric".

This is another popular one but a shot in the dark. **Apple** has been wanting to get into the EV game for awhile. Canoo would be the perfect target for an investment. An innovative product that rethinks how vehicles are traditionally made and sold. It's not like Apple has ever made anything like that before...........

**The Stock Itself:**

Canoo has largely been under the radar until the past week or so. They have a lot of good things happening this month, which could serve as major catalysts. They're unveiling their delivery van on December 17th, voting on the merger on the 21st, and who knows what else might happen. Canoo is being valuated at $2.4 billion through this merger, which is criminally low. The only way I see this company going is up from here on out.

TLDR; Shares, Warrants, Calls. They all go.

Title: $VLDR the next Pump
 Velodyne backers including Ford, Baidu Inc., Nikon Corp. and Hyundai Mobis will retain an 80% stake in the combined company (That means it will have a low float available to the public). The San Jose-based company will have about $200 million in cash on its balance sheet, and David Hall, Velodynes founder, will become executive chairman. Velodyne Chief Executive Officer Anand Gopalan will continue to lead the company.  Velodyne creates radar-like systems for self-driving vehicles that use lasers to generate three-dimensional images of a surrounding environment. Its technology is used by carmakers including Mercedes-Benz and Ford, according to its website.

Title: Do you want to bet against reddit? I have the answers
I have been collecting and analyzing data from popular subreddits. This week I am looking at the options contracts that have been mentioned on the subreddits I track.  Specifically, I am looking at contracts expiring this Friday 12/11.    The data collected for this analysis was collected from 11/29  12/5.  For Fridays expiration there are 186 contracts and 330 mentions of these contracts.  The most popular contract is the 12/11 TSLA 600 Call with 14 mentions.  


The goal here is to track what reddit is following and to see how reddit preforms.  There is this notion that retail investors often fail to beat the market. This is why financial advisors recommend that you buy into the major ETFs such as SPY.  As historically there have been few people that manage to beat the major Indexs year over year.  My hypothesis going into this week is that I should bet against the trends on reddit as typically the retail investor is wrong.  


Call Data


* Out of the 186 contracts 150 are calls (+80%+ Long)  

* 75.3% of the calls are out of the money

* The out of the money Calls are an average of 23% out of the money. 

* The in the money calls are an average of 19.3% in the money. 


Put Data


* Out of 186 Contracts 36 are puts

* 86.1% of the puts are out of the money

* The out of the money puts are an average of 20% out of the money

* The in the money puts are an average of 8% in the money 


On both the call and put sides the out of the money contracts are an average of 20%+ out of the money.  I am not that surprised as there is a lot of yolo culture on reddit.  It is surprising to see the number of contracts that are out of the money in general.  Out of the 186 contracts only 42 are in the money as of last Fridays close. 

The most popular calls that are in the money are the 

* TSLA 570  590 
* ACB 10.  

The most popular puts that are in the money are all NKLA.  

The most popular calls that are out of the money are the 

* TSLA 600 - 650, 
* GME 20, 
* PLTR 25 - 40, 
* AMD 100, 
* SPY 370 - 380,
* APHA 9.  

The most popular puts that are out of the money are 

* NKLA 15, 
* PLTR 15  21, 
* NIO 40 
* ACB 7.  

As I said above my hypothesis going into this week is that the majority of these contracts will end up being losers.  Based on this data I would probably look to sell the 370 Spy Calls and TSLA 600 calls if my hypothesis turns out to be right.  For now this is just for fun, but I will be running more in-depth analysis to see if I find anything interesting. 

Edit For reference as of 12/7 Market Open:

* SPY 370 Calls: $2.10
* TESLA 600 Calls: $2500

Title: Cameco
Hello fellow autists,

Senate just passed a bill for the creation of a uranium reserve but outlawed China and Russia from being suppliers. 

[CCO.TO](https://CCO.TO) has popped and will continue to climb as uranium prices rise for Canadian producers. Get in before we go parabolic.

Title: Big potential right here!
As most of you know, the world has a massive recycling problem. A even bigger problem with plastic waste. 

tl:dr: Purecycle is a recycling company showing massive growth, in a market with slim competition. They are creating virgin like recylced plastic from waste that would otherwise land in our oceans or in landfills. Going public via spac ticker: $roch. The merger is expected to bring in about $667 million to their balance sheet. Merger is planned for by Q1 2021.

**Purecycle:** is a partner of Procter &amp; Gamble, with patents for Technologies for recycling of plastic waste. They can create virgin like resin out of waste by separating colour, smell and other  contaminants from the waste to tur it into  Ultra-Pure Recycled Polypropylene, which can be reused.  The process creates recycled polypropylene (rPP), which, while being one of the highest volume, most versatile and robust plastics, has an extremely low reclamation rate across the globe. 

[Watch an introduction video here: https:\/\/purecycletech.com\/](https://preview.redd.it/6gzddbl5us361.png?width=1041&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8469477dd193d26b723975045dd37fdacaa099af)

 PureCycles ground-breaking, patented recycling process, developed and licensed by Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) and commercialized by PureCycle, separates color, odor and other contaminants from plastic waste feedstock to transform it into Ultra-Pure Recycled Polypropylene (UPRP) resin with virgin-like properties. Non-recycled plastic taxes have given interest and demand for, PureCycles UPRP. Today there is virtually no UPRP in the market.

 So far the difference between virgin material and recycled plastic could easily be detected with the naked eye. Yet the problem with recycled plastic is not its grey colour. Rather, many market players are criticising the lack of quality and the less than 100% purity which is an important requirement for food packaging with its strict regulations.  A range of test series have now been completed with empty plastic packaging, resulting in PureCycle. 

**This is how it works**: The new method allows the renewal of recycled polypropylene so that it becomes almost indistinguishable from unused plastic. The underlying technology, which has already been patented, apparently permits the removal of virtually all impurities and residual dyes from recycled plastics. At the same time, the performance and properties are almost the same as in new materials. 

https://preview.redd.it/won62231ss361.png?width=1072&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1eba4782a21d661afee9328b4624049cf50d14f

Sadly, currently most plastic waste lands either in our oceans or in landfills, wich is not a sustainable solution.  PureCycle holds the possibility to solve for the ongoing problem of recycling the approximately 170 billion pounds of PP produced every year, which has averaged a 5% rate of growth over the last five years.

Purecycle plans on going public via spac  Roth CH Aquisition I Co (ticker: $roch) . Current valuation: $1.2 Billion. They are expected to announce their next plant in Europe, which will be opperational by aproximated 2 years.

**Why is this big:** 

1) Plastic waste is a massive problem. Demand for plastic is growing, demand  is over 170 billion pounds per year with a rather fast grownig trend as poorer areas of the globe are quickly ramping up production. Only around 1% of polypropylene is currently being recycled.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/purecycletech.com\/](https://preview.redd.it/0hdo1e4nos361.png?width=802&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2410cf40f101497a4677bffb1fc1cad94fb52717)

2) Big partners: Procter &amp; Gamble, L'oreal, BMW, Total and Nesl. Several fortune 500 companies have signed long term contracts for offtake agreements.  PureCycle Technologies, is announcing it has partnered with global industrial manufacturer, Milliken &amp; Company and the worlds largest food and beverage company: Nestl. 

3) Groundbreaking technology for solving one of the biggest current problems in the world. This company is literally trying to solve our biggest problem! Time magazine calls purecycles patents one of the best inventions of 2019.  PureCycle has been recognized by the American Chemistry Council for its innovation in plastics recycling.

4) These are the kind of companies that are going to massively profit of a Biden presidency. If these guys get some incentives to expand platns this is going to the moon! They are already planning 5 plants by 2023. They are predicted to recycle over 1.2 billion pound of plastic by the next 5 years.

5) The special thing about their tech is that it is both more cost and energy efficiant than traditional production of plastic (utulizing 75% less energy), even though these "old economy" comanies are being subsidized by goverment incentives. This is not a boomer stock, this is the new economy.

6) They are currently being approved by the FDA, for food grade applications. Purecycle recently raised $300 million in tax-exempt municipal bond offering for funding of facilities.

7) As you might guess, the competition in this area is slim. This is a capital intensive niche branche where currently great demand is not met. The merger is expected to bring in  $667 million to their balance sheet. Merger is planned for by Q1 2021.

Anyway, just my 2 cents.

Title: Some excerpts from the book The Deals that Made the World that reference PLTR
  

Hi, fellow autists.

As PLTR is seeing some action again, here is one excerpt that stood out to me from the book *The Deals that Made the World*:

&amp;#x200B;

# Palantir is immensely secretive. It wields as much real-world power as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple, but unlike them, Palantir operates so far under the radar, it is special ops. 

 excerpted from *The Deals that Made the World* *by Jacques Peretti, with grammar corrections by the resident autist*

&amp;#x200B;

PS.

Yes, I have re-written that sentence.  I do not know why the author uses a company name as if it were a plural entity. It's a bit jarring the way he writes. The original excerpt was as follows:

*Palantir are immensely secretive. They wield as much real-world power as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple, but unlike them, Palantir operate so far under the radar, they are special ops.* 

&amp;#x200B;

It's not only Palantir, though: other companies are also treated in the same manner in the book.  I quote two example sentences below that contain Google and Amazon.

 *The New Scientist* *revealed what Google were up to next.*  

 *Amazon seek to reshape our world by transforming the nature of delivery and service, becoming every shop and every service using robots.*

&amp;#x200B;

*Did nobody proofread this book?*  

&amp;#x200B;

Some other tidbits from the same chapter in the book, Chapter 13, are presented below (again with my grammar correction filters applied):

# Palantir is to data what McKinsey is to consultancy. All-powerful, yet no one knows they even exist.

# ...

# Palantir is at the heart of the US government, but with its other arm, Palantir Metropolis, it provides the analytical tools for hedge funds, banks and financial services firms to outsmart each other.

# ...

# Together the Big Five (plus the invisible sixth ring, Palantir, the all-seeing eye) compose a new superclass of corporate might.

Title: BEAM Me Up Scottie to Tendies
Ok autists, heres my next one: BEAM Therapeutics.  Everyone and their wifes boyfriend want CRISPR technology to be successful.  These have been running riot in the last few months, but they still have a long way to go.  CRSP, EDIT, NTLA are already old news.  Sure, you can cure beta-Thalassemia, and Sickle Cell Disease, easy-peasy.  The problem is that the double stranded breaks that CRISPR uses are super bad for you.  Google that shit.  That has been one of the ways scientists studying aging have prematurely aged mice in the lab.

Enter BEAM Therapeutics.  BEAM uses the same CRISPR concept to locate a specific spot in your DNA, but doesnt require breaking the DNA strands at all.  They use a strategy called Base Editing, where the CRISPR protein finds the DNA that you want, and then they edit the single nucleotide by changing it into a different nucleotide.  Its genius.  On top of that, they have the next, next technology: Prime Editing.  This makes a little nick in the DNA and also doesnt require a double stranded break.

BEAM has a market cap of somewhere between $3 to $4 billion depending on the day.  They have enough funding secured for a 1-year runway.  There are recent successes with boomer CRISPR (looking at you CRSP) that will cause tons of money to flow into the gene editing field.  All of those companies have ultra-small market caps compared to the value they add to society.  Im long the whole field, but because of the double stranded break issue, I have to believe Base Editing and Prime Editing are the future.

Title: FDA is only the beginning, CDC will follow suit and use Palantir
Palantir's up today in part due to 3-year 44.4 million dollar FDA contract to power their data collection for drug research [source] (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/palantir-wins-fda-contract-to-power-drug-review-and-inspections).  
In the wake of COVID-19, the Biden administration will do a retrospective and attempt to fix what went wrong. The CDC's failure to adequately measure the spread of COVID-19 was one of the greatest failures by the US government. Each state publishes its own COVID data in its own format. So, you have at least 50 different websites, each with multiple webpages, all in different data formats that need to be scraped and compiled into a single platform to adequately measure and study the spread throughout the US. Instead, the "COVID Tracking Project," literally a team of volunteers started tracking this shit on Google spreadsheets and that became the defacto "database" for academic research. Thankfully, the founding autist of Facebook's data analytics team joined this volunteer effort and unfucked their retarded spreadsheets into a real database which has been referenced over 500 times in academic literature. The point being that a couple of people got bored working from home and spearheaded the data platform from which academics across the country used to conduct actual research [source for gay bears] (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-11-20/covid-tracking-project-volunteers-step-up-as-u-s-fails-during-pandemic)  
The government can't attract tech talent for shit. The starting salary for a fresh CS major is 75k. They're not going to work in some shit government office with shit coffee and shit dress code. They're going to fuck off to some millennial pets.com bullshit company with unlimited food and a huge paycheck to blow on PLTR calls. This is Palantir's bread and butter. Just get a braindead bureaucrat to point Palantir's brainfuck software at the raw data and it unfucks it into a structured dataset.  

TL;DR: Tableau made it easy for dumb fucks to visualize data. Palantir makes it easy for dipshits to collect data. A lot of dipshits work for the government. The government needs to collect more data. $$$

Title: All aboard the **ARKG**: Some actual DD - 1,000% returns in 3 days 
**What is ARKG**
ARKG is a managed ETF with exposure to CRISPR, gene editing, therapeutics, agricultural biology and health care innovation.

**Why Invest Now?**
This past weekend several companies in this space presented very promising results at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meeting, one of the years largest medical conferences.

1. https://www.wsj.com/articles/gene-editing-shows-promise-in-sickle-cell-disease-11607189442

2. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/traders-sift-through-virtual-blood-meeting-s-winners-and-losers

To say these guys are going to change the world is a gross understatement. Betting on any individual one involves a bit more risk than I prefer so this managed ETF is excellent and their management team is wayyy smarter than any of us!

**How do we profit?**
These companies are prime acquisition targets for the Pharma companies that just put out covid vaxs, have astronomical valuations and investors nagging them about what comes next to justify their massive valuations. 

**How Profitable?**
Last week I purchased $8k worth of 90 call options expiring 12/18/20 this morning they are worth $80k. Yeah that's right **1000% return!***

So stop wasting your hard earned tendies on stupid gamestop to watch it go the way of Blockbuster and instead **INVEST** in the next generation of **Pharmaceutical Blockbuster Therapies**. Invest in the technology that is actually going to change the world and directly make your life better!!!

Title: Uranium: the most underrated bull market thats only just begun
The house just passed a bill to create a strategic reserve of uranium which excludes China/Russia participation and has the US spending $1.5B per year for the next 10 years.

The bill has bipartisan support, which is very rare these days, and is sure to pass in the senate.

With a Biden White House, oil and natural gas are already expected to take a hit in favor of clean energy. Nuclear is by far the favorite clean energy alternative among the GOP and energy investors (you cant buy and sell wind or sunlight) and will see huge improvement in the next few years being the only alternative that will have legislation approved by both parties.

Title: Kitchen Trade - Lifetime Brands
 

Kitchen trade is on fire... the pandemic caused many people to have to stock up on kitchen essentials since they need to cook more meals at home. The holiday season is adding more tailwinds to the industry, because it is a top item on Christmas wish lists. Check out these trend charts on kitchen utensils. Trade is Lifetime Brands. They are the #1 kitchen accessory company in the whole damn world. Ride or Die.

The are the sole licensed brand for Instant Pot Accessories, and sell knives for the highest sold knife brand, Farberware.

Management is working towards a goal of $90M+ EBITA which makes this one a steal at is current market cap.

This trade will not fizzle out... once people start learning how to cook. they will cook more. People will continue to stock up on all the Kitchen essentials as they learn how to cook and even some may consider it a hobby.

Title: EV Battery technology game changer play.
Listen up tendy and cocaine lovers. Let me help you out with the next gamechanging play. 

**HPQ-Silicon resources, $V.HPQ ($URAGF for US autists) canadian penny stock trading at $CAD 0,73 at the time of writing.**

First things first: This does not trade on Robin Hood. TDA has it, I don't know what other US brokers have it. 

Position second: 15.000 shares long, planning to buy up to 50.000 shares.

#$V.HPQ ($URAGF) is going to break the EV Battery Market. 

Tesla (and others) stated that (nano) Silicon is the way to go on the battery front. Does give some problems:

* Expensive to make nano silicon and commercialize the proces (Retail price of 30.000$ a kg to make it work).

* Gets gooey and turns to shit after expanding and shrinking.

* Real fucking expensive (Graphite is way cheaper).

#$V.HPQ ($URAGF) is going to replace the graphite in Lithium ion batteries with carbon coated nano Silicon particles.

Title: Trine Acquisiton (TRNE) and the fourth industrial revolution
Trine Acquisiton is an SPAC that in the next few weeks will be doing a reverse merger with a company called Desktop Metal. They make a 3D printer that makes small metal parts that were once thought to be difficult and expensive to make. Now through a complicated process I don't understand well enough to explain, it can be printed saving time and money. The process is explained in way more detail on their [website.](https://www.desktopmetal.com/)

They have a variety of different products, including a range in systems from smaller scale production designed for engineers building prototypes, to a larger scale printer for mass production. The metals they print include Copper, two different grades of stainless steel and three other metals I don't know anything about. Again more details on their [website.](https://www.desktopmetal.com/materials)

Customers listed on their website include 3M, Medtronic, Toyota, BMW, and even the US military. Basically any company that produces anything with small metal parts could in theory become a customer making the growth potential astronomical. The industry as a whole is expected to grow from a total of $12 Billion today, to $150 Billion by the end of 2030.

The key difference between this company and it's competitors is something called "single jet passing." Through this process, the system can produce everything faster than any other system currently available.

There are however draw backs to the company. They are relatively new, and therefor need to expand to reach their full potential. The industry as a whole also takes time to change, and growth for the company will progress as slowly as their market changes. As a result DM's aggressive targets for growth seem difficult to attain. Essentially, patience will be key as most of their current and immediate value will be dependent on the hype they generate.

The stock is up 75% in the past few weeks, so it's really no secret. The buy low opportunity has come and gone. But the long term payday here is immense. It's being regarded as a potential 10 bagger based off of industry trends.

**TL/DR** This company was founded by MIT nerds and is positioned to dominate an emerging market. I don't believe the company's own aggressive growth forecasts but there is a shitload of room for growth. I'm holding for the long run and so should you.

Title: This stock is a gold mine

Let me first tell you, that I own 50% of walmarts capital. Which I have gained from repeatedly selling triple digit penny stocks as a boy. When I go to walmart, its amazing to know that I darn near own this place! Like wow! You cant go wrong with this, ill tell ya that. Walmart will shoot to around 5000% by next week, because I have gone behind the scenes and expected my work. Look at it like this, how many of those fat asses you know will fill up the lines, fill up the walmart parking lot, and empty isles once more this pandemic is over. Exactly, if you dont have walmart as part your portfolio you are missing out, it will be your mutual fund. There will never be another walmart.

Title: Xmas is coming, $SNOW will be FALLING: How did $SNOW manage to become a historic $113B bubble.
**Summary**: I know you dont want to read. So in short, $SNOW has risen rampantly recently and become a bubble. People only see the headline revenue growth without noticing its declining growth rate, declining NVRR, significantly worse-than-estimate EPS, below-average guidance, and intensifying industry competition. Among all the companies with 50+B market cap in the US stock market history, none of them has come even remotely close to $SNOWs insane valuation.

&amp;#x200B;

**Position**: 12/18 350P, 1/15 300P, 5/19 250P. 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2020 is coming to an end. This year we have witnessed the almighty power of retail investors -- buying blindly after reading just headlines; following 18yo investing gurus on Twitter, TikTok, or StockTwits;  and riding pump-and-dump schemes trying to take advantage of greater fools. Against this backdrop, we managed to create a bubble as big as $SNOW. Now trading at $113B, $SNOWs current valuation dwarfs other tech firms at the height of the dotcom bubble in 2000.

&amp;#x200B;

# Why Are People Buying $SNOW?

$SNOW reported earnings for the first time last week. Its result was slightly upbeat, although I would rather call it **mixed**. However, retail investors do not care about the actual state of the company. **The only thing that matters is how the news headlines are reporting it.** Since headlines read $SNOW Q3 revenue growth over 100% yoy, people have now started buying fearlessly, without realizing how much of a bubble $SNOW has already become. 

&amp;#x200B;

# What the Headlines Do Not Tell: the Ugly Facts behind $SNOWs Valuation

**1. $SNOWs revenue beats estimate, but not by much, and its far from a surprise**

Q3 revenue is 159.6M, which beats estimate 147.1M by only **8.5%.** Yet, stock price has risen **40**\+**%**, from 290$ to 400+$. Something does not add up here. $ZM rose about that much after its Q2 earnings. but $ZMs revenue beat estimate **more than 30%?** Moreover, $ZM gave up most of that gain just a couple of days later. And now after 3 months, it is still trading lower than back then. **Don't you see that $SNOWs jump is a lot more overdone?**

&amp;#x200B;

**2. $SNOWs revenue growth rate and net revenue retention rate is already DECLINING.**

Source: [S-1 Form](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001640147/1c70b06a-4d3b-4a37-9c42-76ec47742398.pdf) [10-Q Form](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001640147/afd24d78-1425-49ca-9cd9-6ae57c5712c0.pdf)

Its true that $SNOWs revenue grew more than 100+% yoy this quarter. But if you expect its revenue to keep doubling forever, **you would be completely delusional**.

$SNOWs revenue of fiscal year ending Jan 2019 and Jan 2020, was $96.7M and $264.7 million  **174% yoy growth.** 

$SNOWs revenue of six months ending Jul 2019 and Jul 2020, was $104.0M and $242.0M  **133% yoy growth.**

And now $SNOW reports Q3 yoy revenue growth **115%**. Do you recognize a trend here? 

**174% &gt; 133% &gt; 115%**

**Its growth rate is DECLINING**, people! **It cannot keep growing 100+% over the next few years**. $SNOW grows fast right now because its current revenue is **too small**, **smaller than 1/200 of its market cap**. As the company matures, it's almost certain that growth will slow down.

**Same story with the net revenue retention rate** (NVRR), which the SaaS industry uses as a valuation matric. Retail investors read the headline and see a 162% NVRR, thinking this must be a buy. But back in Jan 2020, NVRR was 180%. As of Jul 2020, it was 169%. And now, it is 162%. **180% &gt; 169% &gt; 162% right?**

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Positive revenue growth does NOT mean $SNOW is making more money. In fact, $SNOWs EPS is 3 times WORSE than estimate. $SNOW is not expected to make money even in 2023.**

Q3 **EPS is -1.01$** vs estimate **-0.26$. $SNOW is LOSING 3 times more money than expected** to realize that revenue growth, which beat estimate by only 8.5%. 

**3 TIMES** EPS miss  just **8.5%** revenue growth beat? Does that really sound positive to you?

As I quote the companys SEC filing again, *We have incurred substantial losses during our history,* ***do not expect to become profitable in the near future, and may never achieve profitability***. I really wonder all this extreme hype surrounding $SNOW is based on what? Are retail investors really seeing something that even the company itself does not see into the future? Or **is everybody just dreaming**?

Goldman Sachs estimates $SNOW will still be bleeding money even in 2023.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Q4 revenue guidance is BELOW AVERAGE estimate**

For Q4, $SNOW projects $162-$167M in revenue, which is below the average estimate $166M. This is largely the reason why **$SNOWs price was falling at first after earnings.** As the more rational $SNOW investors are selling their shares, bagholders on Twitter, TikTok or whatever, start to pump the stock using **cherry-picked positive numbers**.

Some analyst says the guidance could be conservative. Conservative based on what? Based on the fact that you are long so you want to pump the stock? With the declining growth rate as we have seen, the guidance makes perfect sense. 

Another cloud company, $SPLK also reported Q3 revenue this week. It missed estimate by 9% and its stock dropped 23%? Was its estimate also conservative, Mr. analyst?

&amp;#x200B;

**5. $SNOWs market cap is even higher than its Total Addressable Market (TAM) of 2023.**

According to IDC, the markets for Analytics Data Management and Integration Platforms and Business Intelligence and Analytics Tools, which $SNOW addresses, will have a combined value of $56 billion by the end of 2020 and **$84 billion by the end of 2023**. Lets not talk about how **$SNOWs market cap is even larger than the its entire market in 2023**. But how much of market share can $SNOW realistically achieve?

Its FY2021 revenue estimate 578M is **only about 1% of the total market**. For SNOWs market cap to make sense, people are expecting it to own at least half of market share of the entire market in the long run. Is that possible? Cloud is an industry with ever tougher competition. You **expect $SNOW to grow its industry presence by 50 times, while other competitors: Amazon, Google, Microsoft do nothing, sit idly and watch**? There will be more discussion on this later.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. $SNOWs CEOs compensation is worth MORE than the companys revenue!**

[Source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-04/snowflake-ceo-collects-a-95-million-payout-every-month#:~:text=Snowflake%20CEO%20Collects%20a%20%24108%20Million%20Payout%20%E2%80%94%20Every%20Month,-By&amp;text=A%20compensation%20package%20he%20received,or%20about%20%241.3%20billion%20annually)

CEO Frank Slootman now collects **$108M** worth of compensation **every month**. Thats **324M per quarter**, but the **companys quarterly revenue is only 160M**? I know the compensation is not all cash, but linked to RSUs and options. Yet still, doesnt it ring an alarm bell? At what other company can **a CEO be paid twice the entire companys revenue**? And its REVENUE, not profit! The company has no profit yet. Doesnt this illustrate how insane the companys valuation has become?

# 

# How Does $SNOW Compare to $ZM, $TSLA, and the Dot-com Bubble

**1. vs Analysts price targets**

I personally do not trust analysts targets. This year, analysts are handing out positive ratings like candies. We have seen **crazy sh\*t targets like a 79$ for $NKLA**. Lol. And moreover, **$SNOWs IPO have pretty much everybody on the street as its underwriter**. This make the banks **more biased** to give a buy rating.

Even so, $SNOWs current price is still **much higher than even the most bullish analyst**. Analysts want retail people to buy blindly. They just did not expect people could go **THIS blind**. 

JP Morgan target: 250$ (36% down potential)

Morgan Stanley: 265$ (32% down potential)

Credit Suisse: 265$ (32% down potential)

Goldman Sachs: 308$ (20% down potential)

&amp;#x200B;

**2. $ZM**

If you are that impressed with SNOWs 100% revenue growth, you probably forgot about **$ZMs 367% yoy growth this quarter?** Not only did that beat estimate by 12%, its EPS also beat by over 30%. Even so, **$ZM's price fell after earnings because it didn't live up to people's expectation**. So  what are people expecting for $SNOW's next quarter? $SNOWs market cap is now almost as big as $ZMs, although with **only 1/5 revenue, 1/3 growth rate, and a negative EPS.**

If you think $ZM is trading cheap because vaccine is coming and WFH is ending, but $SNOW is trading expensive because WFH does not have an impact on $SNOWs business. **Think twice**. **WFH has accelerated cloud adoption**. As people cannot go to office to maintain on-premise data storage solutions, companies were forced to embrace the benefit of cloud. **Same with video conferencing, after WFH ends, growth in cloud business will decelerate**.

When the vaccine news came out on Dec 9 and Dec 10, **both $ZM and $SNOW fell significantly**. This proves **$SNOW also belong to the WFH stock category**. With vaccine FDA approval on near horizon, $SNOW is destined to fall again.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. $TSLA**

I dont have a view on $TSLA, I just want to compare. There are some people who think $TSLA is overvalued. I guess they never heard about $SNOW. **$TSLAs valuation is nothing when compared to $SNOW.**

* $TSLAs P/S ratio is smaller than 20. While $SNOWs is close to 200. **10x as big.**
* $TSLAs P/E ratio is positive, with forward 12M P/E at 162. Whereas $SNOW will be bleeding money even in 2023.
* $TSLA has a chance to become the leader in EV industry, like an iPhone among all mobile phones. Can $SNOW become the leader in the cloud space? Highly unlikely. 
* EV market annual growth rate is expected to be 21% [Source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/05/15/2034346/0/en/Electric-Vehicle-EV-Market-to-Rise-at-21-1-CAGR-till-2026-Product-Innovations-are-Leading-to-Wider-Adoption-says-Fortune-Business-Insights.html), while IDC forecasts SNOWs industry to grow only 15% annually.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. The dot-com bubble**

Through the stock market history, **no company at $SNOWs size has been trading at such high valuation multiples**. Among all the companies with a 100+B market cap You know what, lets make our comparison even broader, lets look at **all the companies larger than $50B**. Amid the 2000 tech bubble, $CSCO was trading at the highest P/S ratio. **On Mar 22, 2000, $CSCOs P/S reached all time high of 57**. Its been 20 years now. After the bubble popped, CSCOs **price today is** **still more than 40% lower than 20 years ago**. 

Now you would argue, $CSCO and $MSFT etc. are big mature companies, how can you compare a growth company like $SNOW with them? Well, **20 years ago, $CSCO and $MSFT were growth companies too**. A lot of the growth companies back then, do not even EXIST anymore. Do you really want to compare $SNOW with those bankrupted companies?

Microsofts highest P/S ever: only **29,** reached during dot-com bubble. 

Googles highest P/S: **22 in 2005**. 

Facebooks highest P/S: **22.2 in 2014**. 

Apples highest P/S: only **8, reached in August this year**. (Yes Apples P/S was even lower when first iPhone was launched) 

**NO BIG TECH HAS REACHED A BUBBLE OF THIS SCALE EVER. Like, ever.**

&amp;#x200B;

# The Myths People Are Spreading about $SNOW

**MYTH 1: Warren Buffet invested in $SNOW, which means you should buy too.**

**BUSTED**! Warren Buffet is a value investor known for his reluctance to invest in technology. Of course **he did NOT participate in $SNOW IPO**. Oh dear god, please wake up, people! Buffett's deputies, namely Ted Weschler and Todd Comms, invested in $SNOW, **not Warren Buffet himself**! 

[Source](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/mergers-and-acquisitions/buffetts-deputies-bring-in-bets-from-snowflake-to-scripps-1#:~:text=Warren%20Buffett%20may%20have%20his,thank%20for%20a%20busy%20September.&amp;text=financing%20deal%20announced%20Thursday%20and,Ted%20Weschler%20and%20Todd%20Combs%20)

And now people are **using this as a propaganda to pump $SNOW**. Warren Buffett bought, you should buy too!

Yet I still do not understand the logic here. **Berkshire bought $SNOW when it was 120$ per share**, probably expected to make like 30%, 50% from their investments. And now, **you crazy retail people are buying $SNOW at 400$ per share, more than 3x IPO price**? What? So your investment logic is: **Anything Buffett buys, you would buy it at 3x price?** Oh in that case, if I am Warren Buffett, I would just buy everything in sight, then there will be some retards willing to pay me 3x price I paid. Lol, I just discovered an infinite money making machine.

**If you believe in Berkshire, you should YOLO your money in $BRK/B, not $SNOW!** Or alternatively, you can read Berkshire's 13F filing which lists most of its investment. You should **start buying every single stock in that list until it goes to 3x current price**. Why don't you do that?

&amp;#x200B;

**MYTH 2: $SNOW has technology that nobody else has and will achieve monopoly in the cloud space.**

I fully expect there will be $SNOW cultists arguing in the comment section nobody competes with $SNOW because they are the best. You dont understand its business. blahblah. So, I hereby quote the companys own words.

$SNOW competes with *1. large, well-established, public cloud providers that generally compete in all of our markets, including* ***AWS, Azure, and GCP****; 2. less-established public and private cloud companies...; 3. other established vendors of legacy database solutions or big data offerings; and 4. new or emerging entrants seeking to develop competing technologies*. The company recognizes *The markets in which we operate are highly competitive.* ***Many of our competitors have substantially greater brand recognition, customer relationships, and financial, technical, and other resources than we do*****.**

The biggest difference between Snowflake and others that I see, is that $SNOW bills customer per usage, while others often adopt fixed contracts. Other than this, there may be a couple more of data types supported, or a bit more optimization here and there. I **dont see anything game changing** with Snowflake that other competitors are unable to offer. Plus, the competition is getting real intense. Just days ago **Microsoft announced the launch of Azure Synapse to compete with Snowflake and alike**. [Source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/microsoft-takes-on-amazon-snowflake-in-cloud-data-services)

And moreover,

*****We currently only offer our platform on the public clouds provided by AWS, Azure, and GCP, which are also some of our primary competitors****. There is risk that one or more of these public cloud providers could use their respective control of their public clouds to embed innovations or privileged interoperating capabilities in competing products, bundle competing products,* ***provide us unfavorable pricing****, leverage its public cloud customer relationships to exclude us from opportunities, and treat us and our customers differently*

**This is the RISKIEST part of $SNOWs business**. **$SNOW is running its cloud on the infrastructure provided by its COMPETITORS**. Huh? Isn't it the same as **exposing your biggest weakness to your rivals**? Even if $SNOW manage to grab a much larger market share and become No.1 in the cloud space, if Amazon or Microsoft find $SNOW a threat and want to hamper its growth, **they can simply stop offering their infrastructure or raise the price**? If that happens, how is $SNOW going to survive then? **$SNOW's lifeline is literally in the hands of its biggest competitors!**

If you are buying $SNOW at current valuation amid the ever-intensifying competition in cloud space, fantasizing how $SNOW will beat everybody else, then **I think you are kidding yourself**.

&amp;#x200B;

# Some Final Words

I am not trying to convince you to go short, you are more than welcome to pump the price higher, then I can add some more puts. I just hope people can reflect on their rationale of buying $SNOW at 400$ per share. Do you really have a logical point, or are you just blindly following some random headlines? Its your own money. Make your own decision. But if you do want to go short, **it's better to buy puts than short selling stocks on this.**

FYI, yes some others have mentioned on this sub that **$SNOWs lockup will start to expire in a weeks time**. That is correct.

Finally, this will be my last DD on wsb. Thank you all for reading my past posts and I hope you liked them. I even got some followers lol which I didn't notice until recently. Again thank you very much.

KBNT - Kubient, I see a single post on here about this a few months back and they were right, they needed to prove the product and get some revenue.

[They are about to participate in multiple conferences this month - expect some big findings.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kubient-sets-december-2020-financial-223000859.html) If you go on this article that just got published a couple days ago, they aren't afraid to drop names, that gets press.

&gt; The SynthNet fraud was detected through Kubient's Artificial Intelligence (KAI), an in-stream ad-fraud prevention tool that uses pattern recognition and device scoring to catch and identify fraud before it happens. ***The result was a significant amount of fraudulent website and computer traffic being transmitted that claimed to come from mobile sources like The Washington Post, Weather Underground, and a mixture of apps in other categories such as gaming, entertainment, utilities, shopping, and food.***

&gt; Josh Weiss

&gt; Thanks, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our call.

&gt; Now to our financial results for the third quarter and 9 months ended September 30, 2020. Net revenue for the third quarter increased to $280,000 from $92,000 in the prior quarter and from $56,000 in Q3 of last year. The sequential and year-over-year increase in net revenue was due to a significant amount of revenue generated from two customers in the quarter.

&gt; *Net revenue for the 9 months ended September 30, 2020, increased to $1.8 million from $162,000 in the same period last year.*

&gt; *The increase was primarily due to revenue generated in connection with the beta testing of KAI as well as the significant amount of revenue generated from two customers.*


You read that right, they were making cash off of *the AI's beta test* - it is now in the wild and finding botnets.

Did I mention the company's market cap is under $50 million as of writing this? They just unleashed an AI that is about to slap everyone cheating on adsense, *this is about to make waves.*

With a market cap of $22B this company has a long way to climb to catch TSM's $535b - you think it wont get there? Here, I googled for you.

&gt; United Microelectronics (NYSE:UMC) shares are currently up 20% to $6.94 after a weekend report that the company is expanding its 28nm and 22nm capacity due to strong demand, according to Economic News Daily sources via Bloomberg.

&gt; The expansions will happen at the Tainan-based 12-inch wafer fab. UMC also reportedly plans to complete its 28nm at the Xiamen facility by the middle of next year.

&gt; Related: Last month, UMC reported Q3 revenue growth of 19% Y/Y. The company said 28nm sales grew sequentially as customer tape outs continued. UMC expected a "sustained increase" in the number of 28nm tape outs in Q4.

Title: LMPX - high-growth disruptor in the automotive industry.
LMPX - an opportunity to 3-4x your investment within a year.

Briefly about the company: LMP Automotive is an online auto dealership which is positioning itself to be a disruptor through its subscription model and online platform.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's look at what happened to the firm recently:

\- COVID-19 boosted LMPX's online sales and turbocharged the industry's transition to the online channel, subscription models and ride-sharing.

\- LMPX grew topline revenue by 240% in the 9 months of FY2020. I am projecting revenues to triple for the full year 2020 and at least double in FY2021. I will briefly talk about the valuation later.

\- Management announced a major acquisition and substantial investment in new auto inventory as well as new facilities to expand its business. After analyzing management commentaries, it is evident that there is a supply constraint which prevented revenues from increasing much more than 240%. Expansion plans will allow LMPX to grow revenues rapidly going into 2021 and 2022.

\- LMPX announced partnerships which shows that suppliers are eager to partner with LMPX and see the firm's growth potential and a promising business model.

&amp;#x200B;

Upcoming catalysts in the next 6-9 months:

My own research as well as commentary from the CEO indicate LMPX stock can get a substantial boost from the following upcoming catalysts:

\- Successful closing of financing agreements with banks and closing of the ongoing acquisition.

\- Significant expansion of its online platform with approx. 10,000 autos being planned to be placed on the platform.

Quoting the CEO: "we are one of the top 3 online-centric automotive companies in the country, but better than that, we're all about performance, we're all about execution. We believe that will drive sales to levels that it will be harder to fulfill than actually having the leads and lead conversions given the test markets and given the competition. That I believe will be the largest catalyst, when we put it all online."

Also, insiders own around 40% of the outstanding shares and are aligned with investors. Recently, insiders have been accumulating more shares in the 10-20 dollar price range and the CEO mentioned in an interview that he believes the stock significantly undervalues the company's near-term fundamentals which is the reason for such high insider ownership. What this all means is that 2021 can be a blockbuster year for LMPX and its stock.

&amp;#x200B;

Market opportunity / TAM:

\- Subscription based vehicle sales are estimated to account for 10% of all vehicle sales by 2025, which translates into a $100 billion opportunity by 2025. LMPX is one of the first movers and is expected to capture a large portion of this growing market.

\- The fact that LMPX revenues are up so much when the rest of the auto industry is down due to the pandemic indicates that LMPX is a disruptor and could see revenues multiply very soon.

&amp;#x200B;

Valuation and price target:

\- LMPX delivered revenues of approx. $26million in the 9 months of FY2020. I estimate full year 2020 revenues to come in at about $33 million which equates to a 200% increase over FY2019.

\- With the stock trading at $27 and with 10 million shares outstanding, LMPX has a market cap of $270 million. On a price to FY2020 sales basis, the stock has a P/S multiple of 8x. This is a very low multiple considering multiples the market is giving to other growth companies and considering that LMPX tripled revenues in 2020 and is expected to grow them considerably going into 2021-2022.

\- I expect revenues to at least double in 2021 and the stock to peak at a 15x P/Sales multiple. This implies a price target of $100 by year end 2021. Having said that, I aim to take profits in 90-100$ price range.

&amp;#x200B;

Positions/disclosure:

I am long 150 shares bought in at an average price of $27.5 and I am looking to add to the position once the price starts to indicate more upward momentum.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR - Long LMPX, current price $27, YE 2021 price target at $100.

Options - sorry I do not trade options, but if you want calls then go and figure yourself.

Title: Boomer Stock Recovery Play: Coca-Cola
**TLDR; Coca Cola is still 10% below it's pre-covid high.  It should go even higher.**  

For the 8 of you still reading, I present to you a somewhat neglected stock hurt by Covid that hasn't fully recovered, but also one whose February high of $60 is not a ceiling.  

Yes, Coca Cola has had a decent run from it's $36 March lows and is even up 12% since October, trading about $54/share as of Friday before pulling back a bit this morning.  It's not done yet.  Let me provide a few reasons why.

To understand where we're going, let's look at where we've been. Here's a 5 year chart.  

&amp;#x200B;

[5 year performance of KO: courtesy of CNBC](https://preview.redd.it/4lmb773xnl361.png?width=1538&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e426700a92d40cd64e6d58994cb5f330a9b8658)

The stock has been of a bit of a snoozer until it began to awake from its slumber about 2018, which accelerated through 2019 and then Wall Street really started to like it in 2020.  It had upward momentum, upset by Covid.  This momentum will return, very soon.

**Catalyst:  In Person Dining**

Why will momentum return?  Most importantly, vaccines will return restaurants back to normal operations by summer 2021. The restaurant industry has been in total carnage.  Independent restaurants are closing permanently every day, with large chains taking market share.  BUT - those that are still operating are living off of Off-Premise consumption.  IF people get drinks to go, they get one.  No refills.  This has depressed an entire major sector of Coke's sales.  As restaurants return to normal, they'll have more customers, and existing customers will be consuming more cokes per sale than they are now.  That's a double re-open win.

**Catalyst: Cutting overhead like a mo-fo**

There's more to this story.  Coke has used Covid as an opportunity to cut costs and streamline operations.  They've cut employees and overhead expense - [more than 1/3 of their North American employees](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/08/28/coca-cola-says-layoffs-buyouts-likely-part-restructuring/5654218002/).  They've cut a lot of niche product that had overhead burden and marketing/distribution expense but had little revenue, much less profit, [like Tab.](https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2020/10/19/Coca-Cola-discontinues-TaB-diet-soda-in-the-US)  

They're going to come out of this a leaner, more focused company.  They may still have an old and sleepy brand image, but they're also a cash printing machine, and they're going to be printing even more tendies to share with us.

**Catalyst: Falling Dollar**

But wait! There's more!

Coca Cola generates [roughly one third of its revenue from North America](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271136/coca-colas-revenue-distribution-worldwide-by-operating-segment/).  That leaves the balance subject to currency fluctuations.  With the dollar tanking, [those foreign profits are going to be worth even more.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/how-us-benefits-when-dollar-falls.asp) 

**Not Priced In**

Looking at the [CNBC.com](https://CNBC.com) earnings helps demonstrate that the street has not priced in the recovery, much less the benefits from restructuring and currency.  The company itself has not been providing guidance as they have no more visibility than we do how the almost random shutdown/reopen orders will happen.  They did, however, [warn that Q3 would be hampered by currency exchange rates when the dollar was strengthening](https://www.barrons.com/articles/coca-cola-stock-is-rising-after-earnings-heres-why-51595335348), the opposite of what is happening now and projected to continue for a bit.  How did Q3 end up when the currency was facing headwinds?  They beat the street consensus by 18.8%, and were just one cent per share less than a year ago - when unemployment was at a record low and everything was "normal".  

&amp;#x200B;

[Coke's Earnings Trend - CNBC](https://preview.redd.it/34xwla91jm361.png?width=1326&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15d64af9e6559ac5d1bb1e8bf1cc76f77e8f219b)

Based on the same CNBC data, the street is projecting that one year from now, after restaurants are fully operational, after the company has completed a worldwide restructuring that will eliminate 1/3 of its North American employees, and after the benefit of a presumed lower dollar, the company will just be earning 3 cents more in Q3 and Q4 2021 than it did in 2019, pre-covid.  Again, this would say that reopening their fountain sales division to normal levels is only worth 4 cents per share from this past quarter when much of the country remains shut down.  That seems low.  Too low.

**Benchmark: Starbucks**

What's the upside here?  I'm using Starbucks as the benchmark.  They're both beverage companies, though Starbucks is clearly more of a direct restaurant play, and more of a pure play on China's reopening - which is far ahead of the US's and the rest of the world's economy.  

&amp;#x200B;

[Starbucks One Year Performance - CNBC](https://preview.redd.it/ifebi0x2tl361.png?width=1562&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=606fe19138dfcfc86ff139b105225bc1b2dab23b)

Starbucks hit a high of about 93 in January, as Covid was already gripping China.  It then fell and rebounded to about $90 in February before beginning the March market swoon.  On the way back up it kept bouncing into that $90 level (frustrating the hell out of me holding $90 calls) before finally breaking through on the way to all time highs, now at $102, almost 10% above the January highs.

Looking at a similar pattern (though KO held on longer before a much quicker descent) I would expect KO to test $60 soon, and probably bounce off a time or two before breaking through.  Again, based on prior momentum I would expect once it clears $60 it should easily run up another 10%.  The market will quickly recognize when they reopen they're going to have more operating leverage than when the shutdown began, and they're going to start seeing currency gains as soon as this quarter.

**Benchmark: Pepsi**

Pepsi is probably viewed as Coke's more direct competitor.  Coke had been outperforming them over the last 3 years until the Covid dip.  Pepsi, more diversified because of its snack businesses, was the better stay at home play.  Coke has a decent catch up trade remaining.

[3 year performance Coke vs Pepsi: Barchart.com](https://preview.redd.it/x6eb2dahfm361.png?width=2326&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d74d592426a18cfc7be54f10f760bc19dd8fd53)

**Strategy:**

Sugar water doesn't get stock analysts excited any more than WSB casino patrons.  For that reason, I would not be looking at any FD's.  This one needs some longer dated options.

I want to get past the next earnings on 1/28 for evidence of the currency lift to begin to show, but the country will likely still be in winter Covid shutdown mode so I'm not sure we'll get guidance then based on restaurant openings.  I'm also feeling like mid-January/February could be a bit rough after a lights-out November and a presumed Santa Claus rally at month's end.  Keep some powder dry to buy this on dips. I am.

I'm thinking there's a three-prong approach here.  

For the first taste, February 55 calls.  Relatively low risk (only slightly OTM), gets us a few weeks past the next earnings date when we should at least see a currency boost, but also captures any run up as the market starts to figure out there's still reopening meat left here to take off the bone.

I'm going to put the heart of the play into June 60 calls.  The country should be mostly vaccinated, restaurants should be back to near normal.  Hopefully this will be telegraphed by the April earnings call.  If this gets priced in sooner...[Vega is your friend.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k7eto7/you_trolls_are_in_desperate_need_of_understanding/)

For a stretch, going to throw the balance of the play into leaps for Jan 2022 65's.  

I'm starting this position with $5K.  Because I expect a decent dip sometime Jan/Feb, will hopefully have some dry powder on the sideline to increase these positions if I've been too early on this move.  But as we've seen with many of the reopening plays, when the market decides it's time, I don't want to be late....or any later than I already am.

Title: Goldman Sachs (GS) plans to shift asset management division from NYC to either South Florida or Texas
GS stock closed Friday at $239.58 (+1.75%). 

Company executives have looked at possible South Florida office space near Miami, covering areas like Palm Beach County and Fort Lauderdale, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg News. 

"As announced at our investor day in January, we are executing on the strategy of locating more jobs in high value locations throughout the US, but we have no specific plans to announce at this time," a Goldman Sachs spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider. Company executives have looked at possible South Florida office space near Miami, covering areas like Palm Beach County and Fort Lauderdale, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg News. 

The plans to shift asset management to South Florida may ultimately not materialize, and the firm may go for a different city where it has been growing, like Dallas, according to people Bloomberg spoke with.

In October, Bloomberg and the Financial Times reported that hedge fund giant Elliott Management plans to move its headquarters from midtown Manhattan to West Palm Beach, Florida.

Title: Ever make a hole in one playing golf? Well now is your chance.
Hello fellow Autists. I am presenting easy money. You ever hear of Calloway Golf (ELY)?  

Its a golf sporting equipment company that designs, manufactures, markets and sells golf equipment products, more specifically clubs and balls, also including accessories such as bags, gloves, and caps. But the company has now taken a huge step and expanding the ability to create revenue and bring more recognition to their brand, and finding a new way to target new golfers. THEY ACCQUIRED TOPGOLF.

&amp;#x200B;

[They sell equipment for golf](https://preview.redd.it/a2bzny0juo361.png?width=275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17e342d886306a04a286e90fe170538a0fb6cf1e)

Topgolf is a global sports entertainment company. It is a game that anyone can play (and win). Score points by hitting micro-chipped golf balls at giant dartboard-like targets on an outfield. The closer you get your ball to the center or 'bullseye' and the further the distance, the more points earned. Making it competitive. Meanwhile they find ways to sell you food, beer, have a bar, sell merchandise, and host parties. Plus the locations across the country and world (UK and Australia) are really cool and look like something out of a sci-fi movie at night with all the cool lights. Below I posted pictures of the location. 

&amp;#x200B;

[TopGolf Location](https://preview.redd.it/n7tomtnlto361.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9aa87799d68b05fad89d38e8472b44845464bbe2)

&amp;#x200B;

[Outside the place view](https://preview.redd.it/1kdxq6lpto361.png?width=310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3e68c33ae2f759a26491589a79e4d0eb854e0a5)

Every time I have gone to this place day or night it is packed. Making reservations on a weekend night? Better fucking do it 14 months ahead of time if you even watch a shot at securing the reservation. They have 5 hour wait times on weekend nights and is open well into the morning and still have to turn away customers The place fucking sells and it is awesome. Way better then watching your wife fuck her boyfriend on a Friday night. These places are popular and are only going to grow as it is a fairly young acquisition. It was founded in the year 2000. Highly recommend you go to a Topgolf location, even my young non boomer ass who can't swing a driver to save his life thought it was a great time. Look at the fucking pictures and tell me you wouldn't take the family or boys out for a night to get fucked up and spend 100$ rather then 500$ because your broke ass keeps buying puts on TSLA. Well by doing this play....you can finally make enough money to afford a fun night at Topgolf and just maybe...MAYBE...your wife won't fuck her boyfriend for one night and give you a chance.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Valuation and reasoning for the run up:** Calloway is a 2.15 billion mid cap stock right now. It has been at these levels before and has retard strength momentum right now as it is trading at around 23 dollars a share. Earlier a few weeks ago it was at 16$..this has the possibility to be the next fucking meme stock for wallstreetbets but you autists won't pile into it because it seems to good to be true...but once again this will make you money rather then donating it to the wall street rich guys through TSLA puts. **The fact that it acquired Topgolf is a gamechanger. It made 1.1 billion dollars in revenue in 2019 and has grown at a 30% compound annual rate since 2017.** has made this stock (ELY) a fucking game changer. Morgan Stanley put a $30 price target on this stock in the next year. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only negative comment regarding the TopGolf merger I've seen is that ELY paid too much for the company, especially during a pandemic. This view is very shortsighted because back in 2017 ELY valued their 14% stake in TopGolf at a $2.1Billion valuation, which is before the company had 3 years of 30%/year growth. Other than the weak overvaluation argument, the analysts are unanimous in calling the TopGolf deal transformational to ELY and expect the company to deliver strong growth for many, many years. A vaccine or treatment for the virus should arriving soon, which would make the TopGolf deal suddenly undervalued again and send ELY shares to new highs. TopGolf is currently in hypergrowth mode, especially with their Top Tracer business which is only 1% penetrated worldwide. I listened to the merger conference call and it was obvious that the ELY CEO was being overly conservative in his projections, it sounded like the EBITDA projections he was giving was the bare minimum that the combined business will achieve. Definitely and under promise, over deliver scenario here. 

TopGolf rakes in money. Now Callaway equipment will be in front of everyone that walks through those doors. I understand the dilution worries but they acquired TopGolf for an incredible price. Looking long term this is a great acquisition to help them broaden their footprint.

Time to go balls deep in LEAPS and monthlys. 

Currently I am in 1/15/21 23$ calls

Title: SPLK vs ESTC Part V
4 months ago, before Q2 earnings, I started a  [  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iijc4h/coverage_on_splk_part_iv_aftermath/) coverage on SPLK, comparing it to ESTC 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i6jc7j/coverage\_on\_splk/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i6jc7j/coverage_on_splk/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i9wrpv/coverage\_on\_splk\_part\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i9wrpv/coverage_on_splk_part_2/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iea6hk/estc\_and\_splk\_earnings\_next\_week\_826\_amc\_saas/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iea6hk/estc_and_splk_earnings_next_week_826_amc_saas/)

Although ESTC doesn't compete directly with SPLK, certain market segments do overlap. Analyzing the SPLK tech stack, their moat is not in visualization nor data interface, but it's in making huge amount of data easily searchable and able to be aggregated, something ESTC does better.

On post Q2 earnings, the analysts were saying

[https://www.yahoo.com/news/splunk-slips-pre-market-revenue-095557873.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/splunk-slips-pre-market-revenue-095557873.html)

&gt;While optically it may seem as if SPLK missed its revenue target, cloud ARR is heading in the right direction which is the important metric investors should focus on, Eyal wrote in a note to investors. We expect SPLK to maintain a strong pace of revenue growth for some time to come, driven by growth in its cloud business, and we believe the company should be able to expand margins through operating leverage and efficiency gains"

My thought on this was

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iijc4h/coverage\_on\_splk\_part\_iv\_aftermath/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iijc4h/coverage_on_splk_part_iv_aftermath/)

&gt;"Bullshit, they paint it as if nobody can sell software anymore except as a cloud SaaS, this is definitely not the case. Look at ESTC, non cloud rev still growing along with top-line"

Then when Q3 results came in, everybody was acting surprised with some even filing lawsuits against SPLK

[https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/03/why-splunk-stock-was-slammed-on-thursday/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/03/why-splunk-stock-was-slammed-on-thursday/)

&gt;"Splunk's Q3 results and management's guidance for Q4 were both well below analysts' expectations. Revenue came in at $559 million, down 11% year over year. On average, analysts were expecting revenue of $613 million. Splunk also reported an adjusted loss per share of $1.26 -- far behind the $0.09 per share in profit analysts had been modeling for."

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholder-alert-splunk-inc-investigated-152200094.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholder-alert-splunk-inc-investigated-152200094.html)

&gt;"JPMorgan, who was blindsided by the magnitude of too many large deals slipping in the final days of October. Shares are presently down approximately 25% from their December 2, 2020 closing price, representing billions of dollars in lost market capitalization."

Why they all act surprised when Q3's results continues Q2 's trend and the stock plummeted 25% is beyond me. I'm guessing since SPLK is such a fund darling, they were stalling until they can divest enough to the retail crowd and state pension funds before revising the price target.

My main gripes with all the sell side analyst covering SaaS cloud companies, is that they always take a braindead cookie cutter MBA analysis of the company, just focusing on ARR and RPO without taking into consideration the Tech/operational side of the product. However for SPLK case, it was pretty obvious even from  Q2's financial results that their cloud ARR growth, which cost them a lot more compared to traditional licenses, won't make up for the declining on-prem license revenues

https://preview.redd.it/wc19qrxoho361.jpg?width=591&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3ede9b4d9ef04da261f8080cae8b35bff026417

In Contrast to ESTC, which recorded revenue rise across the board even in traditional on-prem license revenue

https://preview.redd.it/uf7wkczpho361.jpg?width=593&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e34b9c463d736a301f574c55c3648215b20a24ea

From an IT management perspective, for a CIO/CSO, ESTC have made it possible for literally almost anybody to implement SPLK-like functionality in their IT-OPS environment. Rather then buying expensive SPLK cloud or on prem license,just use ESTC opensource or buy the basic license, and have either someguy in bangalore or poland to implement the visualization and data interface for 150 bucks a day.

An ESTC base license + 40 man days at cheap outsourcing rate, you'll get a solution 2x as flexible as SPLK at 10 percent of SPLK's TCO.

# TL,DR: Long ESTC PT 160, SHORT SPLK PT 110

Title: If you want to sell options, these are what you should be selling...
Over at r/reddittickers we have been collecting and analyzing data from popular subreddits. This week I am looking at the options contracts that have been mentioned on the subreddits we track.  Specifically, I am looking at contracts expiring this Friday 12/11.    The data collected for this analysis was collected from 11/29  12/5.  For Fridays expiration there are 186 contracts and 330 mentions of these contracts.  The most popular contract is the 12/11 TSLA 600 Call with 14 mentions.  


The goal here is to track what reddit is following and to see how reddit preforms.  There is this notion that retail investors often fail to beat the market. This is why financial advisors recommend that you buy into the major ETFs such as SPY.  As historically there have been few people that manage to beat the major Indexs year over year.  My hypothesis going into this week is that I should bet against the trends on reddit as typically the retail investor is wrong.  


Call Data


* Out of the 186 contracts 150 are calls (+80%+ Long)  

* 75.3% of the calls are out of the money

* The out of the money Calls are an average of 23% out of the money. 

* The in the money calls are an average of 19.3% in the money. 


Put Data


* Out of 186 Contracts 36 are puts

* 86.1% of the puts are out of the money

* The out of the money puts are an average of 20% out of the money

* The in the money puts are an average of 8% in the money 


On both the call and put sides the out of the money contracts are an average of 20%+ out of the money.  I am not that surprised as there is a lot of yolo culture on reddit.  It is surprising to see the number of contracts that are out of the money in general.  Out of the 186 contracts only 42 are in the money as of last Fridays close. 

The most popular calls that are in the money are the 

* TSLA 570  590 
* ACB 10.  

The most popular puts that are in the money are all NKLA.  

The most popular calls that are out of the money are the 

* TSLA 600 - 650,

As I said above my hypothesis going into this week is that the majority of these contracts will end up being losers.  Based on this data I would probably look to sell the 370 Spy Calls and TSLA 600 calls if my hypothesis turns out to be right.  For now this is just for fun, but I will be running more in-depth analysis to see if I find anything interesting. 

If you are interested in the full dataset I could potentially post it somewhere.

Title: Why your next stock purchase better be HYLN

Many of you know that the next big move in EV's is who can take the biggest share of the transportation industry. I'm not talking about your mom taking you to the nearest autism center, I'm talking about the transportation of moving your favorite fidget spinner into your Gay Bear hands.

**bold** Why HYLN when Tesla providing trucks soon you fuck???

Very simple answer, Tesla trucks are nice and all but they have two major limiting factors. 
1. The truck range is only 500 miles (Hyliion's ERX is 1300 miles)
 2. CHARGING A SEMI IS NOT THE SAME AS CHARGING YOUR MODEL S E X OR Y. 

Many reports have come out that state that to charge a tesla truck, it would require revamping entire grids to support those key charging areas. Now imagine when you have to deliver something to bumfuck nowhere, aint gonna be no efficient chargers. The technology just isn't there yet. 

https://www.greenbiz.com/article/electric-truck-fleets-will-need-lot-power-utilities-arent-planning-it

Ok, what does Hyliion do to "solve" this problem. Simple. They use natural gas. NATURAL GAS??? WHAT? Yes natural gas. There is already 700+ natural gas stations around the United States, that means that it can easily travel anywhere it needs to, and it is much easier to establish new natural gas stations than it is to revamp electrical grids for tesla chargers, (think of how long its taking to fix flint's water) 

Additionally, it uses an onboard generator under the hood so that when you are driving, IT IS ALSO CHARGING THE BATTERY, this means that the range of a hyliion ERX truck is 1300 miles with an increased payload than Tesla's semi truck. You probably don't know this but many truck companies send out truck drivers in pairs, because of regulations, one drives while the other rests. With tesla trucks you can't do that since it only goes for 500 miles, they would need to stop and charge, while hyliion ERX truck will keep on going.

Also Hyliion's products are actually net negative carbon emissions. HOW? When cows fart, they give off methane (a pollutant), which is used to create natural gas. As our population grows, more meat eaters, more cows, more methane. Natural gas takes methane out the air and powers shit. Hyliion uses natural gas, that means using hyliion products not only produce clean efficient energy, you are also rapidly removing methane out of the air, a net negative carbon emission.

Now their current amazing product that Hyliion produces is that they  convert the rear axle of EXISITING TRUCKS to electric. Many companies do not want to do the jump in EV because they have already spent millions on their existing trucks. Well that whole market is up for grabs for hyliion because their product will give those existing trucks a 10-30% fuel cost reduction and will give them more torque and power so that when they go up hill, they have a much easier time than now. Additionally they use algorithms to help the driver get the most efficient drive possible and gives them points, think of a mini game for those truckers. 


**bold** Yo autismo, I just saw their stock and it dipped massively recently, what happened???

Hyliion on November 30th announced that they will redeem their public warrants. Now some people can say that's bad, others say that they are using that extra ~~144 million that they will receive to finish up their infrastructure etc. Either way, do you want to buy on a day its up 50% or do you wanna buy when the stock is red???

NOW IS AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO BUY THE STOCK FOR LOW PRICES.

The stock had a 20-40% short ratio against it in the past week, and it refused to break the $18 support level. It is itching to go up from here once the news of the warrants are settled. 

I am in at 100 shares and buying 600 more in the upcoming days.

TLDR: YOUR NEXT STOCK PURCHASE BETTER BE HYLIION DO NOT MESS UP ON THE NEXT TESLA TRAIN. BUYBUYBUY

(I LOVE TESLA AS MUCH AS THE NEXT BULL BUT HYLIION TAKES THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY)

*italics* P.S. I AM NOT AN EXPERT, BUT I BELIEVE IN THIS STOCK

Title: buy the fuck out of UPS
listen boys, I work as a truck loader in my local UPS warehouse. its a pretty big one, probably top 40% in size, amount of employees, and volume of all of their warehouses. the warehouse has 4 centers. the center I work in has about 20-25 preloaders on shift per day. each preloaders loads 4 trucks. in my warehouse, the expected volume each preloader is supposed to handle is somewhere around 180 packages per hour. over a standard 5 hour shift, that's about 900 packages. 

me and every one of the other loaders in my center handle about 1500 per day. 

this shit is gonna pop at the next earnings report, buy the fuck in.

Title: Airbnb (ABNB) Game Plan
Alright bois, here's what I think will happen with the ABNB IPO (I'm the guy that made the RKT game plan post and made a nice 25 percent profit off it).

I think it will be a similar situation as the BigC (Big Commerce) IPO a couple months ago with the hype surrounding it. Basically, what we know right now is that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will be leading the selling of the initial offering. Here's how I think it will play out.

When the IPO opens, they will only release around 20-30 percent of the planned initial offering. This is to drive up the share price because of the amount of demand there will be in the beginning of the IPO. Then they will dump the rest of the shares about 10-15 minutes after the IPO when it is most likely up 15-20 percent.

Here's the plan:

Immediately after the IPO, I am going to buy as many shares as I possibly can (as long as the premium isn't some crazy 4x shit). In exactly 10 minutes (I won't sell no matter what happens before then), if the share price has move more than 15 percent (up or down), I will sell out. Otherwise, I'll start setting levels to sell at.

Title:   PSTH and the Ever Present Difficulty in Finding the Signal Over the Noise - FINTECH Unicorn DD 2.0 
**  PSTH DD 2.0 - Revisited with New Interpretation  **

**I have written a pinned DD previously on this topic here:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3bf1o/psth\_dd\_klarman\_buffet\_ackman\_the\_unicorn\_hunter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3bf1o/psth_dd_klarman_buffet_ackman_the_unicorn_hunter/) 

Many, many of you have DMd asking for updates and thoughts. Others have posted rebuttals to my original DD in the community. I thank each of you for your thoughtful analysis. I think we've sorted out a lot in the last week. A special thanks to YOLO, who, whether right or wrong, has provided a lot of context on twitter (@YoloCapitalMgmt).

While I have remained somewhat quiet on many of the subsequent points of speculation, I wanted to say a few things before the week begins and provide an update.

Along those lines, this is a response to all of you in the form of an updated DD. Given all that has happened since my OG DD 7 days ago, its warranted and I hope you chose to upvote on the merits of the post quality.

There is a bit of a focus on the Klarman position in PSTH here for a few reasons: a) there has not been a lot reported on this and b) its incredibly interesting that one hedge fund manager makes such a large deposit in a competitors experimental vehicle. A second point of interest here is the role Jackie Reses is playing, one we may be significantly underestimating, despite YOLO's work.

\--------------------

**Background**

In July of 2020, William Bill SPACMAN Ackman took the blank cheque company Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd (PSTH) public. The fund raised a record-breaking $4B, becoming the biggest SPAC ever. Investors on the books include big fellas like Seth Klarman and the revered Baupost Group who have invested an astounding $400M position (their biggest to date). Other notables include Guggenheim with a half a billion investment, as well as the Ontario teachers union. There is an extremely large outstanding position as well that has yet to be disclosed.

The stock opened at $20 (NAV). Over the course of the last few weeks it has risen steadily in value and now sits at around $26. Much of this rise, and the new 52 week high (&gt;$27) happened early last week following a lot of online speculation over the weekend regarding Stripe, a private unicorn fintech company run by two Irish brothers, the Collisons.

**DD Updates**

1. New information has emerged related to Klarman views on Stripe and CB that hadnt previously been reported by our community. In an investor letter he wrote: " C R Y P T O seem more like tulip bulbs for the digital age." With respect to Stripe, some have made mention of comments hes made in the past in terms of being bullish on stripe. 

2. Again, with respect to the Klarman and the stripe position there are other important pieces of information to think about. Specifically, what Stripe has said about c r y p t o in the past. Taken from the article above, Stripe wrote in a blog post: "Transaction confirmation times have risen substantially; this, in turn, has led to an increase in the failure rate of transactions denominated in fiat currencies," Stripe said in a blog post. "Fees have risen a great deal. For a regular B i t C transaction, a fee of tens of U.S. dollars is common, making B i t C transactions about as expensive as bank wires." Some reasonable contemplation here would lead to some obvious conclusions about the likelihood (lack thereof) of a CB PSTH merger.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**New Interpretations**

 Jackie Reses is someone we have underestimated. Those more knowledgeable have posted in the other PSTH threads explaining just how big of a player she is in fintech. Her joining PSTH board is gigantic and confirms that Ackman is targeting a fintech. The baseless rumors around food service industry do not \*square\* this circle. She is there for to attract a fintech unicorn and to help it grow. It is incredibly advantageous for Ackman as he will get her on the board, and he has someone he can trust in the Stripe boardroom without going all activist which is what they are worried about.

 The more we read about Klarman, the more obvious it is that he is not jumping in on something that is uncertain. There are a few points to make here. In the past he has said the following. Secondly, we know when he got in which was at an avg price of around $22.40. He could have been in at $20. Why wasnt he? Certainty is why. He bought in around Q3, after the AirBnB talks were confirmed to be dead. No one knows wtf is going on with AirBnB and that was likely why he may have been hesitant (or just not interested at all in it). In the subsequent weeks, Ackman and Stripe had preliminary talks, Ackman made some comments on Stripe not being ready, they made some comments on twitter and in the press and then they went on a hiring spree for public play. What happens just around that time? Klarmans Baupost buys $400M stake putting 5% of their AUM into PSTH. Ackman is completely able to chat with his investors on how negotiations are going. Something happened in October that we are unaware of.

 Stripe and PSTH do not stand to benefit from the hype online if they both know now that this deal is a at 0% of happening. The hype surrounding Stripe is what has led to the new PSTH highs. Literally that is all thats happened recently that would lead to such dramatic changes in the stock price and after-hours volumes. Going forward, Stripe would benefit from squashing this deal super early in the press to soften that blow and get investors in a comfy spot again in terms of reasonable expectations. They have not done so. Ackman was on twitter this weekend and said nothing. He gave an interview last week talking about how bullish he is on FNMA but said nothing about Stripe when asked about the SPAC. Similarly, Stripe has not outright denied the deal happening. Why is this important? 1) they easily could have 2) their employees are following Ackman, and this would be a huge distraction to their workforce (incentive to crush the rumor). Ultimately, this may not be evidence that talks are ongoing, but it is suspicious. Additionally, they have been floating the valuation during interviews with the press. Just like Ackman saying they are not ready from a public managerial perspective, they could be simply negotiating here, upping the ask price for an in.

 Finally, on the point about Stripes new valuation. Astute investors and researchers will have stumbled across this Bloomberg article. It clearly argues the risks that come with going this route re: funding. https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-11-25/a-100-billion-valuation-poses-risk-for-silicon-valley-fintech-star-stripe

A few very interesting points from the article that we should consider carefully:

o Shares in Stripe's Dutch rival Adyen have more than doubled in value since the start of the year, outperforming Europe's benchmark index.

o That has allowed Adyen to charge less than Stripe, since its more affordable to scale your services for large clients than for a panoply of smaller ones.

o The new funding round might give the Collisons the choice of pushing any prospective initial public offering further down the line, but a punchy private valuation might also make such a delay necessary. If e-commerce growth slows once life returns to a semblance of normality, then justifying a $100 billion valuation to the public markets could be tougher.

 This is relevant for a couple of reasons. It sheds light on the issues with such a huge jump in valuation now and the potential problems they may face in the future in justifying that valuation (even if a potential IPO is 2 years out for them, for example) when e-commerce boom from covid slows down a bit. That is not to say Stripe is a monster that will do well, but it is to say theres something to be said for not putting the cart before the horse, or the unicorn in this case.

\--------------------------------------------------------------

**Concluding Remarks**

In closing, PSTH offers Stripe a unique opportunity to evade a lot of this nonsense and collect public investors who will stick with them over the long term. The investment in a PSTH deal for 15% of the company will serve them well in the future as the company can grow on its own terms and focus on the product and not be distracted by the markets. It also lets them get in within 45 days of signing the LOI, while this boom is still happening.

Thats all for now folks. I expect to see another massive gap up tomorrow in this stock. The trend started last week, and this play isnt falling off anyones radar. Good luck. Its going to be a wild week.

Title: All we want for Christmas is more Kohl. The bullish case for retail giant KSS
Hello my fellow Retards, lick your wounds from last week its time to ~~lose~~ make more money,  

Hopefully a few of you read and benefited from my DD and predictions from my [SPG](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i9wlle/simon_property_group_spg_is_about_to_lift_off) post in the past.     Lately, aside from getting my lunch and shirt stolen by PLTR I have been [playing options ](https://imgur.com/a/jzSJxrL)around the insane [Kohl's comeback](https://i.imgur.com/8tx1CBf.png) (and retail/REIT's in general tbf) that has seemingly gone completely unnoticed here.  Now, I do believe we are in for a week of market consolidation very soon all around but I have reason to believe Kohls might be trending towards pre-corona highs over the next 2 months and potentially all time highs over the next year. 

Hear me out autists, we should all have Kohl in our stockings this Christmas.  

#  KSS is not done climbing.

First off, in case you missed it: &gt;!Kohls (KSS) is up +25% the PAST WEEK  and 92% over the PAST MONTH!&lt;. *What the fuck? -* is right my friend. - KSS currently trades at $40.90 after finishing an absolute burner of a week on the heels of announcing their new combination store deal with Sephora makeup, you know that expensive lipstick your wife puts on to meet her boyfriend but wont touch for you? Ya them, they are coming to a Kohls stores near you next year and trust me when I say this: **The full scope of the increased customer exposure between this and their overlooked Amazon Return system has not been realized by the market yet**,  they are still criminally undervalued from where they were before Coronavirus in spite of returning to profit.   

**Store retail is not dead you fucking idiot**

Kohls is a fucking comeback king.   If you think in-store retail is dead or dying then you actually need to get out of your basement at least once over the weekend to see for yourself how alive and well it is. KSS has emerged several times in the past through various economic downturns- they were among the first retail giant to whether the 2009 recession return to profit- and if you have use of the brain behind that helmet you can see they are [balls deep in a thick bull erection](https://i.imgur.com/blpRGL8.png) and doing it again.  They have made and absorbed all the necessary costs to maintain an open store in the face of the pandemic and somehow maintained a cash positive balance sheet on the year despite losing out on nearly a quarter of shopping days this calendar year.   BULLISH AF**.**

**Retail Consolidation favors the big boys**

KSS is not sitting still while others have already fallen or shuttered - they have been among the most proactive department stores in adapting to the shifting consumer habits in the retail sector and I wouldnt be the least bit surprised to see KSS reach all time highs (70+) by Q3 2022 or even sooner.  *Their staying power has been solidified* through this turmoil and the financial illiquidity of their competitors *(R.I.P JcPenney gang*) who continue to shutter only presents less alternative consumer options.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY TAKE**

My bull erection peaked for them during the last earnings call when the CEO reinstated the annual dividend which gave us the first clear internal indicator that they believe the worst is behind them. 

&gt;*Our third-quarter results exceeded our expectations with significant sequential sales and profitability improvement. We also further enhanced our financial position during the quarter, driven by solid operating cash flow.* ***We ended the quarter with more than $1.9 billion in cash and no amount outstanding on our revolver****. Based on the progress we are making and through disciplined capital management, we are pleased to share that we plan to reinstate a dividend during the first half of 2021*. - Michelle Gass, CEO

&amp;#x200B;

  **EARNINGS FOR NEXT QUARTER WILL EXCEED ANALYST EXPECTATIONS** 

[Earnings momentum](https://i.imgur.com/W3mlxOa.png) is a nerd formula that measures the acceleration or deceleration over a trailing 12 month operating of earnings per share growth - an upward curvature of the plotted points indicates that while earnings declined, due to a fucking pandemic, the recent momentum shows rapid acceleration in quarterly growth rate when adjusted for their earnings and market volatility.  

**TLDR**: An improvement in future earnings growth, and a faster than expected recovery is highly likely from their current position almost guaranteed actually.  

With the new Sephora deal bringing insanely positive news, just before an expected Christmas retail run.  Investor sentiment is going to remain high and Nat King Kohl is about to bring Christmas joy to all of us.    

&amp;#x200B;

**PREDICTION:**

 **KSS** is about to flex towards pre-corona valuation levels in the next month of trading **(46.00+) (+15%) AND WILL REACH (55+) BY DEC. 2021**

**POSITIONS:** 

**- 500 Shares @ 25.5**

**Shares will likely return +14-18% over the next 60 day trading window.**  

[Options](https://i.imgur.com/wx2Mf5Y.png) **are extremely expensive right now due to the IV runup from last week, so hope for a pullback or a drop next week to enter anything for 1/15.**  Know that this play is safe so when the market starts tanking wait for your entry point   

&amp;#x200B;

**KSS 12/24 40c and 39c**

**KSS 1/15 40c and 39c**

**KSS 1/21/22  45/50c**

Godspeed retards, happy trading

Title: $GME Earnings 12/8/20  Will Gamestopss Shops Shock the Stock?
**Its 12/8/20 and youre sitting at home in the middle of your 500 sqft apartment in the throes of the third wave of the COVID-flu Pandemic. Like the tens of thousands former $DIS corporation cast members, youve been laid off for months and are bored out of your fucking mind. Who knows how youll pay for rent next week? Having stretched your $1,200 Trump bucks as far as possible, youve begun considering cashing in and seeing if theres a market for Sheriff Woody on OnlyFans. You always knew it would come to this; you think to yourself as you gaze upon your old $DIS corporation costume. 

Fortunately, before you can hit submit, an old buddy, Tom Nook, calls you up to drop a fat tip. Thats right, good old Tom got a job working for $GME Stop, and theyre hiring people just like you. After a quick 5 minute conversation, youve got a new job. Even better, the company respects your rights, given by God, and doesnt require you wear a mask or submit to humiliating health and wellness checks every morning like Biden supporters and the Fake News love to do. 

Much like investors in $GME Stops stock, youve hit the jackpot. Everythings going to be OK; the only Woody youll be sharing this Christmas is with your store manager in the stock room.
The COVID-flu hit traditional brick and mortar retail stores like a songbird flying 28 mph into a lit window at night. While most retailers were grossly unprepared to handle the drop in sales and health risks associated with this event, $GME Stop had nothing to lose. In a world where swans are black and coronavirus is fake, $GME Stop has ignored health and safety recommendations, putting shareholder value first while competitors have been duped and distracted by fads such as face masks and toilet paper. Furthermore, $GME Stop has been a bastion of hope for other brick and mortar retailers to aspire to - with more than one PS5 in stock on Black Friday unlike the other stores near me like Best Buy ($BBY) or Target ($TGT) who discouraged us from camping out and required face coverings on threat of expulsion. 
**
With new VR and 3D TV technologies on the horizon, and the rise of Mobile Gaming, institutions are sure to be clamoring for $GME Stop shares after earnings on Tuesday. Its undeniable, millions of Americans are sitting at home and the demand for adult entertainment has only continued to grow during these difficult times. From the hottest consoles to the sexiest Switch games, $GME Stop is well positioned to pleasure and delight customers across the globe for many years to come.

**TLDR; $GME Stop may shock shorts and pop after inspiring investors to embrace their animal spirits following earnings on Tuesday.**

Title: Jews and Gingers - A Degenerate's guide to investing $3,000,000 in PSTH Conjecture
# The Synopsis - Nothing new, just wrapping it in a bow

Alright Handi-Capables, buckle up - I am going to tell you about a little WSB speculation that may be either the biggest fraud of all time or the most epic DD ever to have occurred in WSB history. A lot of this information comes from a real dick head named Yolo Capital Management on Twitter who is also known as u/infamousbreadfruit99  within this Gamblers subreddit. This guy is a real piece of work, but I've come to have a real good working relationship with him as we've discussed theories behind Pershing Square as well as the most hyped target being discussed, STRIPE. This thread is really meant to just outline all the history, the theories, the risks and the potential moves that you can do to minimize risk. **I don't want this to turn into the great NRPLing of 2020, where PURPLE had the best quarter of all time but you Degenerates all sold off because they didn't announce an electric vehicle or an Ipad powered exercise bike. Warning to all: This is purely speculation, this SPAC is trading at 30% above NAV which is pretty damn unprecedented without any news. So be cautious as the downside might be 5-6 dollars per share should Bill announce a terrible DUD of a target. This post is not advice, really just general information that I am trying to present in an un-biased way. PSA:  I am biased as hell though, hence my 3M investment, although I don't buy all the theories presented by some people on the forums. Also, there is a very good possibility that this SPAC doesn't acquire STRIPE.**

First of all, for those of you not aware, PSTH is a SPAC led by Bill Ackman **(A very successful billionaire  Jew, hence the title - Not an anti-Semitic post, genuinely aligns with the theory of an announcement soon)**. A SPAC is a special acquisition company that aspired to bring a company public through a reverse merger. The new entity receives a cash infusion and the SPAC holders shares become stock units in the company that trade on the open Market. SPACS are essentially just a giant cash reserve used to purchase a company. This particular SPAC IPO'd with Units being traded for 20.00 and 20.00 NAV in the trust. The units have since split into Warrants and Shares. As of last week, warrants were trading in the high single digits and shares were trading just below 26.00. Regardless of what the stock trades at, the NAV will remain fairly constant at 20.00 per share. For discussions sake, I am going to consider 20.00 as the theoretical floor as it would be very unusual for a Pre-Merger SPAC to drop drastically below NAV. Once a SPAC merges, the 20.00 floor is removed and market demand and market conditions determine the share price going forward. There have been many theoretical questions thrown around about how much this will jump on an announcement and the answer is **that no one knows until the terms of the deal are announced.**

# The SPAC Structure and Anchor Investors

Now that we have this out of the way, let's talk about Bill Ackman's SPAC. This SPAC launched on July 22nd, 2020, the SPAC sold 200,000,000 units for a total trust size of 4 Billion USD. There were additional clauses in this filing that allow for even more units to be issued to increase the buying power of the SPAC to somewhere in the 7B range. The SPAC was subscribed by some very Reputable investors. Investors Included :

&amp;#x200B;

[Largest Institutional Investors](https://preview.redd.it/p0lmr68tel361.png?width=1317&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94857b6901ef98c609b21940244d5b962098142a)

As you can see, you have some whale investors that include Wells Fargo, Baopost hedge fund, Soroban capital and Guggenheim. Well over 2B dollars is held by these 12 investors. According to the filing, institutions own about 65% of the public float. On Bill Ackmans last hedge fund call he indicated that because there was so much interest in this SPAC, he was able to hand pick his investors. Many of these investors are likely sovereign wealth funds or family offices that do not file and therefore we have no insight into whom they are, but Bill does.

Each one of these investors owns common stock that was likely issued after the units split. For those of you that aren't aware, this SPAC has 3/9 of a common warrant per share. 1/9 was issued during the split from the units and the other 2/9 are issued to common share holders that hold through a merger. These warrants have a 23.00 strike price and they can be redeemed after the stock trades above 36.00 for a defined time period. If you don't know what a warrant is just ignore this paragraph.

This SPAC was designed with very favorable terms that ensure the sponsor's goals align with the company goals and don't create a conflict of interest. Many Many Many Many SPACs have very favorable terms that leave the sponsor's rich and the investors holding bags. 

This is a very very good article that defines conflicts of interest within SPACS. PSTH has eliminated many of these issues and Bill Ackman's interest align with ours, in fact Bill can't make money until the investors reach a certain threshold of gains.

[https://www.sewkis.com/publications/spacs-are-back-back-again-what-you-should-know/](https://www.sewkis.com/publications/spacs-are-back-back-again-what-you-should-know/)

This SPAC hard garnered many anchor investors and its structure is very very favorable as compared to its peers. Bill is setting a new precedent in the SPAC world and it will be interesting to see if other sponsors do the same. This is a key differentiating factor as to why this SPAC is very premium.

# Targets and Timing

When this SPAC first launched, Bill Ackman indicated that he would likely find a target within 6 months and merge shortly thereafter. Bill also indicated that he was looking for a minority interest in a unicorn that met certain criteria. Here is the criteria as pulled directly from Pershing Square's website. On the last Pershing earnings call, it was indicated that Bill so no reason that he wouldn't meet his original timeline of having a target announced by Q1 and a merger by Q2. January 22nd is the official 6 month milestone from when the SPAC first began trading.

 

* **Simple, predictable, and free-cash-flow-generative.**We will generally seek companies with a proven track record of growth and free cash flow generation, and predictable future financial performance that we expect will generate strong, sustainable growth in cash flows over the long termhowever, we are open to considering a company that may, at the time of the initial business combination, be cash-flow negative, if we believe that the businesss cash flow will become positive within a reasonable amount of time;
* **Formidable barriers to entry.**We will seek companies that have long-term sustainable competitive advantages, significant barriers to entry, or wide moats around their business, and low risks of disruption due to competition, innovation or new entrants;
* **Limited exposure to extrinsic factors that we cannot control**. We will seek companies that are not materially affected by macroeconomic factors, commodity prices, regulatory risks, interest rate volatility and/or cyclical risk;
* **Strong balance sheet**. We will seek companies that are conservatively financed relative to their free-cash-flow generation, after taking into consideration thede-leveragingeffects of the initial business combination;
* **Minimal capital markets dependency**. We will seek companies that can benefit from being a public company with broader access to the capital markets and greater governance, but will prefer companies that are not highly reliant on the capital markets to operate and grow their businesses;
* **Large capitalization**. We will seek companies with large enterprise values and significant long-term growth potential that will be likely candidates for inclusion in the S&amp;P 500 index;
* **Attractive valuation**. We will seek companies at an attractive valuation relative to their long-term intrinsic value; and
* **Exceptional management and governance**. We will seek companies that have trustworthy, talented, experienced, and highly competent management teams. These companies may be led by entrepreneurs who are looking for a partner with our expertise to execute on the next stage of their growth. For target companies that require new management, we will leverage PSCMs experience in identifying and recruiting new management.

After providing this criteria, Bill indicated there were likely 150 companies that were considered mature unicorns and \~50 of them would meet all of Bill's criteria. Also, Bill indicated there may be other potential targets that are subsidiaries of other companies. 

According to the World Wide Web, here are the list of some potential unicorns.

# The Stripe Conjecture - Initialize Tin Foil Hats

If you don't want to hear the theories, then stop reading now as this is just going to really summarize many interesting snippets of information that don't necessarily mean anything but are certainly interesting.

* Jackie Reses Stepping down from Square and maintaining a board seat on PSTH
   * Jackie was the head of capital for square
   * Stripe just launched Capital
   * Jackie is a baller and has more big Dick energy than any man, woman or child alive when it comes to finance.
   * Jackie has liked several PSTH related tweets, but she has also like other tweets about other financial institutions. This might just be purely coincidence.
   * Why would Jackie step down from Square but retain all her other board seats, including those on Chamanth's SPACS. Is there a conflict of interest?
* Bill Ackman following Collison Brothers on Twitter, he doesn't even follow the CEO's of all his biggest investments.
   * Bill only follows 182 people
   * Bill Doesn't follow the CEO of Lowes
   * Bill Doesn't follow the CEO of Chipotle, as far as I can tell - CEO's twitter appears to be private
   * Bill Doesn't follow Hilton's account, CEO doesn't have twitter as far as I can tell
   * Bill DOES follow starbucks CEO
   * Bill Doesn't follow Agilent CEO
   * Bill Doesn't follow Howard Hughes companies or leadership as far as I can tell
* John Collison Following Breadfruit on Twitter (Yolocapitalmgmt)
   * This dude is a billionaire that is following a WSB degenerate posting conspiracy theories.
   * &amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/syzsbimcpl361.png?width=670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1cdaf5940156de2aabad55172ce983a3cf57674

* Global head of security was following Breadfruit on Twitter
   * This dude is one of the original Irish stripe employees.... he has since unfollowed but he was. His name is Brian Delahunty
* Wells FARGO invested in a PRE LOI SPAC - What the hell?
   * This is the one that I can't figure out. Why in the hell would wells FARGO invest in a shell company if they didn't have any inclination as to the target. HAS THIS EVER HAPPENED BEFORE? We know that wells fargo and stripe do have a relationship
* SETH KLARMAN INVESTED IN A PRE LOI SPAC
   * This is another ODD one. This is basically Seth Klarman saying hey Bill, your Hedge fund can invest my 400 million better than me?????????????? These are two different hedge fund manager and one of them is investing in the other. This is absolutely weird.
* The size of the SPAC limits targets: why so big Bill???????
   * Why in the world would Bill limit his options to such a small amount of companies, companies that are typically already backed by big money...... This is another point I can't wrap my head around, why in the world would bill launch a SPAC of this size without having preliminary top level talks. The sheer size of the SPAC is telling, he knew he wanted a whale and if he didn't think he could get one he would've maybe gone with a 2B dollar SPAC with the option to increase to 4B, INSTEAD he went with a 4B SPAC with option to go all the way to 7B!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
* Why would the Collison brothers have talks at all with Bill if they didn't intend to go public? The brothers are some smart as Ginger Snaps and they knew Bill had a giant ass blank check. Many people are saying the collison brothers will IPO and they don't need Bill... Why waste your time meeting with Bill then if SPACing wasn't a possibility and going public wasn't a near term event?
* Why hasn't Bill or the Collison's denied it
   * Bloomberg denied rumors within an hour
   * Airbnb Denied rumors within days
   * Not a single Denial statement from Collisons or Big Dick Bill.
* Collison Brothers are going for funding at a much higher valuation
   * Why would they be going for funding, they just got funding in April. Also, it's rumored that Stripe is potentially already profitable.
* Bill Ackman indicated his biggest regret was missing the boat on Mastercard
* Bill Ackman is taking a minority stake so the terms are more appealing to unicorns as they can maintain control, raise funding and have large anchor investors that aren't worried about short term gains.

# The ANTITHESIS to the conjecture

* John Collison is trolling - If there was a deal why would John troll.
* The Collisons just indicated they were not preparing a flotation.
   * &amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d7v47h1btl361.png?width=643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d637174323dd1c70c0e87ec31aa06a2bca601b6e

* The Collisons are a freaking darling that can raise private equity whenever they want, they really don't need Bill
* Jackie Reses has trolled Breadfuit AKA Yolo on twitter
* STRIPE doesn't need funding
* Bill Ackman's historical investments are not fintech, why would he start
* Big Unicorns don't want bill because he is an activist.

# The Risk to Reward

* You need to be aware that this is trading at a 30% premium to asset value. This means that for every share you buy at 26.00, there is only 20.00 of money in the trust being used to acquire the company. This means that we need to land a good company with good terms to justify the premium.
* This SPAC is huge, it's not likely to quadruple like some of the other spacs. 
   * If a great deal is reached with a real hype company then we might see 35-40 pre merger and 40+ post merger. Otherwise, we will probably see 30-35, depending on the terms.
* The SPAC has 2 years to make a deal and we are only \~5 months into this duration. Your money could sit idle for another 18 months.
* Warrants expire worthless should a deal fail to materialize. This is why I am not specifically buying warrants, although I do expect a deal will materialize.

# Why I invested

* I like Bill Ackman, he gets it done, he is smart, pragmatic and he learns from his mistakes.
* This is really an investment in Bill, similar to investing in TSLA, it's really an investment in leadership, not so much the product.
* Bill does have a relationship with some big players and he will land a good deal no matter what. Even if this is not Stripe, I will likely hold everything long term.
* Tontine structure is appealing and it rewards holders. Google Tontine if you don't know what it is.
* If they do get Stripe, you are getting Young visionary leadership and frankly I think the Collison's are probably stand up guys. In the back of my mind, I believe that they might SPAC to give the average joe an opportunity to invest; they seem more motivated in building an empire of amazing financial infrastructure products than getting egregious valuations
* If they Don't get Stripe you are still getting Bill Ackman and Jackie Reses hunting for a company - they are both legends.
* Anchor investors presented above indicate they are bullish on Bill, not to mention they limit the available float and if it is a epic deal, anchor investors holding will help push price of stock upwards.

# The Plays

* I am only buying commons.
* For those that want options, I wouldn't buy any options earlier than a march '21 expiration and a 20.00 strike.
* If I were buying options I would buy June expiration 15.00 strikes.
* My previous posts outline why I believe just buying common stock is the way to go. Ticker is PSTH.

# MY POSITIONS

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5uqhlk10wl361.png?width=1512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aeb0553b3ecb7ed0bb7d145ad6bb1cb08e3047dc

# TL:DR

* Bill will probably buy Subway and we're all FK'd.
* Don't buy because it might be stripe, buy because it's Bill and Jackie.
* Don't buy lotto's as I don't believe this SPAC won't react like others.
* This isn't investing advice. This is my thought process spewed about on a forum.

MODS- Not sure if this qualifies as DD or not, but if it doesn't PM me and I will change it to story time or shitpost.

Title: Micron Technologies to the Moon
So real old heads remember everyone's favorite meme stock from 2017. This bad boy was pulling in money left and right and was trading at a sexy P/E of under 14$. Micron Technologies was trading under 10 bucks before our man main entered the picture, Swag Master Sanjay Mehrotra in 2017 and ever since Micron Technologies has boomed to a beautiful 72$. So what is Micron technologies, and why is it going to make you rich:

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Micron Technology?**

They're a company that specializes in producing NAND flash Semiconductors. Think the type of semi conductors used in your USBs, memory cards, cell phones and other small devices that lack the sizes for larger forms of dedicated storage. 

**What has been happening during the Rona**?:

Micron crashed in February in anticipation of a decline of the global NAND market due to Corona's effects on the supply chain. However this disrupted China's ability to flood the market with semi-conductors and as a result allowed Micron to gobble up a huge amount of the market share. Another [WSBs DD post put it better than I could](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7emhl/micron_technology_mu_dd/). Go read his post as well to get a better idea of what''s been happening over the last few months with Micron:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The memory trough has finally bottomed. Micron did not lose money. How do I know it has bottomed? Earnings from other tech companies. They have been investing in data centers because the new hot technology is AI. Artificial intelligence require massive CPU, memory, and storage. Magnetic disk is so 1980s, its all about NAND today. Who makes the hottest NAND? Intel and Micron collaborated on 3D XPoint (think Intel Optane). Its 1000x faster than NAND, last 1000X longer, and 10X as dense. Its basically not volatile DRAM, something to power the AI revolution.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Oh yeah, Micron just bought out Intels share of 3DXPoint for 1.5B. The only manufacturing for 3DXPoint is in Utah. Thats right, not in China! So now I segue into the Mexican Beer virus. The majority of memory manufacturers are centered in the Wuhan area. The Wuhan area is basically shut down for the foreseeable future. Hmmm which memory maker makes memory mostly outside China? If you said Micron, you win the prize. They have manufacturing locations in Idaho (you da hoe), Utah, Virginia, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Xian China. They have only one location in China, and its not even in Wuhan.

Not only did Micron use Corona as an opportunity to expand its market share, [but the dip in NAND memory demand was temporary and it returned to its upward trend](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/nand-flash-market-is-rebounding-faster-than-the-dram-market). Not only did demand increase; but the supply retracted as manufacturers in China and other Corona hit areas suspended operations as seen by this chart (you might have to click on it to see it closer)

&amp;#x200B;

[Notice that oversupply is steadily declining](https://preview.redd.it/v8814125il361.png?width=328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=820a650b6d82e238d8d9ffa53030961d59deeb68)

**Diversification and Innovation**:

[Here's an interview with the Swag Master himself:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLl3b7SMUBk) 

They've been able to make big bucks diversifying into data centers which have boomed with work from home and they've been making money on the online schooling trend. The demand for enterprise PCs has gone up. More or less every product that Micron Technology sells has boomed as a result of corona virus and they were able to achieve an Earnings Per Share growth of +77.55% since last year. They also will likely be used for the AI for self-driving cars so that's going to be exciting. We might even see a huge boom from them in the mid term once they start making deals with large EV manufactures. 

Not only have they seen growth in these new product lines but they've also come up with a new chip that should put them ahead of the competition for at [least a few years](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/11/micron-technology-just-announced-an-important-tech/):

&gt;*176-layer NAND flash:*  
&gt;  
&gt;In the press release, Micron announced that it had begun volume shipments of the world's first 176-layer NAND flash chips. For those unfamiliar with NAND flash technology, it's becoming the nonvolatile storage medium of choice for many applications.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Nonvolatile storage retains information even when power is turned off. Legacy hard disk technology still has a place in cheap bulk storage in cloud data centers. Yet cost reductions have made NAND closer to hard disk drives in terms of cost-per-bit, and with much better performance and resilience, less space, and better total cost of ownership in many cases. NAND flash is found in data center servers, smartphones, game consoles, and laptops these days.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;With the data revolution taking off, NAND flash demand is supposed to compound at a 30% annual growth rate. Yet many NAND manufacturers have had a hard time making profits in recent years despite that insatiable end demand. Companies have begun stacking NAND modules on top of each other in a 3D vertical structure, with each layer significantly boosting storage capacity. While demand for bits has gone up, the NAND flash producers have oversupplied the market, crashing NAND prices along with profits.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;However, Micron's innovation could give it a significant leg up on rivals next year.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Why Micron Technology will grow after Covid**:

The big thing to realize is that Micron technologies has [some of the best chips in the market for handling the type of processing power that cell phones need](https://www.micron.com/insight/5g-ai-and-the-coming-mobile-revolution) for [5G and AI](https://www.micron.com/insight/5g-ai-and-the-coming-mobile-revolution). These guys are going to be miles ahead when 5G becomes the norm and the other companies will be trying to catch up for years. Don't take my word for it, trust everyone's favorite holocaust profiteers and Jeffery epstein's favorite bank, Deusche bank, who recently upgraded their outlook on them:

&gt; In a research report, Ho said that Micron is expected to be a solid recovery pick as the economy starts recovering from the global pandemic. Demand drivers such as data centers, 5G smartphones, and gaming will accelerate the growth of Micron. Ho also pointed out that Micron is well-positioned for CY21 (calendar year 2021).   
&gt;  
&gt;Micron Technology is known as being a leading supplier and manufacturer of memory and storage used in a wide range of electronic devices ranging from PCs to smartphones. And the company is currently number three in market share for memory/storage shipments after Samsung and SK Hynix. DRAM currently makes up about two-thirds of the companys total revenue with NAND making up most of the rest of the revenue.  
&gt;  
&gt;DRAM is known for providing high-speed data storage and retrieval. And NAND flash products are electrically rewritable and nonvolatile memory that retains data when power is turned off. This makes NAND ideal for mass-storage uses  specifically for solid-state drives, which have started to displace traditional hard disk drives.  
&gt;  
&gt;DRAM and NAND are both promising for the future as SSDs are expected to be used in the majority of PCs and data centers as well as higher memory and storage content in smartphones. And AI and autonomous vehicles will also require substantial DRAM and NAND capacities.  
&gt;  
&gt;Deutsche Bank is not the only brokerage to increase its price target on Micron. Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh recently increased the price target from $56 to $70. And Morningstar equity analyst Abhinav Davuluri, CFA recently increased the target price to $50 per share from $48. And in an analyst rating consensus of Micron stock with 33 ratings, 76% say buy, 21% say hold, and 3% say sell.

They aren't the only institution that's upgrading their outlook. It'd take too long to go over all of the upgrades so I'm just going to link them:

Theres probably more that I'm missing but you dont need me to post every [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com)/Seeking Alpha/Motley Small Bus Rider word vomit from 2 bit prop traders and amatuer hedge fund larpers to prove my point. This bad boi is going up bigly.

**The most important bit: How to trade**:

You guys can try making money with out of the money two week calls but I suspect that there are other ways to make money on this that might be more lucrative.

First of all shares. Yes they are boring but keep in mind there's a really, really good chance that Micron gets the Vale treatment in the near future and spikes on rumors of being able to supply one of the big EVs with chips. I'm not going to tell you when this might happen because no one knows. But I feel it in my heart of hearts and half of the analysts upgrading it mention how Micron's new chip is going to have massive applications with self-driving automobile technology and if you watched some of the interviews with the Swag Master he always brings it up. Sure it might not be TSLA since they are in bed with TSM but keep in mind if they choose to keep that deal proprietary and TSM doesn't sell that chip to anyone else that means that basically there are no other chips for EV companies to choose from other than Micron.

Second what I'd really recommend are Leaps. Buy yourself some 2022 out of the money calls and you will print money in due time. There are just so many upside potentials with Micron that if even one of them ends up working out then these leaps will print.

TLDR: Buy the 85$ January 2022 MU calls. You'll thank me later.

Title: XOM Calls and Print Money
Buy XOM calls for 2022 and 2023. 

I could go into the DD for why we will see shale declines and how oil majors are slashing budgets right before the economy turns on, but that would take a ton of time.

I bough XOM 2023 $55 calls for 1.85 the day of their earnings and have been buying more ever since. They trade around $4 right now. They will be trading at $30 by next August. 

Im not going to sell you autist on speculative retard plays, as there are plenty of those (PLTR, GME, etc). This one is legit with real companies involved that generate hundreds of billions in revenue.

Buy calls in XOM or RDSA and you will make 5-10x on your money by next summer. Minimum.

Title: Monthly Pump!!!! Whos with me?!?!
Big Idea:

Each month I put together a post asking which stocks do we like this week.

Everyone comments the stock they like the most, and the one with the most upvotes gets pumped to the moon!

Might be illegal, but were autistic so we can claim insanity right?! I feel like we have the power, so lets organize ourselves and use that power!

Title: Airbnb IPO on Wednesday
*#Clown Market DD:*# Buckle up buckaroos I'm gonna show you how to wine and dine on tendies at Wendys this very Wednesday. Neither Bull, nor Bear, I am full-on Clown and this is my native market. Given the recent Clownish trends, which unequivocally guarantee future results (*cf.* "New Paradigm" inflection point of [Figure A](https://transportgeography.org/?page_id=9035), the contents of Airbnb's S-1 disclosure statement (available [here](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-306257/)) and other SEC filings (available [here](https://sec.report/CIK/0001559720)) are completely irrelevant, like seatbelts on a seadoo. 

**TLDR;** Imagine an amount of money you are willing to lose and then double it. Buy ABNB at Fidelity on IPO day, shares on Wednesday afternoon, and calls the following week.

Now before you parade down the street blasting your kazoo, let's go over WHY to buy. UBER IPO'd last year at $41. This was a typical case of insider investors realizing their shares of a shitty, unprofitable company were better off in the hands of retail mothershmuckers. UBER has become even less profitable in the interim, so naturally the stock price has risen to $54. Now some of you bigbrains might be furrowing your fiveheads--ABNB has a clear path to profitability and has indeed [turned a profit](https://www.cnet.com/news/airbnb-first-profit-home-rental-travel-startups/) on multiple occasions. My elf ears hear you ask:

&gt;"Under Clownmarket rules doesn't this mean ABNB will trade flat like a boomer bond?" 

"Nein!" is my reply. Fear not, for ABNB posted a [$322m loss](https://www.vox.com/2020/2/12/21134477/airbnb-loss-profit-ipo-safety-tech-marketing) last year. Although it's not as sexy as [TSLA's $862m loss](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272130/net-loss-of-tesla/) in the same year, we can hope ABNB's costs of expanding into China will swell like an ass-eater's lymph nodes. The analysts certainly think so. Cordwell has a price target of [$75 a share](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ABNB/price-target/) following the likely $45-$50 IPO target.

Although Airbnb is clearly just Uber for your mattress, some skeptics demand more metrics. Compare Booking.com (BKNG) which IPO'd at $483.99 in 1999 and dropped to $7.88 by 2001. Could this happen to ABNB? Absolutely not. Why? Because I got bedbugs once at a booking.com dive with fake pics, and I didn't even call their customer service to get my eleven dollars back. Contrast that with when I got kicked out of an Airbnb in Bali six years ago, I got on the phone with a **specialist** who **investigated** my **case** and gave me a bunch of store credit for shit I didn't even ask for. Add in the fact that BKNG now trades at $2125 and you've got yourself a real *fuck it why not* scenario.  

And finally, *Google Trends* [shows "airbnb" is half as hype as "tesla"](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=airbnb,tesla) which logically puts ABNB at 50% of TSLA's $558b valuation, =$279b, which would put ABNB's share price at $465.

Put the kazoos away boys, this 10-bagger calls for a fanfaronade of vuvuzelas!

Title: Himax $HIMX is undervalued. Investor since 2011
Fabless company... No factories kinda of the middle men with patents that connect the producer and the customer. 2017 they have factories now because of what they did on 3D sensing.

Positives: it's making money in many areas all at once again. 8K TVs, chips in phones and laptops. The normal shits. The growing areas are automotives and 3D sensing for autobots  
decepticon type shit. Lmao. Security for homes, privacy protection and so forth.

They make chips so no need to raise money through stock offerings. In the future they will reinstate their dividend per year.

Negatives: Himax threw too much shit at 3D sensing for phones in 2017. Even threw $80 million+ to make a factory because unable to supply chips. It was in Apple iphoneX until    
Apple the gf left himax for some other dudes with bigger things.

Himax was in Google glass until that failed to gain traction.

Google has 6% of some stock in one of Himax subsidiaries from what seems like a century ago.

Short story: Himax made tons of dumb bets but now they are working on areas like security, privacy and automation for vehicles and big ass HD TVs that will grow every year along with their core businesses.

Analyst have it at $11 target. I would see $11 as cheap. Market cap of about $2 billion if it's at $11

Current price $6.80 it doubled recently.... From $3.

Advice: Buy stonks below $11, buy calls, sell puts and sell calls. 2020 when everything seems to be overvalued. This is a nice gem to hold.

Target above $21... Wake me up when it happens.

I'm not a financial advisor so do not listen to me. But also you should fucking listen to me. If you make money like this post. If you lose money. Fuck me. I'll tattoo wallstreetbets on my ass if it doesn't get to $21 with the next decade.

Title: Possible Short Squezze: VARTA
Varta produces the batteries for Airpods and other wireless headphones (Samsung for example)
They are heavily shorted, 6 Millions shares plus (35,35% of tradeable shares, as 58% of Varta is owned by the Swiss company Montana Tech)
The whole premise of the short sellers is that asian competition will catch up and destroy Varta with cheaper prices, because some non Varta batteries where found in wireless headphones. They were used because Varta couldn't fulfill the demand (meanwhile production increased). This happened in January 2020, since then Varta crashed but already recovered to where it was at the start of the year. But as it seems no big competition entered the market, as forecasts where already raised 2 times this year and sales grew by 70% YoY. Next Years PE is expected to be 25. Short interest is above 40% so short sellers will be hesitant to add to their positions.

With all those factors the price could explode, maybe when they report their next earnings in February and short sellers decide to exit. Christmas sales should boost their sales too.

Title: AVTR
Avantor will be supplying raw materials for all Covid-19 vaccines and has a hand in distributing all over the world. Load up on feb/may calls while they are cheap and you might just make enough to take your wife and her boyfriend to a nice dinner.

Title: PLTR is old news. The best stock to pick up is VERI better (Rockets Included )
Veritine recently sold underwritten shares. The stock is still climbing.

PLTR has a market cap right now of about 48 Billion and declining. VERI is currently sitting at 700 million. VERI has recently signed deals with: The US government, ESPN, NVIDIA, etc. 

VERI is in on technology for the podcast and audio market.

VERI is currently working on advanced battery technology. 

VERI and PLTR a lot of the same business BUT Veritone is branching out into many different areas of the market, and SUCCEEDING. 

TL;DR: VERI is capturing the market where Palantir is already trading at a price and volume that reflect that company pretty well. 

VERI $40 EOY 
 

Positions:
Long VERI 5000 Shares

Highly recommend leaps if you want to be risky. This train isnt over yet.

From people who breathe steel fumes for highs: 

  
"The result: Sources said it is probably only a matter of time before prices hit $45 per cwt, and several said $50 per cwt is a possibility within the next month.

US HRC prices have not been at $50 per cwt since September 4, 2008, according to Fastmarkets records. Thats more than 12 years ago and shortly before the September 15, 2008, collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers triggered a financial crisis.

**Quote of the day**  
Its no longer trying to get an extra buck or two at a time. They are going to be asking for a heck of a lot of money, one Gulf Coast steel consumer said. When spot availability is this tight, the few pounds that they have to sell, they are going to get a really **beefy premium** for it.

Just in case you retards can't read this, I will translate: STEEL MOONS.

The cherry on top is that bushelling prices are getting squeezed which benefits X. Bushelling is a scrap metal and the main ingredient for mini-mills to make steel; X's blast furnace shoots more coke and iron ores. If the competitors are setting prices, and their cost is increasing, X basically free-rides on the price increase while their cost structure is less impacted. 

If X runs into 2007-2008 valuation, by my crystal fucking ball, share price shoots to $60/share. If the steel prices suck some tits and calm down, we can get into 2018's levels, with &gt;$30/share.  
Every week I pound the table (and your gf) to buy United States Steel (NYSE: X), and every week you fuckers just label this as a boomer stock and fuck yourself over on free gains. Don't you get it, the SQUEEZE IS ALREADY HAPPENING. 

Next week, when vaccine rolls out or stimulus bill is passed, X will continue its ascent to the stratosphere. Do you want to miss out on that rocket ship? 

Positions: 32-35K (it keeps going up, I lost track)  X calls from JAN to APRIL.

Title: XXII (plant bio-tech focused on tobacco &amp; cannabis) DD round 1.5
 

First DD found in link below - This stock is up over 100% since I posted this \~1 month ago. Please read the first post before continuing, unless you are familiar with this stock and all of the current news.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j9qv7o/xxii\_plant\_biotech\_company\_working\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j9qv7o/xxii_plant_biotech_company_working_with/)

Onto new updates -

The Atlantic posted this article this morning - [https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/12/easy-way-to-quit-smoking/617305/](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/12/easy-way-to-quit-smoking/617305/)

This article does not call out xxii by name, but outlines that reducing nicotine content in cigarettes will save millions of lives in the US alone by 2100. It should lead to 5 millions smokers quitting within a year. It also prevents new generations from developing the nicotine addiction through cigarettes. XXII is the only company with the science to do this. Putting in place a nicotine mandate would require all of the tobacco companies to work with xxii to produce their own tobacco with very low nicotine. This would tremendously increase value to xxii stock. I am expecting xxii to call attention to this article. Wouldn't be surprised to see a nice green day on monday.

CEO Jim Mish made a presentation at a fall investors summit. Here he talked about how he feels this stock is one of the most undervalued stocks on the market, and talked about how MRTP approval has potential to multiply market cap by 10x or greater. 'woefully undervalued'. MRTP approval is inevitable could come any day now. He describes the nicotine mandate mentioned in the Atlantic article above as a 'grand slam' for xxii, and the MRTP approval a 'home run'.

Here is a link to the PDF of the presentation- [https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\_fe5f861ad8948b35cfe27b4182b3b179/xxiicentury/db/264/2208/presentation/22nd+Century+Fall+Virtual+Investor+Summit+Final+3+PM.pdf](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_fe5f861ad8948b35cfe27b4182b3b179/xxiicentury/db/264/2208/presentation/22nd+Century+Fall+Virtual+Investor+Summit+Final+3+PM.pdf)

And a link to the webcast - [https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2038/38897](https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2038/38897)

A few days after the above presentation, he purchased 100k shares of xxii at $.93. This caused a big increase in share price.

CEO Jim Mish also presented at the Cowen Cannabis Conference (virtual). This was to talk about both the tobacco and cannabis sides of the business. The tobacco side there wasn't too much of an update, just giving another audience the perspective of the company. On the cannabis side, he did say they have collected quite a variety of IP for cannabis, particularly for THC and other isolated/combined cannabinoids, and he said they want to start monetizing what they have in 2021.

Link to the video presentation in this tweet - [https://twitter.com/\_xxiicentury/status/1334232944634945542](https://twitter.com/_xxiicentury/status/1334232944634945542)

Their main focus has been nicotine and tobacco, but as of late their cannabis side has been pushing along. They have retail investments on the Panacea side and genomic/IP investments on their own and with KeyGene.

In addition to all of this which, on it's own is extremely exciting, they have a third plant-based venture to announce, noting that this third plant has many genomic similarities to the cannabis plant and also that the three plants (tobacco, cannabis, TBD..) are synergetic. This leads me to believe the third plant line has to do with hops. Just a guess.

Mish has been hyper focused on the mission of getting MRTP approved, pushing to get the cannabis side of the business making money, and getting investors on board. He has been setting up near bi-weekly conference calls like the LD micro 500. Just spreading the word and letting people know we are primed to go as soon as the FDA gives us the OK to market properly.

Thanks for reading and let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Title: AMC takeover Thesis 
All cash bid from Disney @ $4.00 Share (must happen before dilution)

Headline: Disney buys over 600 well placed and run locations to continue building the overall brand and dominance

Movie production to end user with NO middle party. Unlocking margin and increasing spend on more production! 

Advertising at-will within their owned locations! Ability to own the spaces overall programming and ad machine!

Disney branded stores can be included in lobbies of cinemas! 

Theme park advertising essentially free!

Use of retired prop equipment can be sent to theaters for use. 

A future theatre empire based solely on being the Disney brand will spark the future of integrated media and entertainment. 

Take 10 dollars off the current Disney share price and add 40 back after Disney shows the public what having a great movie experience is.  

Hope I at least get a discount for free popcorn after marrying these two.

Title: CRSP on the move
I posted this in the weekend discussion, but I think it should go here and get buried under all the garbage. 

CRSP has been on a roll the last few days. In the last 20 days theyve gone from a low of $93.99 to closing Friday at $147.54 and getting an ATH earlier Friday of $151.11. I fucking love this company, I will hold my shares forever, I just wished there was more options volume.....

WELL GUESS WHAT. CRSP just participated in an investor conference. Since they did that, the price has been climbing. I just saw an article for a medical journal - RELEASED TODAY! talking about the breakthrough theyve had treating a patient with sickle cell disease and another who required regular blood transfusions. Both effectively cured. This news just came out to the public today. I checked the options and CRSP 1/15 $160 has the volume and OI (1584) needed for a play. Sizzle index (if you pay any attention to that) is 2.02 calls to 0.68 puts. I dont ever remember seeing it that high before. Now that this news is out to the public, I predict the price will continue on its current trajectory.

Something to check out thats out of the ordinary: Friday at 12:33, look at the size of that volume. 

Link to the post with medical journal: https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/k7g985/crisprcas9_gene_editing_successful_for_a_patient/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

TLDR: CRSP 1/15 $160c Monday morning.

Title: Hewlett-Packard Enterprises (HPE) announced its moving HQ from Silicon Valley, CA to Houston, TX
HPE is also planning on reducing its footprint in California by consolidating all of its Bay Area sites to San Jose. The move is expected to save the company tens of millions of dollars. 

CEO Antonio Neri also announced that sales had returned to "pre-COVID levels" signalling a strong financial outlook moving into 2021. Here are he companys third quarter results:

    Net Sales: $7.2 billion vs. $6.88 billion

    Diluted EPS: 37 cents vs. $34 cents

Neri struck a bullish tone of HPEs top line momentum continuing into 2021. HPE Stock closed Friday at 12.34 (+6.29%).

Time to strike?

Title: GME 4Q Bottom Up E-Commerce &amp; Financial Model
So, about a month ago I made the observation that GME's U.S. website processes its order numbers in sequential order.

Given that, I have constructed a model that uses the quarter-to-date e-commerce order data, credit card data scrapes from two separate vendors (&amp; sticking my fucking finger in the air), as well as that bullshit finance stuff that nerds use to come up with a 4Q estimate since the sell-side analysts are such shit-head haters and probably work for Melvin Capital (fuck 'em).

IDGAF is this is gibberish to you, but it tells me and the other autists that the analysts are fucking wrong and 4Q is going to crush Wall Street's estimates. Yes, 4Q20 which comes in March, not 3Q20 which comes on Tuesday.

Feedback appreciated.

Title: $TU  An opportunity to print free tendies
Based on the title of this post, you must be asking to yourself that "What the hell is TU?" never heard about it.Oh boy, you're missing out on lovely tendies if you haven't heard about the ** TU.**

&amp;#x200B;

***Description***

Telus Communications is a company that provides services such as internet access, voice, entertainment, healthcare, video etc. It's basically a huge ass Canadian company headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia with a market cap of **25B$.**

&amp;#x200B;

***Why is this a solid play?***

The stock is currently trading at **$19.91** with low IV. The stock needs to go up by only **9 cents** in next 2 weeks for you to print tendies. **$20.00** Strike is going for only **0.18** cents each. If the stock goes to **20.3$** by December 18 then you print around **66%.** Not bad, huh? I have posted a chart from option profit calculator incase you wanna see how much tendies you'll print on the potential target price.

The IV is also extremely low so the probability of you getting IV crushed are 0 to none as long as it keeps going up.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***Recent Trend***

TU has been growing slow and steadily for the past month and could potentially cross 20.2$ by EOW. It grew by around **2.7%** in the last month. Don't believe me? Look at the 1 month trend below.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***Financials***

If you look at their income statement, they have a good revenue stream and were not much affected by Covid. Infact, they added more customers in quarter 3. Their numbers show that they're also financially healthy and have a good profitability margin. This isn't a company to go down overnight or a company that swings a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

[Source : MorningStar](https://preview.redd.it/djruah9hfg361.png?width=1261&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c46def6c7e5dd0a1953294ce54300443a4846e49)

&amp;#x200B;

***Analyst comments***

This is what equity analyst **"Matthew Dolgin, CFA"** of MorningStar says about the company :"Telus handily beat FactSet consensus revenue estimates while falling short on the profit lines in what was nonetheless an outstanding third quarter. Results exceeded our expectations throughout wireless and wireline as the firm once again led the industry across most key metrics. Despite the pandemic, customer additions equaled or exceeded last years third-quarter result in every category. Our long-term outlook and CAD 29 fair value estimate are unchanged, and we think this best-of-breed company is undervalued."Here's the link to the Equity Report if you wanna read the entire thing  - [MorningStar Link](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/tu/analysis)

&amp;#x200B;

***Now you must be thinking, oh he def trynna pump this shit. Why did stonk not go up if the Q3 earnings were good?***

Well one of the reasons could be their **EBITDA. $TU's** ebitda was quite a lot down from the same period last year (Q3,2019) and it didn't improve from their previous quarterly results. On the other hand, their competitors had better adjusted **EBITDA** and had improved from previous quarters.

&amp;#x200B;

***Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG)***As you all know Canadians are known for their kindness and public likes this company for what they have done during pandemic. Telus contributed around $150 million for the covid relief and expanded their programs to help citizens. They also started two business units only focused towards the positive economic and social outcomes for the Canadians.

&amp;#x200B;

***Institutional Buyers***

Many institutional buyers have increased their holdings after Q3 in TU. There are around 497 institutional owners holding approx 58% of the shares of this company.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***Risks***

TU uses Huawei equipments for their 3G and 4G networks and if the Canadian government considers to put a regulatory restriction and banning Huawei equipments then the stock price could plummet but there have been no recent news about it and its highly unexpected from Canadian government. With the Canadian wireless network being a lot less penetrated than United States &amp; Europe, this stock is most likely to go up in the near future.

&amp;#x200B;

***P.S - This is not a financial advice and I am not responsible for your trades. Do your own DD before investment. bla bla bla..***

&amp;#x200B;

***TLDR : 20$ Calls, 12/18 Expiry. Current stock price 19.91$, contract price 18$ per contract.***

**My position : 40 contracts expiring 12/18, 20c's**

Title: If PornHub IPOs expect FAANG level valuation.
The meme stock of all meme stocks. A company of the people. You idiots cannot tell me that retail investors wont pump the ticket PORN to the moon.

Title: Get in on BB (Big Bagger) before people wake up and start valuing it properly
Okay, BB actually stands for BlackBerry. Now, if you're an unwoke retard, which you probably are, the first thing you think of is "They're still alive?" / "they still sell phones?" / "hurr durr what is this 2010?" Don't worry, you're not alone, as this assumption doesn't elude even the best boomer trader of them all, Jim Cramer, who just 2 days ago told people to "sell Blackberry and buy Apple" after the Amzon announcement (to be covered in a bit). Newsflash -- they don't even compete in the same market anymore, boomer!! They haven't been competing in the same market since 2013, as they quietly pivot from hardware to software. 

In short, Blackberry is now a software company, who has a powerful operating system, QNX, which is used in Audi, BMW, Jaguar, Land Rover, and Toyota cars. BlackBerry just partnered with Amazon to develop BlackBerry IVY, which collects a multitude of vehicle data from all these manufacturers. Yes, it is true that Tesla has a HUGE advantage over any other single (keyword: single) automobile manufacturer when it comes to driving and road data, but what happens when you consolidate EVERYONE ELSE who is frothing to beat Tesla for vehicle and road data? BB's data (scaling with AWS) will absolutely catch up and crush TSLA's.

Hold on it gets better. BB ALSO does cybersecurity with US FedRAMP certifications, which allows the US government to use their end to end solution for secure communications. They also own AtHoc, which has been crushing it for COVID crisis communications for universities, hospitals, and Fortune 500 companies, including a partnership with ServiceNow for incident management tracking, and in Microsoft Teams for enterprise communications. For a cybersecurity comparison, Crowdstrike (CRWD) trades at a price-to-sales ratio of roughly 40x, Palo Alto Networks at about \~8x. BB "only" make 800-1b annually and growing, (about what Palantir makes), and is **only** trading at 3.3x sales. If someone can give me DD on why CRWD will eat BB's lunch, I will eat my socks if BB doesn't eventually float up closer to these valuations.

 If this company were rebranded RaspBerry and fresh IPOing today you bet your ass it would instantly be a 30 to 50bill market cap company. Factor in "car data", "government security contracts" hype add another 10billion. I almost don't want to post this DD as I'm not done accumulating shares yet, but will definitely be buying on any pullback. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: BlackBerry 1/15 9c, eyeing the 3/19 10c. AMD flashbacks to when they were only worth 4billion.  
Lastly, SpaceX (Falcon) uses QNX OS. Where do these  go? SPACE. BB literally will blast off to outer space.

Title: AMZN: biggest covid-19 winner is undervalued
Almost all of amazons revenue streams grew a lot caused by covid. Nevertheless the stock is consolidating since a while.

At the same time other covid stocks skyrocketed! I think one of the reasons AMZN didn't move yet, is the high stock price, so most Robinhood investors couldn't participate.

Also the chart looks very good from a TA perspective. Long pennant on the daily &amp; weekly chart.

Cramer called it.

This is ready for a huge breakout!
Personally I think it will happen in the next two weeks, so 18 Dec Calls could also work.

TLDR: 
AMZN 15Jan 3300 Call 
Or any other affordable call

Title: $PSTH - 100% Not PornHub
Well PSTH crew, Bill has finally came out and openly called for regulation of the PornHub business in a spread of four tweets this morning.  He is demanding that PornHub have monitors for all media on the site and ID verification for age to all actors performing all...scenes (makes me laugh thinking about a chick taking two dicks in the butt as a scene).

[Bills 12/5/20 Tweetd](https://twitter.com/billackman/status/1335244145699528704?s=21)

This goes against the PornHub model...also is demanding the business to take on much more labor than its current cash burn rate.  It really makes you wonder how quickly rumors make it up the chain to senior management.

Outside of just the sheer amount of labor involved with trying to legitimize these businesses (does not fit the Q1 2021 timeline to get these guys above the board) there is no possible way that Bill, Baupost, Guggenheim, the Ontario teachers union would be seeded to heavy in the SPAC just for it to come out as PornHub and hounded for supporting a business who profits off of the exploitation of Minors and Rape.

So currently Stripe is still on the Table with the moves to Hire SEC compliance auditors and a Head of investor relations - the Brothers have just recently said no an IPO. They are clearly gearing up for a move towards the public markets leaving a DPO or SPAC reverse merger on the table.

Or we could be holding massive bags of Inspire Brands since it fits into his last play with BurgerKing then merging to created $QSR. Inspire...Arbys (We have the meats), Chads favorite BWW and some tacos that only people with two first names know about.

I dont think its going to be the meats...but just in case Ill drop a 10 min looped video of the Slogan so you can hype yourself up.


LOTS of Shares @ $23.15avg

Title: Hyliion Part 2
 I had to type out the Special Purpose Acquisition Companies by name because gay mods auto delete posts including spac tickers.

Congratulations if you saw my last post about Stable Road Acquisition since you are up about 60% in a few weeks. However, this one is even better. My PT is 25. Why? I got in Hyliion at $20 when it was still a spac and sold at around $50. It is now sitting at $18, so how did I have a gut feeling this was going to moon? I compared it to it's competitor, Nikola, that recently deSPAC'd and mooned to an extraordinary valuation for vaporware. Hyliion, on the other hand, had vehicles on the road and had a more realistic idea on how to transform the trucking industry. Well, Hyliion part 2 is happening right now, except it's just getting started. Northern Genesis Acquisition is the new Hyliion, and CIIG Merger is the new Nikola. CIIG Merger, merging with Arrival, is an EV bus and delivery truck maker. While their vehicles look nice, they are nothing but vaporware right now and aren't expecting revenue until 2022, if all goes perfectly. Also, they are promising to build "Microfactories" that will be a self-proclaimed game changer to how commercial vehicles are made. Sounds pretty memeable and it is, which is why its currently valued at 16.6 billion. Buying now would be very high risk, low reward. However, it's less known counterpart Northern Genesis Acquisition  is very low risk, high reward. Northern Genesis Acquisition  is valued right now at 2.43 bil. That's a massive difference. I'd argue that Northern Genesis Acquisition  is only valued this low because it's still very much unknown, just like Hyliion was at 13-14. While CIIG Merger is mooning based on vaporware, let's discuss what Northern Genesis Acquisition  has that makes it an attractive investment and why they are more realistic on their goals:

* [300 buses currently on the road that have driven a total of 6 million miles.](https://imgur.com/a/ImGqyg8)

This is one of the best EV SPAC opportunities yet based on valuation and with everything that they are doing. This is many SPACs in one (R M G Acquisition,  Switchback Energy Acquisition, CIIG Merger, etc) come to mind, and you can see how well those spacs are doing. CIIG Merger is going to Nikola fuck you levels of valuation for nothing but vaporware while a lesser known company with more realistic expectations and a better long term hold Northern Genesis Acquisition  is just getting started. The $25 PT I have for Northern Genesis Acquisition would mean it is trading at a mere 2.65x 2023E revenue (CIIG Merger is currently trading at 3.25x 2023E revenue, which I think their revenue projection is insane like Fisker, but I digress). Northern Genesis Acquisition has a much easier rode of hitting their goals.

Also, I'm not saying CIIG Merger is another Nikola as in a fraudulent company. I just think they are overhyped at their current stage.

TLDR - Buy commons of Northern Genesis Acquisition and watch it go to $25+. Northern Genesis Acquisition is the new HYLN while CIIG Merger is the new Nikola. If you compare Northern Genesis Acquisition to CIIG Merger you get $25+ PT.

Disclaimer: All in 100% with 6130 commons at $13.90 avg.

Title: NNOX - radiologist's DD
I've been lurking here for years for the hilarious memes. It's time for me to actually contribute something.

I've been a radiologist for years. I watched NNOX's RSNA (Disneyland for radiology) presentation. I attended RSNA virtually for professional reasons of course. I'm going to keep this as short and simple as possible. 

Background on NNOX and x-rays

NNOX proposes a room-temp, ?cheaper electron gun to make x-rays, as opposed to the currently used hot electron gun. Keep in mind x-rays have a lot more parts than just the electron gun (target, bucky, brightness control). X-rays are used in radiographs (2D picture), tomosynthesis (fancy x-ray that allows you to determine depth, requires 180degrees view), and CT scans (requires 360degrees view). 

What did NNOX present?

A human hand radiograph and dummy tomosynthesis using their gun. Nothing I saw was technologically shocking. In fact, I read hundreds of radiographs and dozens of tomo images this week. Side note, him comparing his hand x-ray next to Dr. Rotengen's first medical x-ray from &gt;100years ago was a little tachy, like putting your selfie next to a portrait of jesus. 

Sentiment

Very few people have heard of them in the professional imaging community. I can't find any scientific papers about their tech. Kinda sus...

Regulatory

I'm sure they'll get their 510(k) approved. That's a really low bar. 

My thoughts on their proposal

Pay-per-scan x-ray, AI/cloud/network/\*insert tech buzzword here\*-based interpretation. Major healthcare systems just would not go for that. EVen assuming their tech is both cost-effective and non-inferior, their proposal disrupts (not in a good way) too many things simultaneously (radiologists' and technologists' workflow, reimbursement, existing vendors etc.). Don't get too excited about AI in radiology btw. It's underwhelming at best. 

I'm sure they have valid use cases though - such as rural areas, developing countries (if you're investing, think about the TAM here). I believe their team isn't out to scam people, like NKLA or Theranos. I just wish they would open their technology to peer review and quash any doubts. 

My positions

No position in NNOX. I don't feel like backing or shorting them. Unless something changes, I'll just watch from the sidelines. 

If I turn out to be horribly wrong, feel free to rub it in. 

Long TDOC and butterfly. 

I'm working today and tomorrow, so don't expect any prompt replies.

Title: Hooker  Furniture

So I was browsing the hood in the upcoming earnings to find my next FD play and I saw this gold mine.

Hookers that make and sell furniture? My god, the business model itself is genius. Then I look at the ytd? Up 38%. Thats like 900%+ my earnings ytd.

Think about it. 
Hookers.
Hard wood.

When has that combination not turned out great?

Im riding this hooker to the moon   

Im expecting the earnings to come in at like .69 cents at least. And the best part? These contracts are only 1 cent! Lmao I dont even know any hookers that cheap.

Title: Docebo $DCBO is Flying Under the Radar. DD Inside.
# The concept:

With Docebo Learn (LMS), enterprises have the ability to centralize and organize courses, distribute and manage online and instructor-led courses, track certifications and measure results with dashboards and custom analytics. Docebo Learn (LMS) is powered by AI, automatically tagging learning content and making it easier to find.

Docebo also provides accompanying modules to Docebo Learn include Docebo Coach &amp; Share (AI Powered Social Learning)**,** enabling learning in the flow of work with informal and experiential learning opportunities and Docebo Perform (skills gap management), helping organizations empower their people through skills gap analysis and improving employee competencies with targeted learning programs based on the current and future skills need of your business.

&amp;#x200B;

# Customers:

Docebo has over 2,000 business customers, including the following:

**Thomson Reuters, Heineken, DocuSign, OpenTable, Wal-Mart, and** ***Amazon***\*\*.\*\*

They recently secured a contract with Amazon to provide the training and certification for AWS. This is huge for obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

# Financials:

Docebo isn't profitable (duh), but they have massive revenue growth. For Q3, their revenue grew 60% YoY, with over 10% quarterly revenue growth.

Stock is currently valued at $1.46B. Considering their growth, recently securing their largest contract, and potential upside at less than $1.5B, I think there is massive potential here.

# 

# Everything else:

Docebo IPO'd literally two days ago, so you still have time to get in \*early\*. Wouldn't that be nice? Getting into a stock \*before\* the 200% run up? Obviously there's more risk but you know for sure you aren't buying the top of a pump.

With WFH being a more permanent change in corporate culture, Docebo will be at the forefront of a changing trend and will continue to be in significant demand.

Could potentially expand into University and K-12 education in the future as another avenue for growth. With online and hybrid education becoming bigger, tools like Docebo will be extremely useful.

Retard factor: It's an SaaS cloud computing AI company. How many of these that recently IPO'd haven't gone up 1000 fucking percent?

Title: Lion will win DD
Alright you sexy autistic retards I'm here to bring forth a legend from the northern french alcoholic plains of Quebec. There is a company called lion electric and the government are sucking their schlongs like it's st jean Baptiste rebirth. They have deals with Amazon and ABB. And are replacing the buses in Quebec. They are expanding quickly. It's another fucking spac as well ticker NGA . Pretty sure it stands for not going to eat ass. They forgot the E but it's okay they're french retards.

I don't have calls in them only shares for now. But as you can see from they chart is that they passed the previous ath resistance level and that means this Samuel Jackson of a ride sing over yet.

Title: MUFG DD
TL;DR: MUFG's price is way under the actual value of the stock. The MUFG $5 2/19/21 Call option at .10 is beyond undervalued.

Yesterday, I posted my [gains chart for the past month](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6u2m2/thank_you_all_for_changing_my_life/) where I've consistently been moving up to what amounted to a +780.93% return on investments. I did this through personal research into stocks, statistics, value ratios, and game theory. I've listened to what successful people were doing on this sub and modified it for my own personal strategy.

People have been asking what my positions were so I've decided to start doing write ups. I'm currently invested in 12 companies, most which have already made me profits. My strategy is simple, find companies that are very undervalued and compare the risk to reward ratios for the various call options.

Today, I want to tell you about MUFG. 


**Value Ratios**


Earning per share - .24

Price per Book - .36

Projected Earning Growth - .83

Annual Dividend is at 5.29%

These numbers by themselves tell me that the current price of MUFG is way below what the actual value of the stocks are. These value ratios mean that the stock price is heavily incentivized to go up.

This company has already hit two major floors, one being the major sell-off since it's high at just over $8 down to a floor of around $5, and a floor of $3.43 after the Coronavirus sell-off. I'm not worried about this stock crashing anymore because it has already crashed as hard as it can. It is currently making it's recovery.

In January, Biden will take over as president and I anticipate many policies will be made to get an actual economic recovery underway. I don't believe this has been priced into MUFG's current price yet. 

I understand this is a Japanese company, but we have to understand that the stocks in an American stock market are pushed mainly by American investors. Once more Americans have disposable income, there will be more money thrown into the stock market, and I believe that if the actual value of MUFG doesn't entice investors, it's 5.29% dividend will.

Options for this stock are pretty low volume. I bought 50 shares of MUFG $5 2/19/21 at an average of .12 per share. This is a price I would expect for a weekly expiration, not one in February. In order to profit, the stock needs to hit $5.13 by 2/19.

The floor of this stock before the Pandemic was already at $5 and was making a recovery before Covid struck. I don't see how this stock does not eventually go back up to it's floor of $5, if not surpass that floor and go on to $6 or $7.

Again, at calls prices at .10, I felt that it would be ludicrous to not throw something in and see if I'm right.

After it's first major sell off, MUFG hovered around $5 a share before it started going back up. This was stopped by the Coronavirus outbreak, which caused another sell off to $3.43 in March. Ever since then, this stock has been making a slow, but steady climb up.

The stock has already grown 28% since hitting it's floor in March. It showed recent highs of 4.62 on 11/17 and 11/24. In order for it to hit 5.13, the stock needs to grow just 16.85% more.

Unless something crazy happens, I don't see how this stock doesn't hit at least $5.13 by the time this option expires. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if this stock was around $6 or $6.5 by the time all is said and done.

Once people realize the value of this company, people will buy shares. Once people buy shares, people will realize that the options are valuable. Once people realize that, the price of the option should go up.

For $12 and option, I am giving myself the opportunity to make a huge return on investment if my math and logic are right. If it doesn't hit, I've really not lost that much money.

How did I make 780.93% return on the stock market this past month? These are the types of bets I make. I've had more hits than misses, and the hits easily outweigh the misses.

If you liked this write-up and would like more, I'm happy to present write-ups for some of my other positions. I have call options for TROX (Already up 59.22% with an expiration in 2/19), UNM (bought at .20, up to .53, exp. 3/19), KNOP, LFC, SPTN, GTN, PTVE, AMKR, CS, and TKC. Please fill free to nitpick, ask questions, or shoot my theory down. The more we work together, the better chance we have at actually finding bets that make profits.

Title: Just bumping a reply I made so more you can gain insight from it.
Don't rely on TA alone. The market sentiment was weak this week because of the SaaS sector earnings risks and the desire of hedge funds to get in cheaper for a second December rally. HOHOHO.

Salesforce got hammered to create enough delta for a gap up back to $250+ for accumilation. 

Snowflake couldn't stay down and its valuation is absurd, approxiamtely the size of IBM.

Palantir will retest $30 and breakout, just because SNOW did. ($370s) It's up to 2.5X PLTR market capitalization with half the revenue and an operating loss of 14 million. These SNOW investors paid up early for next year 2022. All the Warren Buffett hype and it's paid for WallStreet IPO client/Brokerage PR bias shilling (even by Cramer who won't support PLTR because of the Direct Listing model as an ex-hedge fund manager)

Facebook's underwriters wereMorgan Stanley,J.P. Morgan,Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Barclays and Allen &amp; Co. - and they fucked Facebook with a botched roadshow and  didn't say anything meaningful to shore up its 16 month share price collapse. 

They were too busy being bearish on FB and probably shorted it themselves, especially Goldman Sachs. 

Peter Thiel is a Director on the Facebook Board and remembers what low value paying $350 million for IPO offers.

Thiel and Karp dumped very cheap shares on the first trading day to provide liquidity and Wall Street was (by law very neutral but with a bearish vibe with chicken little risky risky!!!) 

This company would have been IPO listed at $35 a share, still making it much cheaper than the Snowflake IPO. But you can't withhold Wallstreet its tendie tribute. Thiel took it directly to the exchange. 

Meme stock or not, I'm disappointed to see the lack of faith in this company because of a broad market shakeout. $21 was a great entry point, but people expect to realize their ideal oversold wet dream. The Germans are bullish still calling it the next Tesla fairy-tale story. Karp is phil-German and speaks fluently while studying in Frankfurt for years and considers it his cultural homeland. Thiel is German American. So was Wernher Von Braun...*cough Elon Musk the South African/Canadian of Dutch ancestory. 

You chose your bets.

Title: GHIV TO THE MOON  (DD)

Real estate investor here. If no one buys a home at all in 2021 buying GHIV still works and this is why:

Homeowners rolling over old mortgages into new ones accounted for 62 percent of all lending activity in the second quarter of 2020, up from 54.5 percent of loans in the first quarter of 2020 and from 39.6 percent in the second quarter of 2019.

Even your grandma is getting a refi for 2.5%, and she owned her house outright. Good job grandma.

Metro areas with at least 1 million people that saw refinance activity at least doubled, year over year, in the second quarter of 2020 includedWashington, DC(up 219.9 percent);Milwaukee, WI(up 213.1 percent);Austin, TX(up 211.9 percent);Raleigh, NC(up 205.3 percent) andBirmingham, AL(up 198.4 percent).

United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) underwrites loans for mortgage brokers, banks and credit unions. It doesn't lend directly to borrowers.

They play the middle. They don't hold the loans. They don't employ bankers. They use independent brokers. They are transactional, and there is ALOT of transactions in this current low interest economy.

Homeowners deal with the company's loan servicing department. Founded in 1986, United Wholesale Mortgage is headquartered in Pontiac, Michigan, and is one of the top wholesale lenders in the country.

Ok, cool but what makes them special?

United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM), the #1 wholesale mortgage lender, set a company record of $107.7 billion in mortgage loan volume in 2019, more than doubling its 2018 production of $41.5 billion. In doing so, it broke the wholesale industry record of $103.3 billion of mortgage loan volume previously set in 2005 by Countrywide Financial. UWM also secured the title of #1 wholesale lender for the fifth year in a row which has never been done before in the industry.

These guys are literally the McDonalds of mortgages. Their rates are the lowest, their fees are the lowest, and they are the most competitive all around. Their growth and numbers prove it. 

Now before you wet your pants with excitement. 2021 will see some downturn in the housing market due to foreclosures. This may or may not effect the mortgage industry on paper, but it could drive down sentiment. So if you have the patience, this is a solid play for long term with room for alot of growth.

Either way, if you don't buy the stock, you need to give these fuckers a call. 1.99% on a 30 year fixed if you qualify, and if you would save money by getting the mortgage refi, use that savings to buy the stock, then you don't have to come out of pocket. Your welcome. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

Title: FEAC (DraftKing guys) and why its good for a short-term 30% return.
FEAC is a SPAC being used to send the company Skillz Inc public. A SPAC, In short, is a company that forms for the sole purpose of bringing another company public. The company backing this SPAC is no other than the same which backed Draftkings (Flying Eagle). Flying Eagles CEO is Harry Sloan. He has been in the business a long time. He was a founding investor and board member of a company you might have heard of - Bethesda Games. So either he has a great eye for this or he is super lucky - Time will tell. 

Skillz is an online mobile multiplayer competition platform that helps developers monetize their games. You likely havent heard of most of the games Skillzs represents, but your grandma probably has. They are: Solitaire Cube, Blackout Bingo, Pool Payday, 21 Blitz and more. All of these are listed on the Apple and Android App Store. All highly rated and with thousands of reviews. The thing that makes them unique vs. other games is that you can 100% legally gamble in them. They accept PayPal and most major credit cards. All withdrawals of winnings can go straight to your bank account. How they managed to get this pass both major App Stores and the US gov I cant seem to figure out. 

Noteworthy Facts:
1. Forbes named it on its list of the next Billion dollar start ups. CNBC named Skillz the global leader in eSports. 
2. Skillz players averages 65 min per day. To put in perspective, Netflix only averages 50 min per day, per user. 
3. They expect user growth to get into the hundreds of millions within the next two years. 
4. 10 different SPACS tried to bag Skillz IPO, but they decided to pick Flying Eagle because of Harry Slones success. 
5. Financials: Third Quarter Revenue of $60 Million (Up 92% Year-over-Year), Revenue for Year to Date of $162 Million, (Up 91% Over Prior Year). Full Year Revenue expected at $225 Million. 
6. Working towards being incorporated into Peleton bikes. 

Skillz checks the box on financials. The rest is up to interpretation. The important take aways for me here is that its backed by a guy with a great eye for gaming and a company that has somehow added gambling to these games. I also am seeing little talk about it on stock forms (only 2 posts on WSB in the last 3 months) and the general media for a company that is getting high marks from some major hitters like Forbes and CNBC. Its been on a steady rise since it officially announced its IPO on Monday, so dont expect a 100% return, but its in no way done. 2 rocket ship emojis 

Positions: $50k stock. 
Selling 50% at $20, 25% at $22 and holding 25% long term.

Title: LAZR, more like... loser
Luminar, a company with virtually no sales, recently went public through a reverse merger with GMHI. Thanks to a catchy ticker, they shot up to \~$32 this week. This of course is retarded. As we all know, our lord and savior Elon Musk hates lidar, and I'm betting this fucker is primed to crater harder than Nikola.

Now when GMHI announced the deal, they were valuing Luminar at roughly $3.5 billion dollars, a bat shit crazy number for a company expecting to do $15 million in revenue this year, and $26 million the next. The market quite understandably knew this was a shit deal, and the stock sat pretty much at NAV forever. Yet today, that company pulling in a cool $15 million is "worth" over $10 billion.

Next take a look at Velodyne Lidar, a larger, significantly more established competitor who also briefly topped out at $32 a share, and is now hanging out at just over $15. They were only valued at $1.6 billion in their SPAC deal, and are expecting just over $100 million in revenue this year. 

If you need another reason to buy puts, the paint chip eating wizard of Wallstreet Jim Cramer thinks its a bargain at this price.

Also sorry this is after market close, took me forever to get reasonable fill prices. 

**TLDR; Elon say bad, Cramer say good, 12/18 $25p.**

Title: $SPCE Short Interest (1 WEIRD Trick, Short sellers hate it!)
SPCE Short Interest has peaked a long amount of interest within me. 

47,890,000 shares of SPCE have been sold short.

53,650,000 shares of SPCE are able to be traded (float).

We are sitting at 89% of float sold short as of 15 November. What does this seemingly random number mean an autist like you? 

A price rise to $40 will absolutely penetrate short sellers and they will likely begin to cover the position thus driving prices up. SPCE could see $50 by EOY, just in time for this crazy simulation to be over.

In summary, we know Dick Branson as the man that could sell a cock ring to a tranny. His level of salesmanship is unmatched. He WILL sell more tickets on the damn space ship. 

You know what to do on Monday morning!

Title: Boomer Stonk Dish starts Diving -1.99% today
Opening at $37.22 a high not seen since June. They received a downgrade today at Guggenheim from Buy to neutral.  [Marketwatch - Guggenheim update](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dish-stock-gets-a-downgrade-at-guggenheim-2020-12-04)

Dish closed at $36.44.

"While we had hoped asset value would have been realized through either a sale of spectrum or a partnership with a deep-pocketed tech firm, those scenarios are seemingly becoming much less likely,"  "

Dish only being up 3.8% this year compared to the S&amp;P 500 at 14%. 

They purchased Boost Mobile in July for 1.4 Billion with 9 million customers. They have said they're making progress on moving into the wireless field as a "disruptor" but many are beginning to skepticism. 

Today (Reuters) Dish has agreed to pay $210 million in a telemarketing lawsuit.

[Reuters telemarketing lawsuit](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-dish-network-settlement/dish-network-reaches-210-million-robocall-telemarketing-settlement-idUSKBN28E2UH)

In addition to their blackouts this week and not agreeing to pay a fair market price to Nextar for their channels. Right now many Dish customers are left furious.

" The dispute has taken 164 local Nexstar stations off the air in 115 markets. Nexstar owns stations that are CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox network affiliates. "

[Dish vs Nextar (2 days ago)](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article247574415.html)

Sources inside Dish say many customers have been canceling new connections, switching services, and Dish has been forced to give out free over the air antennas as compensation in some areas. This costs the company the product and an appointment for the technician to install it.

[See product here $89 to consumer](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Televes-Televes-Dinova-BOSS-Antenna/1002745730)  (This is the model Dish uses and is giving away)

&amp;#x200B;

Price began to slip today, I opened some PUTS at the peak. I would hope, and forsee, price slipping to 30 EOY or early January.  They have lost other channels this year as well, with revenue's and earnings taking a hit from customer loss I don't forsee this hitting earnings well.

&gt; At Intel, ourstrategy is to deliver the worlds best semiconductors for an increasingly data-centric world. Over the last few years, weve initiated a transition from being a PC-centric company to a data-centric one and expanded our product offerings in order to seize new market opportunities.

&gt; By focusing on our four strategic priorities  accelerating the growth of the company, improving our execution, thoughtfully deploying our capital and evolving our culture  we can have a larger impact on our customers success.

&gt; 2024 Total Addressable Market: ~$300B

&gt; Based on our analytics, we anticipate a total addressable market (TAM) of nearly $300 billion by the year 2024. In addition to this TAM, we also see opportunities beyond silicon in areas like software and services.

The memes and kiddy investors think Intel is going down so the IV is low and premiums are at a good price. The bears are always wrong about tech stocks. They think intel is some kind of shitty company that doesn't have the worlds leading market movers invested in their success, I dont know maybe I'm wrong about their thoughts. I can't read their minds but I can read Intels press releases and figures.

News like this about AI, maybe it's not gaming performance but that's not what we are here to talk about:

&gt; Intel Announces Unmatched AI and Analytics Platform with New Processor, Memory, Storage and FPGA Solutions

https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-announces-unmatched-ai-analytics-platform-new-processor-memory-storage-fpga/#gs.n7nrs7

&gt; Why Its Important:AI and analytics open new opportunities for customers across a broad range of industries, including finance, healthcare, industrial, telecom and transportation. IDC predicts that by 2021, 75% of commercial enterprise apps will use AI1. And by 2025, IDC estimates that roughly a quarter of all data generated will be created in real time, with various internet of things (IoT) devices creating 95% of that volume growth2.

They have their hands in Machine Learning, AI, neuroscience and self driving cars...

&gt; Spotlight: Big Bets
&gt; To be at the forefront of the constant technological change in our industry, we must evaluate new and existing big bets based on the following criteria: the bet is leading the edge of a technology inflection, it plays a significant role in our customers success, and it offers a clear path to profitability and attractive returns. Our current big bets are memory, autonomous driving, and 5G.

I don't see any reason to logically remain skeptical of Intels consistent year to year performance and market adaptations.

Here are the necessary edits I had to include in the post that are responses to trolls, if anyone wants more info and meme defense: 

Edit because trolls:

Look at the greeks of the contract if you know how to read them. They are good for this strike price. 

It is a safe and profitable bet with the delta and vega ratings. A 10% increase in the underlying would put it past strike price and net several hundred % return on investment. 

I'm sorry if I'm "casting pearls before swine" and this is all going everyone's heads like my [$6 ITM PLTR calls I posted last month.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jh2njz/get_in_on_this_while_you_can_pltr_6_itm_call_you/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) But let's stop playing dumb ok?

Also: because so many people say "AMD BEat IntEl hurrdprorpdr" ... The success of AMD in PC gaming doesnt negate Intel's success everywhere else:

Well well well, its that time of year for me to write a DD post for the 50 odd people that will see it and the 2 people that will actually read this fuckin thing but here goes. Boomer stocks; especially AT&amp;t and GE, are generally looked down on by this forum and for good reason. I took a look at Stocktwits and when AT&amp;T moved up 1 FUCKING percent, people were freaking out, acting as if the messiah had returned or some bullshit. Well, I have reason to believe it's going to move a lot more than just 1 percent over the next month.

First: Potential Price Upgrade?

Currently, Morningstar has a price target of $37 per share, a very nice increase from the current stock price. This is primarily because of Time Warner's willingness to move forwards and keep releasing movies (Some pretty big names such as Godzilla, Mortal Combat, and the Conjuring), even with the Vurus shutting down theaters across the country. Also, AT&amp;T is bidding out DirectTV (even at a potential loss), freeing up its assets for better opportunities.

Second: Technicals:

I will link another post with some technical voodoo in it, but they look good according to my crayon vision. Again, within the next year this could easily hit $37 per share, considering this still has not fully recovered from the crash of March.

This is the major reason as to why I am very interested in this stock. Also, because of the incredibly low IV, options are cheap as hell currently, even ITM monthlys.

Finally, if you want to look at my track record, my two major plays this year was a certain vaccine company (Ticker is banned) back in March, managed to make quite a nice amount off of them when the stock went from my buy in at a little over a dollar to my sale of $6 per share, and my latest play was 369 APHA $17.5 Jan 15 calls which printed like mofos. (You can see my shitty dd on these in past posts).

Anyways, I am not a financial consultant and if you buy anything, do it on your own accord please!

Position (Relatively small): 40 $T $30C Jan 15/21

I also have 100 shares of GME currently.

Okay you retards. Hear me out.

This isnt your typical DD because like you all I only know stonks go up and this stonk just goes up and has been for the past 3 months.

$KSS has had a 95% run up over the last month and I feel like its just getting primed and ready for us to take a hold of it and send it to the moon.

Holidays are coming up, Black Friday just popped off, they had a killer earnings and are just warming up.

Good luck retards. Godspeed

Title: CDprojekt DD
It's going to moon.

You like RPGs? You'll buy Cyberpunk.

You like Ubisoft's new Assassin's Creed games? You'll buy  Cyberpunk because Ubisoft basically copy pasted Witcher 3's style. 

You like shooters or shooters with RPG elements? You'll buy Cyberpunk.

You like GTA? You'll buy Cyberpunk.

You bought PS5, Xbox X or S? You'll definitely buy Cyberpunk.

You somehow bought one of those new Nvidia or Radeon GPUs? You'll definitely buy and play in 4k just to flex in front of your gay friends.

You are stuck with PS4, old PCs or old Shitbox? No worries unlike Ubisoft or EA CDprojekt actually made sure that poorfags can run it on low settings  

But what about multiplayer. Call of Homos earned 3 Billion dollars hurr Durr. Multiplayer for Cyberpunk was done by a dedicated separate team and it will come.

DLC? Comming and unlike EA bullshit those DLCs will probably feel like sequels ( at least the Witcher 3 ones did).

Still not convinced?

Witcher 4 or just a return to that universe will happen sooner or later.

Current price? Around $29-30. Now look at other major game developers and try to buy something for $30. Yeah you won't find it.

Plus they own GOG, sure it's not Steam but it's still ok.

In short CDprojekt has a game that anyone owning PS4, PS5, old Xbox, new Xbox, potato PC, 8k capable PC will want to play this Christmas.

Yup they are launching just in time for rich divorced parents to fill that void in little Timmy's heart with a new gaming PC and a game he told Santa about.

Still not buying ok invest in NIO and watch Trump delist it just before he leaves the office.

And yeah this entire post is a pump but unlike other companies CDprojekt deserves to hit at least half of EAs value.

Title: Cinemark ($CNK) is Good and So Can You!
Whats up fellow autists. Ive been a lurker of this subreddit for a few years now and always enjoyed the content, the shitposts, the memes, and the rare DDs. But this week, Ive feeling for my fellow retards, especially those that gambled their 401ks and Holographic Charizard Pokemon cards on $PLTR. Orders on $ROPE seem to be up BIGLY over the past week, so I wanted to offer a bit of DD on an industry that you and your Netflix and Chill partner have become well acquainted with this year being stuck at home. At the very least, you owe it to your hand to hear me out about Cinemark ($CNK).

TLDR: $CNK 15 Jan 22, 20 Strike Bought Calls / $CNK 19 Mar 21, 12.5 Strike Sold Puts

So quickly, just to get this out of the way: I am a curator of shit. I originally started this reddit account several years ago because I got tired of playing shitty Super Mario Maker levels and had finally decided to make my own. Then, a year later, I was on a Pokemon kick and was desperately looking to trade Pokemon on my 3ds. Its where I learned to sift through shitty trades and allowed my autism to truly flourish. You ever need a 5 IV hacked Japanese Ditto to get a perfectly specd egg? Do you have any idea what the hell Im talking about? No, probably not. But I bring this up because when youre willing look into the details so much for a fucking Pokemon, it only makes sense to use that same treatment for a financial investment. And just like Super Mario Maker, I got tired of seeing shitty trades and wanted to do something myself. So I went and studied markets and options the past four years and will likely make a career out of finance now. 

But youre here to learn about Cinemark. And heres what you already know: Movie theaters have been absolutely crippled by Covid. Thats no secret. And just when vaccine news helps to get the likes of CNK and AMC back on their feet a bit, Warner Bros comes out yesterday and says they are moving all of their films to HBO Max. This announcement alone sent movie stocks tumbling as much as 20%.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/warner-bros-to-release-movies-on-hbo-max-threatening-theatrical-windows.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/warner-bros-to-release-movies-on-hbo-max-threatening-theatrical-windows.html)

To add insult to injury, AMC had already announced ANOTHER 200 million shares in a public stock offering THAT MORNING to raise money, with their CEO going on to threaten investors that AMC will go bankrupt without help. This probably isnt the first time youve heard of a possible AMC bankruptcy either, especially if youre a subscriber to this very subreddit.

[https://investorplace.com/2020/12/amc-stock-why-amc-entertainment-shares-sunk-16-today/](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/amc-stock-why-amc-entertainment-shares-sunk-16-today/)

And here is where Im gonna start throwing some numbers at you. Because as awful as it is to threaten investors with the fear of bankruptcy, the reality is that AMC is in SERIOUS financial trouble. Pulled from TD Ameritrade, heres a few numbers for you from their balance sheet (as of their earnings in Q3 2020):

Assets:

Cash/Cash Equivalents: $506 million

Total Current Assets: $609 Million

Prop./Plant/Equip, Net: $6,808 million

Total Assets: $10,876 million

Liabilities:

Current Accounts Payable/Accrued Expenses: $1,057 million

Total Current Liabilities: $1,588 million

Total Debt: $5,919 million

Total Liabilities: $13,246 million

So I know what youre thinking: TLDR, StOp NuMbErs GiVe PoSiTiOnS ReTaRd. And Ill get there, just like George R.R. Martin is getting to the end of the Game of Thrones series. But what is really important to see here is that for the CURRENT period that ends in one year, AMC has a deficit of $979 million ($1,588 million in current liabilities minus $609 million in current assets). And normally, when in such a situation, you generally have three solutions: go offer more stock; go sell some of your company; or, you take out loans with a creditor. AMC is doing the former with a stock offering. But why not go to a creditor and get a loan? Well, maybe its because YTD for Q1, Q2, and Q3, AMC has already drawn down a shit town of debt out just to cover their ass. Creditors likely will not be willing to finance this sinking ship much longer and AMC are in legitimate trouble.

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/13/amc-could-run-out-of-cash-by-then-end-of-2020-company-warns.html

So this brings me to Cinemark and their balance sheet. And its here Ill give you a few more numbers from their Q3 2020 Balance Sheet:

Assets:

Cash/Equivalents: $826 million

Total Current Assets: $984 million

Prop./Plant/Equip, Net: $2,832 million

Total Assets: $5,803 million

Liabilities:

Accounts Payable/Accrued Expenses: $599 million

Total Current Liabilities: $624 million

Total Debt: $2,519 million

Total Liabilities: $4,796 million

So Id like to immediately draw your attention to the current period for CNK. Due to their stronger cash position (which in fairness, has been due to financing this year as well), they have a net surplus of $360 million for the next 12 months. Whats more, they can cover ALL of their current liabilities with their cash position alone for the next year. This is to say that if you believe that the Covid will be behind us within a year and that movie theaters will at least by open back to full capacity, Cinemark has the financial strength to survive another year without any sales.

The next thing Id like to bring to your attention is the SIZE of both companies. If you look at the Prop./Plant/Equipment for AMC and CNK, youll see that

AMC has $6,808 million in assets

CNK has $2,832 million in assets

AMC is the largest movie theater company in the world, and here, it shows. They are over twice the size of Cinemark in property alone, and their total assets are just over twice the value of Cinemarks as well. So AMC does have quite a bit of market share on the movie theater industry. However, with AMCs financial weakness and a looming threat of bankruptcy, here are some possible outcomes:

1. AMC goes bankrupt. They will have to reorganize their corporate structure and will likely lose some of their theaters along the way. Competitors may have the option to buy some of these theaters and AMC loses some of their market share which could be beneficial for CNK.

2. AMC looks to merge. This is true for the larger market as a whole, but with belabored businesses that are on the verge of bankruptcy, mergers and acquisitions look to be a huge market in the upcoming year. And while Cinemark doesnt have the financial strength, on paper, to take on the massive debts the AMC currently holds, there is something to consider here in the numbers. If AMC is twice the size of Cinemark, Cinemarks market share would increase by 3x on an outright acquisition of AMC (and thats assuming they took on their debts as they stand today). Cinemark would more than double their debt in doing so, but CNK has also shown that they can manage their book better. They may see the added market share as a warrantable risk to take on.

3. AMC gets the funding it needs and survives in the short term. Cinemark isnt really affected by this outcome.

Next, lets consider the technicals of Cinemark. Cinemark was trading just above $30 before the great stock market fall back in March. It was trading as low as $5.71 at its lowest, and outside a one month period from the end of September to November 9th(vaccine news day), CNK was trading in a price channel that bottomed out around $10. With positive vaccine news in that will allow likely allow CNK to open its doors again in the next six months, it seems unlikely that CNK will break a fairly strong level of support moving forward.

The last part, admittedly, is a bit of my own opinion. But since the election and Pfizer/Modernas vaccine news, there has been a large shift in money across the markets. Specifically, money in the NASDAQ (Covid-proof) tech sector moved outwards towards other sectors, including stocks that were rightfully battered due to Covid. Retail, energy, and entertainment all saw large boosts with Covid relief. You dont have to look much farther than stocks like Kohls (KSS), Nordstrom (JWN), Marathon Petroleum (MPC), Airlines (any of them), or cruise lines, all while watching tech largely stagnate (except for beloved meme stocks like Tesla and AMD, of course). Many of these are still trading below their pre-covid highs, and it is where I personally believe large, institutional money is moving and holding large portions of money. Sure, Covid cases are spiking at the moment and there is an argument to be made for the NASDAQ taking up arms again. But the stock market is a forward looking instrument and is now looking ahead to a point in time when Covid has been dealt with.

So to bring this all full circle, here is my TLDR for why Cinemark is a stock you should seriously consider looking into:

1. It has the financial strength to survive for at least another year, well past the point of covid vaccinations and a return to normalcy.

2. With AMC on the ropes, CNK could stand to benefit from an increase in market share if AMC does file bankruptcy. They could even pick up existing AMC theaters for significantly cheaper if such a corporate AMC structure were to occur.

3. While still trading below its pre-Covid highs (and for veritable reason), vaccine news and actual vaccinations only stand to help stocks in the entertainment sector (barring a failed vaccine, of course). And while Covid cases are certainly rising in the short term, because CNK has the financial backing to weather another year, it is a short term headwind that will likely be overtaken when vaccinations ramp up.

Positions? TLDR? Give yourself a year on this one. Buy a leap and leave it for a while. If you hate getting cucked by Theta decay, maybe sell some 10 or 12.5 strike OTM puts. That way, if you end up getting put shares, its of a stock you wanted long term anyway (and you got paid to get put into it). Premiums for such a volatile industry and very high right now and there is good money to be made in Theta and Vega.

CNK 15 Jan 2022 20 Bought Call: 4.00 (as of this writing)

CNK 19 March 2021 12.5 Sold Put: 2.40 (as of this writing). With a breakeven of 10.10, this puts you just above support if you do get put. If Cinemark is trading above $12.50 in 3 months time, this is a 19.2% ROI (or 6.4% a month), which is still a hell of a return (especially if you believe in the stock long term, like I do).

Title: Rolls Royce recovery
On Dec 1st RYCEY paid out a $1.90 dividend per share which dropped the shares from ~3.40 to ~1.60. Since the dip it has recovered to ~2.30. I believe in the next few weeks that this stock will not only make a huge recovery but next year I believe this stock will return to ATH. My reasoning behind this is that rolls royce makes a shitload of airline engines, obviously covid fucked traveling and hence maintenance and purchases of new jet engines. If you look at the 1 year chart you can see that this stock hasn't recovered at all since March and has been consistently dropping. I believe this company has been overlooked for so long because of the low share price and inability to trade options on them. This stock should make a steep recovery to the $5-$10 range in the coming year once travel has been brought back to normal levels. This isn't alot but think of it like this for every $2 you put in out comes $5 to $10, seems like a great trade right? Well it is, so load up on as many shares as you can and once the share prices get back to normal you can sell options to all the other autists hopping on the Rolls Royce train. Oh, a little tip for the ones who read this whole thing hopefully in the following quarters we will get a phatass dividend payout like before and you can DRIP it into your current position causing a snowball effect on your new shiny investment.

TLDR:All in RYCEY

Dear Fellow Autists,

If you're feeling lazy and don't want to do your own DD but still want to throw around some cash for some swing trading (In typical autist fashion) -- I have found throwing darts at some of the 'Top Ranked' analyst picks hasn't been the worst strategy.

Simply click into some of the top analyst profiles on Tipranks (not allowed to post links, and no this is not some weird marketing campaign) and check out some of the more active analyst's recent picks.

They definitely have potential to reach their highs from last quarter and even beyond that.

Title: 17 Education &amp; Technology Group ($YQ)
$YQ just started trading on the NASDAQ today and falls under the new category of Education Technology (EDTECH)similar to Kahn Academy or Chegg. It has a market cap of just under $2bn with 2019 revenue just over $400m so a Price/Sales of 5X compared to $CHGG which has a market cap of $9.81bn and 2019 revenue of $410m so a Price/Sales of \~24X.

The Chinese EdTech market is expected to grow to $580bn by 2023 per [analysts](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/12/11/1959145/0/en/Outlook-on-China-s-572Bn-Education-Market-2019-2023-K-12-After-School-Tutoring-Higher-Education.html)

$YQ has an expected CAGR of 11.3% from 2018 to 2023.

If $YQ was valued similarly to CHEGG this represents close to a 5X upside and this doesn't factor in that YQ has a larger EdTech market in China than CHEGG has in the US.

Title: HYAC - SPAC merger with Arko Holdings LTD - your next play
HYAC is having the final merger meeting in 4 days, likely proceeded by ticker change around Thursday next week.

The last 2 SPAC mergers, QS on Nov.27, and LAZR since... Yesterday,  have popped in over ~150% gains in the week of the merger (including substantial dips). 

Arko Holdings LTD. is an Israeli-based company which owns over 3000 retail stores in USA over 20+ states, and looking for further business expansion next year.

My DD is based off their positive financials and revenue growth over COVID which leaves more hope for the future of brick&amp;mortar stores, and they operate in convenience / groceries, which reminds me of $USFD (US Foods, spiking ~80% in the last 2 months), and a little of foreign companies like OZON (Russian e-commerce retailer similar to shop or amazon), gaining 20% in the last two weeks since IPO, due to foreigner companies doing US business/stock exchange.

Most importantly, last 2 SPAC mergers in QS and LAZR, are looking fire hot right now in their valuation increases, while both are in the EV bubble, Arko is already well established, and for a company about to merge at NAV, they are grossly undervalued. Arko Holdings trades on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange at ~76 USD, while remaining at ~10 USD NAV on NYSE.

HYAC + Arko SPAC will likely pop in the coming days, get it in while you can.

TLDR: New SPAC merger between HYAC and ARKO HOLDINGS sitting at NAV($10), very high upsides due to people on the EV train/bubble and not looking at other companies with established financials and growth - recent mergers in QS and LAZR indicate potential pops with low downsides. Get in while you can

Title: OFS Credit Fund trading at big time discount
Small BDC. Trading at 65 cents of net asset value. 10% dividend yield. They cut their dividend in half Q220 and cut their mgt fee. Historically has traded at $11-14 like clockwork. Portfolio is rebounding given broader credit market is rebounding (they were pounded during COVID). Once they reestablish their dividend on this thing you have a 20% current yielding asset + 100% upside (trading at $7.16[TO THE MOOOON](https://www.ofscapital.com)). Company just turned on the buy back program which means they think that the market is full of a bunch of gay bears and that they are alpha bulls. Thats the thesis.

Check out the other strong BDCs like ARCC and WHF who have pretty much entirely rebounded from COVID tank. Credit markets are HOT right now, and all these BDCs own the same type of lower middle market / middle market credits. Once the dividend is turned back on, OFS to the moon

Title: VEEVA SYSTEMS (VEEV) EXTREMELY UNDERVALUED
I could make this some long technical DD analysis of the company, but all you need is a few google searches to see how great of a company this is. 

All you really have to know is that these recent earnings were KILLER. Due to AH volatility, this was NOT reflected post-market, with p&amp;ds flooding out and the stock seeing -9% the next morning. 

However, based on MAJOR PT upgrades, the stock has retraced hard back to previous PT levels at $275 and is holding very strong. The recent analysis have 5/7 analysts rating the stock a buy with a target at $301, and Morgan Stanley setting targets at $332-$532 under a bull scenario.

The only thing thats missing is the volume...

Thats where Cramer comes in.

Straight from CNBC: 
Veeva Systems: People didnt like the quarter yesterday and that causes me to think what we ought to do is just bring Veeva on [the show], rather than make a snap judgment because its been such an unbelievable performer over the years. Im not going to abandon ship. -Cramer

I think its fair to say that if anyone can meme a meme stock, its this stupid motherfucker. Doesnt matter if its a pump &amp; dump like it usually is with this stock or if it genuinely ladders its way all the way to the moon, but this shits going back to $300-330 and its going back SOON.

Title: I've got 15k in CALX calls, here's why
[Here's the chart for those who like crayons like me][https://i.imgur.com/bsmeOzF.png]


Hey y'all. I've put my entire savings into calls on CALX. I know, I'm a retard. But that's okay- you can be too! Let me give you a breakdown on why I think this stonk could be a good source of income for your wife's boyfriend's cockring collection while leaving you enough for the new TSLA.


#**Calix Inc.**
   Straight from the wiki, Calix is described as a "global provider of the cloud and software platforms, systems and services to deliver unified access networks and smart premises systems." Wtf does this mean? In simple terms this means that if you use Verizon or one of 1400 other telcom services in the country, you're using Calix technology. 


  Now, you might be thinking *but MisfitCapitalist, aren't telcoms boring?* **WRONG.** This fucker has rocketed over 300% since March and it isn't just because of muh V-shaped recovery. It's because they are frontrunning for integration of more 5g and 10g networks SPECIFICALLY for e-learning. That's right- when we're all stuck at home watching the world burn, the zoomers will be forced to slurp from the sweet Calix juice box. 


  They just got integration across East Texas. That's just the start, baby. Their current market cap is only 1.39 billion, which means it's fucking small, like ~~my~~ your penis. However, unlike ~~my~~ your penis, this thing can really grow. They just had really solid earnings in October and I've waited for the stock to cool off before loading up again. I think now is the time.

#**tl;dr what strike etc.** 
##Buy CALX 30c 1/15 because COVID is outta control and more lockdowns = more e-learning. If we buy enough calls this thing will go to the moon.

Title: CVS stock: to the... atmosphere?
With all this vaccine talk I'm seeing discussion as to whether or not CVS is going to ride the wave to tendies... but does it matter? We neglect the power boomers still hold, a lot of them seem to think it's going to ride this wave. People are debating whether or not CVS will moon because of the vaccine, but I don't think it matters whether or not it will. We have to consider the social factors here rather than the actual economics. That's where most of these stocks get their value from anyway (think about all of the obscenely overvalued stocks continuing to rise). CVS will pump out a fuck ton of vaccines, and that is in itself enough of a social factor to drive the stock upward. Plus, the vaccine may actually draw them a big boost in revenue. Either way, I think it continues rising for the next 8-12 months. Some are suggesting the margins on these vaccines will be high, other people are saying they won't be able to keep up with demand (although if you're waiting 50 min for a vaccine, doesn't that at least increase the chance someone buys severely overpriced candy, drinks, etc?) and that there is no margin. Who cares? It's something with a narrative to defend its rise. Get on now, laugh at the boomers whose share buying will prop up your calls.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of talking ourselves into these retarded stocks that *may* someday have a sliver of a chance at making real money, let's consider one that at least already makes money.

&amp;#x200B;

CVS 75c 5/21/20

Title: C3.ai IPO has the qualifications of a meme stock
Well lets see:

1- Has all the cool buzz words: AI, Big Data, Cloud, App store, etc.
2- Not sure what they do exactly.
3- Cool ticker symbol : AI
4- Microsoft is an investor at IPO price (basically they did the DD for us).
5- Tech stock.
6- Mid cap.

TL;DR:

C3.ai [IPO](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tom-siebels-ai-software-firm-is-about-to-list-via-ipo-51607027370) next week (ticker: AI) can't go tits up.

Title: STPK is literally the best spac play all year
So starpeak energy is merging with a company called Stem which is a market leader in AI Driven Energy storage systems which means STEM is the only one of this type of company on the market.

1.5billion marketcap
600mil cash after merger q1 2021
Stem 125% revenue growth this year which is similar to SNOW and therefore demands a huge valuation.

if you arent buying this stock with that level of growth at that valuation you are stupid

Title: Over 2b$ in pre-orders as of 2018. Likely significantly more by now. Buy SOLO, the only true EV stock set to unlock hyper-growth
https://investorplace.com/2020/11/20-isnt-a-pipe-dream-for-electrameccanica-stock/

Author - Luke Lango, not only fucks, he fucks HARD. He called JMIA at 8. LAZR at 11. CELH at 18. 
He's calling SOLO the EV hypergrowth stock. PT 20+ Buy the dip. Next week we ride. January calls are free money. +1700% expected EPS growth Q1 of 2021. 

This company is sitting at a criminally undervalued market capitalization for what they offer and how many company contracts and pre orders they have lined up. I Won't rest until the market realizes this is a 2b$ company. It's worth more but I'd settle at that.
(2b market capitalization at these levels would translate to ~28$ share price.)


P.s. if you're retarded and can't read he made a video for you. Buy anything this guy says and make money.

Title: DD on SPCE
Its called SPCE which is close to the word SPACE.

Title: DMYD new buy looking juicy
so basically DMYD (spac) is going to be merging with Genius sports. This company provide gambling companies with the data needed to run their operations. Genius sports has deals with draftkings, fan duel and pretty much every single uk betting provider (skybet, WH, ladbrokes and so on). the business works by them acquiring data from sporting events and then relaying it back to betting bookers. they have deals with the premier league, NBA, Nascar and many others. the way i see it with online betting becoming more and more available in the USA ( CAGR 31%) it only makes sense to buy a company that is going to expand.  this market is also a duopoly with their only real competition being Sportsradar which is private. the company if my memory serves me right did 140m in rev last year and is currently profitable. The SPAC has a very good management team behind it and is trading around 11 dollars i can easily see this pumping upwards. Its like selling shovels to gold miners if you missed the draftkings train. the second best train is the one that provides data to draft kings.

DMYD TO THE MOON

Title: AQMS - Basic DD
*This is an ESG/EV/Solar play, so Im hoping for a long term hold or fast rise.*

AQMS, Aqua Metals recycles lead for lead-acid batteries. Tesla uses Lithium batteries currently, but AQMS hype has gone up along with Tesla, see chart below.

https://ibb.co/nMFKFWd
**google trends data**

This play does not have a catalyst other than the general EV hype, and if an actual EV company even mentions lead this will pump

I like this ticker compared to VALE or other companies which produce a battery component because this one is almost purely lead, and it also is quite volatile naturally

**My position: shares, only shares for this**

Title: For all new retards coming with their first $500 from daddy...
Ill keep this short and sweet for you illiterate members, But $LAZR (pew pew) for meme tier gainz up big since changing tickers, future of meme EV stocks, hop in like ur moms boyfriend 

$LAZR 1/15/22 22.5c

Title: NNOX and 3D Reconstruction.
CAT scan = Computerised Axial Tomography. Older scanners needed to do one slice every 2 or 3 millimetres. Very slow. Large radiation dose. Largely phased out. Newer machines are helical scanners. Take pictures in a spiral, not slices. Much faster, much less radiation.

Current CAT scanners have software to enable 3D reconstruction of solid objects: like bones. The reconstructed image can then be rotated so you can see what it looks like in 3D. As you can imagine, this ability is crucial in several medical / surgical specialties. 

It is not clear if NNOX scans can do this. The presentation yesterday was not clear on this point. The scans are described as tomograms which means slices, but not clear if 3D reconstruction possible AND THIS MATTERS.

The total radiation dose for a NNOX scan also matters, although unlikely an issue. 

Have written to them. Bombard them with the question: does NNOX scan allow 3D reconstruction?

Title:    $ZUO to the Moon ($PLTR potential)
**Tl;dr: Zuora (ZUO) will double by Q1.**

* ZUO is a SaaS company like PLTR and enables subscription commerce for companies who want to transition their businesses from traditional one time transactions to Netflix-like recurring subscriptions.

* Recurring subscription are valued much higher by boomer shareholders (# PLTR), making ZUO an attractive play for every major company on the planet

* ZUO already transact $12B+ of annual subscriptions with massive growth rates

* Unlike PLTR, ZUO has been trading sideways since IPO two years ago and is currently near all time lows. Absolute bargain and can only go up from here! Very cheaply valued compared to nearly all other SaaS companies.



* **Just released an earnings and forecast beat, sending shares up 5.7% premarket. Closed biggest deal in history this quarter. Will keep beating earnings from here according to industry trend.**


* ZUO benefits from the global digitisation trend, which has been accelerated by the pandemic and is expected to further take-off in 2021. Most enterprise companies (massive total addressable market) are very early in their journey, but will eventually transition to recurring subscriptions which ZUO is uniquely positioned to support


* ZUO CEO Tien Tzuo is former Salesforce C-Level exec and an absolute autist nerd. He basically included 3 letters of his last name in the stock name, 100% free money

after stupidly callz naked PLTR, bullz boyz will now go w/ shares for the majority remaining of their pot making it pumping hard in the coming days and squeeze out losers' shortz.

# Intel Advances Progress in Integrated Photonics for Data Centers

 **About the New Technology Building Blocks:** At the Intel Labs virtual event today, Intel demonstrated key progress in critical technology building blocks that are fundamental to the companys integrated photonics research. These technology building blocks  including light generation, amplification, detection, modulation, complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) interface circuits and package integration  are essential to achieve integrated photonics. A prototype shown at the event featured tight coupling of photonics and CMOS technologies, serving as a proof-of-concept of future full integration of optical photonics with core compute silicon. Intel also showcased micro-ring modulators that are 1000x smaller than traditional components. The large size and cost of conventional silicon modulators have been a barrier to bringing optical technology onto server packages, which require the integration of hundreds of these devices. These combined results pave the way for the extended use of silicon photonics beyond the upper layers of the network to inside the server and onto future server packages. 

Intel technology building blocks showcased:

* **Micro-ring modulators:** Conventional silicon modulators take up too much area and are costly to place on IC packages. By developing micro-ring modulators, Intel has miniaturized the modulator by a factor of more than 1,000, thereby eliminating a key barrier to integrating silicon photonics onto a compute package.
* **All-silicon photodetector:** For decades, the industry has believed silicon has virtually no light detection capability in the 1.3-1.6um wavelength range. Intel showcased research that proves otherwise. Lower cost is one of the main benefits of this breakthrough.
* **Integrated semiconductor optical amplifier:** As the focus turns to reducing total power consumption, integrated semiconductor optical amplifiers are an indispensable technology, made possible with the same material used for the integrated laser.
* **Integrated multi-wavelength lasers:** Using a technique called wavelength division multiplexing, separate wavelengths can be used from the same laser to convey more data in the same beam of light. This enables additional data to be transmitted over a single fiber, increasing bandwidth density.
* **Integration:** By tightly integrating silicon photonics and CMOS silicon through advanced packaging techniques, we can gain three benefits: lower power, higher bandwidth and reduced pin count. Intel is the only company that has demonstrated integrated multi-wavelength lasers and semiconductor optical amplifiers, all-silicon photodetectors, and micro-ring modulators on a single technology platform tightly integrated with CMOS silicon. This research breakthrough paves the path for scaling integrated photonics.

Title: Airbnb - the Dean thinks proposed IPO valuation is fair
**What we know:**

Airbnb intends to IPO at a price of $44-50 per share. At the $50 mark, that's a equity valuation of $35 billion. 

**Who TF is the Dean and why should we listen to what he says?**

His name is Aswath Damodaran who is finance professor at NYU and teaches corporate valuation among other things. Sometimes interviewed on CNBC to balance out the crazies. He always says he doesn't aim to time the market, but he did buy TSLA pretty much at the very bottom at $180 some time ago (I always regret not following his trade), although he did sell a bit later around the $600 mark (pre-split).

**Ok, tell me what he valued Airbnb at:**

About $36 billion or $54.41 per share (he takes into account options, warrants, RSUs etc)

**TL:DR**

Buying Airbnb at $54 is a fair price from a valuation perspective. The further below, the better the buy.

Title: DD: OK degenerates. Here's a quick heads up about tomorrow. The merger between $HCCH and Fusion Fuel is happening. Fusion Fuel is a green hydrogen company, who makes hydrogen tendies and is getting ready to launch the rocket to tendie town. Read on if you slept on last 2 SPACs mergers that mooned.
TL;DR below.

HCCH slipped under my radar, but I am thinking it's about to bust open like the Kensington and Quantum Space merger $QS.

If  you didn't see that colossal 80% rise in 1.5 days a few days ago. Then  go peak how hard and fast that green rocket shot up. This time we got a  green hydrogen rocket being gased up by Fusion Fuel and it's taken us to green tendy town. Green  hydrogen batteries and green hydrogen products are riding the ev market,  the green energy market, tech market and this company has got it's fingers in globally and a big sister company who is facilitating growth. This sp

(For the noobs: This is a SPAC merger, SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies) are companies that investors and retail investors buy so that they can merge with a company and give them a large injection of cash and bring that company public. After merger all the stocks and warrants in the SPAC get transferred to the new company and that companies ticker replaces the SPACs. Most SPACs also have a legal guarntee that every share you buy is backed up to 10$ in the event that the merger doesn't go through. )

&amp;#x200B;

Here is some DD from someone who actually likes reading the investor presentations.

&amp;#x200B;

"Anyone holding HCCH has probably seen [their investor presentation](https://hlacquisitions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HL_FF-Investor-Presentation_6.23.20.pdf) by now.

What struck me throughout the presentation was the mention of MagP Inovao being an *exclusive partner* and their CPV solar trackers being exclusive to Fusion Fuel. What I haven't seen discussed on reddit yet is that [MagP Inovao and Fusion Fuel are owned by the same private company](https://keyfh.com/), KFH Investments.

The investor presentation states that "MagP has **constructed**   and installed 20+ solar plants around the world, performing daily   tracker performance monitoring with 98% up-time over the past 10-years".   A different section states that "Fusion Fuels electrolyzer can attach   to CPV modules **already being produced**   by MagP Inovao". Suddenly, it makes sense why Fusion Fuel's   electrolyzers are being built to specifically work with MagP's CPV   trackers. Clearly, there is some manufacturing expertise in place that   Fusion Fuel will benefit from when it comes time to build the   electrolyzers.  

I also haven't seen  solar  irradiation levels discussed in the previous DDs, which are  paramount  to HCCH's play. Portugal and Spain have [the highest levels in Western Europe](https://i.imgur.com/7OsdREP.png). [Here is a detailed look at Portugal specifically](https://i.imgur.com/ZH8drpE.png). This is probably a huge stretch, but KFH also [own a 39 hectate winery](https://medeiroswines.com/en) in the [Moura region](https://i.imgur.com/wCon6rU.png),   which has near peak levels of normal irradiation in Portugal. Again,   probably a huge stretch and I have no idea what the price of land is in   Portugal, I just found this interesting from a synergy standpoint.

The Portugese government [plans to invest USD 7.3B in green hydrogen projects by 2030](https://renewablesnow.com/news/portuguese-govt-approves-national-hydrogen-policy-699832/).   That is great and all IMO, but "New market development (e.g., North   America, MENA, Australia)" being the first thing listed in the investor   presentation timeline (with a timeline of 0-1 years) is what attracted   me. Nikola [paid Nel ASA $30M](https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-orders-enough-electrolysis-equipment-from-nel-to-produce-40000-kgs-of-hydrogen-per-day-79)   this month for enough electrolyzers to power 5 of their planned  fueling  stations @ 8k kg/day. The last 3 slides of Fusion Fuel's  presentation  make some extremely bold claims about the CapEx costs of  their tech vs.  centralized electrylyzers. They claim \~$196 USD/kW vs.  \~$1,064 USD/Kw  for centralized electrolyzers. This is why I'm so  bullish right now."

&amp;#x200B;

 TL;DR You like going to the moon? Here is a rock hard rocket rammed  full of green hydrogen charted for tendie town. Green good, brown bad.

Title: [Real DD] Clever Leaves ($CLVR) is the only pot stock you should own and it will soon be the biggest pot company in the world. Here's why. [Long][Incredible][Wow]
**tl;dr**: [Buy $SMA/$CLVR on or before December 18th](https://i.gyazo.com/a09c1dbe00d673f292f95c9b9f8c2449.png) you idiots. Its $11 right now and up 7% today alone. It's the next PLTR but they actually have a product. $SMA 1/15/2021 $20c. 

Good evening to all  Its your boy, Tales of Stocks here. I have come out of retirement and taken a break from my usual routine of fucking sluts, yachting around the world and getting my toes licked by Dan Bilzerian to speak once again with my follow dumbasses, bagholders, suckers, Young Trillionaires and yes, even the haters. I have come to pump the shit out of **UHHHH I MEAN** I have come to... *recommend* a stock that I think you all should buy. Heh heh, yeah thatll work. You might remember me as [the guy whose reddit post single-handedly killed WeWork](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d6618z/real_dd_i_read_analysed_all_180_pages_of_the/). 

**Clever Leaves** (Listed as $SMA right now, soon to be $CLVR on Dec 18th once theyre added to the Nasdaq) is basically one thing  Theyre a low cost producer of pharmaceutical-grade skunk weed. They have bigass facilities in Columbia  with 10million square feet of cannabis production, and theyre definitely not involved in any cocaine production. If youve seen Narcos, you know that nothing shady ever happens in Columbia. I havent watched it but I have it on good word that theres talk about Plato and Plomo, which I think means Plantains and Plumage. A tropical paradise, no?

So whats the problem with weed companies like ACB, Tilray and Cronos? Well, they put the cart before the horse with their acquisition-before-product strategies. If you dont know what that means because youre a 14 year old using your parents names to make a Robinhood account, it basically means they fucked themselves over by expanding too fast into buying random fucking companies (Bespoke grow rooms, anyone?) with their investor money without actually growing their weed at an affordable rate. The cost of producing weed isnt economical in Canada because the conditions for growing it there suck and the labor costs and taxes are insane. A bunch of companies set up shop in Canada since it was the first real country to legalize weed (**Ur**u**g**u**ay** doesn't count) and because they were fans of some guys called Tim Horton and Terry Fox, but ironically gimped themselves in the process. CLVR is going to sell weed to hipster Europeans who don't know how much they're overpaying, it fucking owns. They already have production and offices in Portugal and Germany. 

CLVR is going to eliminate all competitors in the end. *Period*. Any dumbass can throw a seed in the ground in their backyard and piss on it daily and harvest enough pissweed to get them through the winter. Legalized weed is a cannibalistic exercise and a terrible investment because once you legalize, the margin on the product drops through the floor and it gets really fucking hard to produce the product (you know, the actual weed?) at a price that wont see you burn through cash like an ashy crackhead on his last rock. If you are actually reading this whole post and didn't just glaze over and buy in because it was really long, PM me and I'll send you my wife's boyfriend's nudes that she sends me to mock how much of a loser I am. Regardless, **the only way to make money in legalized weed is to grow at insanely low prices and under cut the competition which will allow you to buy up market share and then buy out the competition, and then start to raise prices**, which is CLVR's strategy. I learned this from a scene in The Wire btw.

I once called ACB the Goodwill of pot stocks because they bring in just about anything they can find and its staffed by retards. CLVR is the opposite, the people running the company have been there from the start and dont get fired and replaced once a year like most Canadian pot stock companies execs. [Here's a video of the CEO explaining their company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkCE-DTSYuA). I gotta be honest kinda zoned out but he doesn't come off like a grifter to me so that's probably a good thing. He used to work in Blackstone and was an actual investor, which is basically the opposite of a WSB poster, so that means he's undoubtedly profitable. The rest of the management and SPAC team is a group of rich-ass investment banker crackers, so you just know they're finna make some coin. Here are some more rocket emojis. 

Does CLVR make any money right now? NOPE. Does that matter? Hell fuckin no, are you retarded?? But do you know how much money that ACB, TLRY and CRON burn through on a monthly basis? An absolute fuckload more. [Here's their prospectus if you want some pretty pictures and fewer words that will convince you that this is the right decision](https://samcospac.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SAMA-Clever-Leaves-LOI-Investor-Presentation.pdf).

To sum up - $CLVR 1/15/2021 $20c, gg ez no re. Peace out and don't forget to thank me later and [follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/talesofstocks) you dumbfucks.

edit: I had to write it like $SMA because dumbass automod removed the original post.

Title: Precipitous Gains for Cleveland Cliffs
The US Steel guy is on to something.  See his original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k380yz/squeeze_on_steel/.  

While US Steel will get its gains, I think an even better opportunity lies with Cleveland Cliffs (CLF).  Cleveland Cliffs is a company that previously specialized in making iron ore pellets.  In the past decade, they have had a market cap in excess of $14B, vs a market cap now of just under $5B.  However, they have recently been on a buying spree.  Cleveland Cliffs acquired AK Steel Holding Corporation in Mar-2020, a company operating 8 steel plants and 2 tube manufacturing plants.  AK Steel is a leading producer of flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steel products.  They are also in the process of acquiring ArcelorMittal USA later in Q4 2020.  What does that give us?  A vertically integrated supply chain, baby!
 
As you can see in their 10Q, theyve nearly tripled their revenue on a quarterly basis over the last year.  The one down side is their net income was fairly low due to high COGS.  This is where the vertically integrated supply chain comes in.  They will be able to take it from the mines to pellets to flat rolled steel and keep all those sweet profits to themselves.  The net margin has trended fairly well over time, with the exception of an odd year or two here and there (2014-2016... ouch!, and 2020).  It has always bounced back though to the 15-20% range.  Add to that the backdrop of steel prices rising ~17% in the last two months, and you have some very profitable quarters incoming.  Additionally, their current ratio is very good, so despite making acquisitions, they have maintained a rock-solid balance sheet, pun intended.  I think this could run up to low 30s.  Look at what the steel industry does: overreacts to supply and demand.  I can smell the tendies already.

1200 shares of X @ 9.40

Title: Forget PLTR, Micro Focus (MFGP) is your ticket to tendie-town!! DD inside
Listen up fellow degenerates. Micro Focus has had HORRIBLE returns over the last 2 years and it's been a shitshow.  Was around $30 in March 2019, and hit lows of under $3 a month ago. So why dip into this piece of shit now? **Cash flow**, motherfucker! Even with lower year over year profits (mostly cause of a stupid non-cash impairment charge), they made "[free cash flow of $304.9m](https://www.microfocus.com/media/investors-press-release/interim-results-2020-press-release.pdf) in the six months ended 30 April 2020"!!! And in the [interim results](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-micro-focus-international-stock-surged-today-2020-11-18) released in November, they're projecting THREE BILLION in revenue for the full year. 

And you know what the market cap is, even after the price rose recently to just under $6?  $1.9 billion! Let me tell ya, this ain't no fucking AMC with closed down theaters in the middle of a pandemic. This is a British enterprise **technology company selling for less than revenue**! You know what PLTR's Price to Sales ratio is? Over 40, you fucking imbeciles. 

And what kind of technology is this? **FUCKING COBOL**. You know that shit your grandpa coded to pay gas for your grandma's boyfriend's 1972 VW Beetle. Yeah, that. It's still around and companies can't find enough help to maintain their two thousand year old mainframes. [Companies and governments need help with COBOL!](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/04/20/brush-up-your-cobol-why-is-a-60-year-old-language-suddenly-in-demand/) You know who competes with MFGP on COBOL? Eye-Bee-fucking-Em. IBM! No one else is going to compete with Micro Focus on this cause it's just so goddamn boring. I dare you, f me one goddamn degenerate on this board that funded their loss porn through COBOL. But you know what, whatever boring ass shit Micro Focus does, they're goddamn good at it. Migrating old companies to the cloud? Done! And it's not just me saying this. **Even Jeff Fucking Bezos loves them**. [Amazon Web Services picked just four partners for Cloud Migration](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/03/micro-focus-international-stock-pops-on-amazon-par/), and you know who's in that exclusive list? That's right, Micro Focus. 

And if any of you retards think this baby's going bankrupt, you can go back to jerking off on your loss porn. They got more than 1 billion dollars in liquidity, and they've been whittling down their debt, reducing it by more than $400 million this past year. And don't forget there are lines of yield-hungry Europeans willing to get shitty interest on their money cause you know what other options they got? None! So even though they got $4.2 Billion dollars worth of it, thanks to their [successful refinancing](http://otp.investis.com/clients/uk/microfocus/rns/regulatory-story.aspx?cid=108&amp;newsid=1393816) earlier this year, they don't have any debt due until June 2024! 

So how much tendies we talking about here? No, not that Wendy's shit. Fucking Fuddruckers tendies with nacho cheese, retard. With a fucking OSTRICH burger on the side. Let's say they get to a 3x price/sales multiple, which is dirt cheap for a Technology company. That would lead to a share price of almost $30! 5x the current price. Those paper handed retards at Seeking Alpha were calling this company Micro FuckUs earlier this year, but you know what? Unlike them, maybe **we like getting fucked if it means we make a shitload of money in the end.** So join me on the Micro FuckUs Tendie Train, shares or April 2020 options work (don't get earlier options, so you can benefit from likely positive year-end earnings), and let's get rich motherfuckers.

Title: The Future Of Plastics
Good Morning Degenerates,

&amp;#x200B;

Welcome to today's History &amp; Science Class. Today, we will be learning about plastics.

Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are renewably-derived polymers that are entirely biodegradable and compostable. As you may know, other polymers require industrial recycling to be broken down. Authentic tards may be familiar with the PHA firm Metabolix, now called Yield10 Bioscience, which sank millions of tendies a few years ago developing the same science. The market was not ready then - but now - This Is The Way.

If you haven't heard from the likes of Robert Downey Jr yet, then here's the present. We generate over 300 million metric tons of plastic - equal to the weight of the entire human population. You think electric cars and solar power are the only way to solve our problems and go green? Think again.

The PHA market is approximately 1% of the entire plastic market. The largest barrier for this emerging market is the cost of raw materials, and refinding said materials. With that, the inability to achieve economies of scales is the largest, and one of the only major restrictions on the market.

Now turn to Danimer Scientific. This company has been a leader in PHAs for years on years as a privately-run company. Now I'm only half-stupid so I'm not sure if any posts have been made about this, but the SPAC Live Oak Aquisition Corp ($LOAK) has a definitive merger agreement with Danimer Scientific, providing $200 million in equity of the $890 closing equity valuation. Danimer Scientific is anticipated to go public as early as the end of this year, or early 2021.

What's this? Too good to be true? You heard me right, bitch. You better steal every last dime from your wife's boyfriend's wallet, because this is the future. One's first thought might be, " Well, if this failed before, who's to say it yields now?"

Hear ye, motherfucker. Think:

\-Green New Deal

\-Net-zero emissions and carbon neutrality

\-Global Paris Agreement

&amp;#x200B;

Danimer already has deals with the likes of Coca-Cola, Columbia, and Nestle. With the current deals they have, they are already at capacity. The funding secured from the merger, private investors, etc. will provide the necessary funding to develop another factory. With the funding already secured, they are prepared to increase production capacity 10x by 2025, thus increasing scale and profitability. The company has only around 20 million in debt, and has the growth potential of fucking Apple or Tesla. I will pour my life savings into this just to prove that I am right. I'll see you on the other side bitches.

If you do any DD on PHAs you'll find Danimer right in the Top 5 of the global list. If you want to waste your tendies on PLTR and NIO calls I don't give a shit, but this is the future.

Title: DD for the $GME Tribe (you $PLTR weirdos are welcome to listen in too)
  

I havent seen this anywhere, so I would like to call your attention to a few recent job announcements from our friends at your and my new favorite Texas Corporation: GameStop (fuck off, Whataburger). 

Since **mid-November**and right after RC sent his soon to be legendary letter to the BoardGameStop posted some mighty interesting job announcements for its Grapevine HQs. Especially for a Dying-Brick-and-Mortar-90s-Mall-Bro-Boomer company. 

It definitely seems like this Blockbuster redux is TOTALLY uninterested in pivoting to e-commerce, digital monetization, and a technologically-driven marketing infrastructure and product distribution landscape. 

Just find em in the mall.

Or else you bears are just fucking stupid and cant read or understand words good.

But you dont have to take my word for it. Do the clickity clickity and the read-y read-y. 

I think youll find it just as odd as I do that a soon-to-be-bankrupt boomer company just published a bunch of silicon-valley-jargon-filled-digital-monetization-bla bla jobs right before everyone is wondering if theyre going to pivot away from being Another Cautionary Tale and toward a Fuck Yeah E-commerce-centric Money Minting Technology-driven Gaming Company Youre Gonna Tell Your Goddamn Grandkids About When Youre Old and Rich (and hopefully fulfilled spiritually and emotionally after many kind and generous years of philanthropy and a lot of self-care and reflection)

Check out some of the highlights below. Or dont. I dont give a shit. But GTFO of here with any kind of tHis StOcK iS BlOckBusTeR comparisons any more you simps. 

Was planning to sell a bit before earnings to buy back after the possible dip. Im now seeing that as an unacceptably risky investment strategy in this particular instance.

Were coming for you, Melvin. Tick Tock.

Title: Confidence
I've been doing research on how I can benefit from the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. It hasn't been enacted yet, but every year for the last 60 years it has been. SO **fairly** good chance it will be this time too. The private military complex thrives on this Authorization Act. Now obviously it's called private for a reason they aren't on the stock market (for sure not on Robinhood). There is however a major investment company [APO (Apollo Global Management)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Global_Management) that purchased [Constellis Holdings](https://www.constellis.com/) the largest private military contractor in the world to join in their conglomerate.  We're talking about an ACT that is $740.5 billion for national defense programs, including $636.4 billion for the Department of Defense, $25.9 billion for national security programs within the Department of Energy, and $69 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. Constellis Holdings gets  contracts from all THREE of these Departments and their parent company gets all the gains from it. I can say with confidence APO will reach $55-$60per share by jan-feb of 2021.

Title: $MP  Will the Real EV Stock Please Stand Up
  

Decarbonization of the world is moving towards electrification for sustainability. Neodynium (Nd) and presnodynium (PR) are the main components for rare earth elements in magnets critical for motor technologies in electric vehicles and wind turbines. Military applications include drones, jets, and robots. Thus, magnets will be critical for this push towards environmental sustainability. Two major caveats are that rare earth elements are difficult to separate and almost all production was in Chyna. $MP solves this by the following:

1. Approximately 90% of rare earth element production is done by Chyna. 

a. If things go tits up, Chyna will ban export of rare earth elements such as Japan and grab countries by the balls. [https://www.cnbc.com/id/39318826](https://www.cnbc.com/id/39318826)

2. Mountain Pass in California is the only rare earth mine in the Western Hemisphere which was bought out of bankruptcy in 2017.

a. If you can mine anything in California of all places, you know its sustainable. 

3. Stage 1 for extraction and production of rare earth concentrates is complete and represents 15% of the global supply with profitability. 

a. Stage 2 will be separation of rare earth elements.

b. Stage 3 will be production of rare earth magnets from said separated elements creating a vertically integrated rare earth metals supply chain. 

4. All American fuck yea.

a. DOD invested $10 million in MP.

Market &amp; Financials:

Electric vehicles comprise 5% of the NdPR market. In one decade with meme companies like Nio, Fisker, Tesla, Rivian, this should be 50%. 

2020 EV motor market = $710 million

2030 EV motor market projections = $10.7 billion

Title: PBFX DD Inside
PBFX is a value stock. The PE is 4.1, so if you're looking for the memes, go ahead and move along. It's a boring, undervalued energy logistics company. It also makes a ton of profit, pays an insane dividend, and has been growing its revenue consistently YOY, with minimal impact on its financial outcomes due to the pandemic. For broader energy market reasons, it's still down from its 52 week high by roughly 55%. I've been watching it for a while, and the price action seems to be a more volatile, less liquid proxy for the overall energy sector. There's been a recent rotation into energy/value with investors reacting dramatically to vaccine news, and I think this thing is going to moon as soon as the FDA puts a stamp on Pfizer or Moderna's vaccine. It just topped the 200sma, and has a huge price gap above it, so there's no magic crayons to stop it from regaining at least some of its former glory. Bid/ask is wide, so slippage sucks but I expect this to be at $15 in a couple of months, so it shouldn't matter.

TLDR: PBFX as a vaccine approval announcement play, buy shares or April/July calls. Be ready to hold until FDA approval, maybe 3-6 weeks?

Positions: Shares, $10 &amp; $12.50 April calls, $15 July calls

Title: SPY to 360 by next week (prove me wrong)
&amp;#x200B;

[6 hour SPY chart](https://preview.redd.it/o1z8t1p6lz261.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c8a175d590d1ea2fdd40384d228a12f851590dd)

TLDR: SPY 360 Puts 12/11  


I'm not going to lie, I tend to be a little bearish, but this looks like a great setup for a week long short. Over the last 3 trading sessions, SPY has hit the R1 resistance 3 times, but never breached it to close out the 6 hour candle. 6 hour RSI is at 66.5 (at the time of this post), which is almost at the 70 level after which it's considered overbought by all the algos.  


I believe that over the next week or so it should bounce of off the R1 and approach the pivot line (360ish level).  


This is not even considering all the stimulus talk starts and stops, which most likely won't get announced until the 11th (even if it does). So no immediate catalysts to the upside.  


What am I missing?

Title: CEMI: Get ready to moon you degenerates, $15+ incoming!
Well well well...looks like you degenerates didn't listen and are missing out on the gravy train here. CEMI (Chembio Diagnostics) has been on fire as the world has been on fire due to COVID-19. This company has been doing so well this past month or so. The KEY thing here is that there are only 7...I repeat 7, Antigen tests for COVID-19 worldwide. Not in the US...worldwide. And CEMI has submitted their approval for a rapid antigen test waiting to be approved by the FDA for EUA.

Highlights of what you have missed since my last post:

* 12/2/2020: Chembio Diagnostics Awarded $12.7 Million by BARDA for Development of Rapid DPP Respiratory Antigen Panel and 510(k) Submission of the Rapid DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test System
* 11/13/2020: Chembio received regulatory approval from Agncia Nacional de Vigilncia Sanitria (ANVISA) to market the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen System in Brazil.

That BARDA contract that they won will enable them to create a new test that looks at both Influenza A/B and COVID-19 with their DPP test.

On top of that, they have their 2 tests submitted with the FDA for EUA, the antigen and antibody test. The second those are approved, which is imminent, this thing will skyrocket.

Still long those original shares I posted at the bottom, but added 2000 additional shares on one account and 2500 on another account.

**----Previous Post on 10/16----**

Listen up here you degenerates...its time to do some due diligence on CEMI (Chembio Diagnostics) and make some sweet tendies with it. Chembio is a leading point-of-care diagnostics company focused on detecting and diagnosing infectious diseases who have recently also gotten into creating tests for COVID-19. Here is why I think they are going to skyrocket:

* Chembio submitted an EUA Application for DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test System - Rapid Test Provides Results in Only 20 Minutes (Submitted Oct 15, 2020) ---- BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) has given Chembio their support throughout the development of the antigen system so there is is skin in the game here.
* Chembio submitted an EUA Application for New DPP SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG Test System - New Antibody Test System Provides Results in 15 Minutes from Finger Stick, Venous Whole Blood, Plasma, or Serum Samples (Submitted Sep 8, 2020)
* Chembio just received FDA Approval for DPP HIV-Syphilis System on October 2, 2020. The system includes the DPP HIV-Syphilis assay, a multiplex single-use test, and the DPP Micro Reader optical analyzer, and is being offered inthe United Statesimmediately.

Their platform, DPP, can flex into multiple different areas, and with a recent approval for their HIV-Syphilis test, as well as they are on the fast track for approval for their COVID-19 tests, this will be huge. Now what I will say is there share price went to \~$15 when they released their COVID-19 test, but it didnt show good results so the FDA removed their test from the market and caused the shares to tank. But thats ok, because the new CEO has his head on right and will get this done in the right way, especially with the funding from BARDA.

Any partnership, any approval from the FDA, and this will skyrocket. I am long on 6000 shares @ \~$4.62.

Good luck homies and as always, do your own due diligence to get those sweet tendies.

TL;DR: CEMI target share price of $15+

Title: $FSR is going to the moon

Title: Diabetic Due Diligence on DEXCOM Inc. (DXCM) and Why I BOUGHT THE DIP and YOLOd 80k.
As you autists know, BUY THE FUCKING DIP. For the last few months, I have watched this sub decay into exclusively meme stocks, SPACS, EV, GYNA companies, Weed stocks, and a government backed Skynet. Instead of presenting real buying opportunities, WSB has been filled with pump and dumps and shit stocks. This is not that, this is a real market opportunity to make gains by BUYING THE FUCKING DIP. This DXCM dip has been completely overlooked by WSBets...because once again, you're all fucking degenerate autists. I know this because I am too, I participated in many of the swings and after breaking my neck a couple times, the whiplash caused me to do my own research and fall back on the most basic principle BUY THE FUCKING DIP. 

I believe so strongly in this position that I have YOLO'd $80k into DXCM calls. You can see my positions and my ass at the bottom of this post.

Now my analysis of DXCM is broken down into 7 parts: The Product and Increasing Market Share, \~FuNdAmEnTaLs\~, price targets, Revenue, Earnings, Partnerships, Competition, COVID impacts, and most importantly THE DIP. This post is pretty long, but the TL;DR is that this company is recovering quickly from a massive dip, dominates the market, and presents a great tendies taking opportunity.

**The Product and Increasing Market Share**

DEXCOM is undoubtedly the best diabetes management device in the market and their market shares continue to grow as more Type 1 diabetics are switching from syringes and finger pricks to insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors. 

Dexcom is currently the market leader in continuous glucose monitors. If you don't know what a continuous glucose monitor is, simply put, Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) tracks glucose levels throughout the day and night and can alert Type 1 Diabetics if their levels go too high or low. CGM systems take glucose measurements at regular 5 minute intervals, 24/7, and translate them into dynamic data to show glucose direction and rate of change. Dexcom CGM tracks glucose levels continuously throughout the day and night, while simultaneously sending glucose readings to the user's smart device or receiver every five minutes. Dexcom CGM then translates readings into dynamic data so that Type 1 diabetics are better able to manage treatment.

**\~FuNdAmEnTaLs\~**

**Price Targets and Strong Buy Recommendation** \- Avg Price Target of **$445.60**, Currently trades at $334

DXCM is currently trading more than $100 under its price target and is closing the gap rapidly as it recovers from its recent November dip. See the Analyst Consensus Rating below:

[AVG. PRICE TARGET $445.60](https://preview.redd.it/jceur9o6su261.png?width=834&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b2c196f05dfd7bdf3444e42aa3066d4ac15e4b1)

DXCM is currently rated as a Strong Buy by almost all analysts.

[DXCM = Strong Buy ](https://preview.redd.it/g6x9gc0e8v261.png?width=678&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e967ca9c66ade9770a0419e6ab244a4c2114490)

**Steady Revenue Growth, Balance Sheet, and Growing Market Share -** Dexcom Revenue continues to steadily climb and just passed half a billion last quarter with positive cash flow on its balance sheet, a growing market share, and an increase in Continuous Glucose Monitor users worldwide. 

[Continued Revenue Growth ](https://preview.redd.it/g031y7q60v261.png?width=820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65f86e4f844f99fb49e1d4d8ac09ece7ace2acdd)

**Earnings -** Dexcom does not miss on earnings and has consistently beaten expectations by wide margins. I expect they will continue to do so next year as more diabetics get back to regular endocrinologist appointments. See the graph below:

[DEXCOM ALWAYS BEATS EARNINGS](https://preview.redd.it/u6vuq1vfzu261.png?width=804&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e50be2755bc34b313d7dd6fafa0e2f480997fc9)

**Key Partnerships -** From Wikipedia - "[Tandem Diabetes Care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem_Diabetes_Care) received FDA approval in December 2019 for Control-IQ, a closed-loop technology that uses Tandem's t:slim X2 insulin pump and the Dexcom G6 to "to automatically increase, decrease, or stop the delivery of insulin in response to the glucose levels of people with Type 1 diabetes." Dexcom entered into a partnership with Livongo, a digital chronic care management company, in January 2020 to share CGM data from the Dexcom G6 with Livongos platform. This integration will allow Livongo to incorporate the CGM data along with other patient data to provide health insights based on its algorithm to help patients manage their diabetes. In February 2020, Dexcom and Insulet Corporation signed a non-exclusive, global agreement to combine current and future Dexcom continuous glucose monitoring systems with Insulets tubeless insulin delivery Pod into the Omnipod Horizon System for automated insulin delivery. This will give the ability to adjust insulin doses based on Insulets algorithm or through their smartphone. The company also announced in March 2020 a partnership with Welldoc to integrate G6 CGM data with BlueStar, a digital platform for diabetes management. BlueStar will combine the CGM data with information on patients' activity, nutrition, sleep and other factors to help them manage their condition." [\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexcom#cite_note-25) 

**Little Competition and Positive Market Sentiment**

There are 3 major players in the Continuous Glucose Monitor market. They are Dexcom, Guardian Medtronic, and Freestyle Libre. Dexcom is by far the most advanced, accurate and used device of these three. I will try to highlight the main advantages of the Dexcom over the competition, but I highly recommend you look into the reviews and research around the accuracy and features of these devices. The points below are from SugarMDs - [https://sugarmds.com/dexcom-g6-versus-freestyle-libre-cgm/#:\~:text=CGM(%20Dexcom%20or%20libre)%20is,an%20insulin%20pump%20or%20independently](https://sugarmds.com/dexcom-g6-versus-freestyle-libre-cgm/#:~:text=CGM(%20Dexcom%20or%20libre)%20is,an%20insulin%20pump%20or%20independently)

1) Dexcom has nightime monitoring for increased safety - "One of the biggest risks that a person faces is highs and lows while they are sleeping. A Dexcom G6 and Guardian Medtronic (but not Libre) CGM system can monitor and alert you at night should your blood glucose drops. Unfortunately freestyle libre does not have that feature. You can also choose to notify someone about your blood sugar levels by sharing your glucose data. The timely warning can prevent you from experiencing side effects related to highs and lows.

2) Accuracy - "Between the Dexcom versus libre, Dexcom appears to be more accurate in the low glucose ranges below 80 mg/dL compared to libre."

3) No finger pricks - The dexcom, unlike Guardian Medtronic which needs to be calibrated at least once every 12 hours, does not require any finger pricks to calibrate the device. This saves patients hundreds of dollars on test strips and is one of the best features of the device behind it's accuracy. 

4) Customer Service, Reputation, and Retention - Top of the line customer service that is dedicated to serving patients. "If a sensor stops working or doesnt insert correctly, tech support is easy to get a hold of. After a few questions, they will replace a sensor that does not work. They might even send two." [https://www.lpnutritionconsulting.com/t1d-blog/2020/6/22/dexcom-g6-vs-freestyle-libre](https://www.lpnutritionconsulting.com/t1d-blog/2020/6/22/dexcom-g6-vs-freestyle-libre)

&amp;#x200B;

**COVID Impacts**

1) COVID created increased awareness of the importance of monitoring underlying conditions. I believe this will be a huge driving force behind growing revenues and market shares for Dexcom. Diabetics are now, more than ever, acutely aware of the need to monitor their Diabetes closely and Dexcom is the best product for that.

2) Increased Dexcom orders as patients return to quarterly endocrinologist appointments. Although, Dexcom beats earnings every quarter, I believe they will have even larger beats in 2021 as more patients transition back to seeing their care providers in person and will be able to see the products for themselves in medical offices.  

**Buy the Dip - THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT**

In November, Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen slashed his 12-month price target on the stock from $420 to $350. Biegelsen cited increased competition and pricing pressure in the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) space following the approval of Abbott Labs' Freestyle Libre 3 CGM in Europe. Abbott's CGM system is reportedly priced at $1,066 per year, whereas DexCom's G6 device runs about $2,496 per year.

This slashed price target was unjustified and the Analyst Consensus Rating above confirms that with an average price target of $445.60. It was unjustified for two specific reasons. 

First, there is major consensus and sentiment among diabetics that Dexcom is the most accurate continuous glucose monitor on the market justifying its higher cost (See here - [https://www.lpnutritionconsulting.com/t1d-blog/2020/6/22/dexcom-g6-vs-freestyle-libre](https://www.lpnutritionconsulting.com/t1d-blog/2020/6/22/dexcom-g6-vs-freestyle-libre) or look at r/diabetes_t1 to get a feel for the love that surrounds the Dexcom and the impact that it has on the lives of Type 1 diabetics).

Second, the pricing differential did not justify such a drastic price slash. This is because for an ever growing number of patients insurance covers the cost of these continuous glucose monitors so price isn't a factor as diabetics always hit their deductibles due to insulin costs. Additionally, people do not skimp on price or often choose the cheaper device when it comes to their health. The reliability and accuracy of the Dexcom justifies its higher price. It's the best on the market and diabetics know it. 

Anyway, as you can see from the graph. The stock has dipped from $420 to around $320 in the past month, but is quickly picking up momentum back towards the average analyst price target of $445.60. Moreover, pre-COVID the stock was trading at $456.23 and will likely blow past its ATH over the next year. 

[Dip to $320 in Nov. Currently Rebounding back to $400+](https://preview.redd.it/8gla7g5dpu261.png?width=817&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4d0c429c14096253284c6b447f67e012f4fac4b)

**The Play**

I think this stock will run and run fast over the next couple months in anticipation of February earnings and as institutions dump their money back into a stable medical company. I would recommend playing stocks or long term ATM or ORM LEAP calls as DXCM has low options liquidity atm. The idea is to profit from the November dip that I touched on above. I am in for $80k total. I am all in and believe in this position, I would not be posting if I didn't think this was a sure thing. These are the trades:

**1) $5k in 1/15 $340c** 

https://preview.redd.it/ap19tbarhz261.png?width=1011&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f494eb5ef7f97f1d27b8f39d0e36c8990589833

**2) $45k in 3/19 $340c  (All in on my $20k Roth IRA and $25k in my main)**

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** 

Buy 2021 Leaps on DXCM, they are the best products on the market and currently heavily undervalued and recovering rapidly from a major dip. 

**\*Personal Note and Kiss My Ass\***

On a personal note, I myself am a Type 1 Diabetic that uses the Dexcom CGM. I transitioned earlier this year from the Guardian Medtronic CGM and the device has been life changing. It has lowered my A1C levels, made my diabetes incredibly more manageable, and conveniently links with my iPhone and Apple watch which has made it a very enjoyable device to use. I've also attached a photo of my device so you can also get a feel for what the Dexcom CGM looks like and so that you autist fucks can kiss my ass when this play makes you tendies.

Title: BETZ: The Best Move and True Autists ETF
Alright dipshits listen up, I believe I have the best ETF for WallStreetBets at the moment. BETZ is our best betfor the following reasons...

Online gambling is the future, or at the very least a great investment at the moment

As we move more and more towards online alternatives and change the way we live our lives because of COVID, one can see why the shift towards online gambling alternatives can be a huge market for people to move to. Especially now, and given we don't know how long COVID may last along with its effects, the online gambling industry is ready to pop off as companies like Golden Nugget Online Gaming are getting approved in states left and right by the week.

Price action on BETZ indicates it could keep going up and has room to grow

You'd have to be pretty autistic to not know what i'm talking about in this part. cHaRT gO uPpY iN paST?!?!? cHarT Go uPpY nOW!!!! Pretty simple DD...

Options are cheap, volume is low

Fucking look at the 26c for Jan. .33 per contract when I last looked. When its trading a little less than 24 at the moment. LOOK AT APRIL 29c CONTRACTS! .5 PER CONTRACT
(Im sure these have updated due to price action as of now.)

I know a bunch of you retards can't resist buying options this cheap, so why not do it with a business that is ready to boom and one that has such low volume that we could pump to the moon?

BETZ has holdings in Lancadia, a merger with Golden Nugget Online Gaming (i'll get to why this is important) and other big corporations like DraftKings

If you take a look at the holdings here...

https://www.roundhillinvestments.com/etf/betz/full-holdings

You can see that BETZ has a 5.36% holding in DKNG which has moved over 400% since its entered the market this april. And yet, BETZ hasn't decreased its holding even in the wake of sports being near abismal at the moment due to the pandemic.

Along with this, we see that BETZ has 2.66% holdings in Lancadia Holdings, a blank check company that is currently on track to merge with Golden Nugget Online Gaming on December 18th. Why would this ETF hold shares of Lancadia, which is not officially GNOG yet, when the merger could simply fall through and BETZ could lose a ton of money? I believe its because GNOG has a legit business and actually has better revenue and business than DKNG, and because BETZ recognizes this and has a reasonable certainty that GNOG will go public soon.

The way I see it, is when GNOG merges and becomes public, they will see a huge pump, and BETZ will also increase their holdings in GNOG, pumping BETZ.

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY

THE MEME POTENTIAL IS HIGH WITH THIS ETF

Tell me this....what is more ironic than a bunch of online degenerate gamblers throwing in their life savings into an online gambling ETF? Fucking nothing is more ironic than that.

WE HAVE SEEN THE POWER OF THE MEME

Having all us degenerate gamblers gamble on a gambling stock isn't even a gamble given the amount of power we KNOW WSB has.

TLDR: BETZ is the future with online gambling, WSB gamblers will pump this due to irony.

POSITIONS:

15 contracts of 26c for Jan/15/2021

10 contracts of 29c for April/16/2021

Title: SpaceX needs to go public
I mean, Papa is doing the largest land grab in the history of human civilisation - Starlink. 

The Version 1 Satellites are not linked via lasers and yet are able to provide broadband you can stream 4K on and play online games competitively. The constellation is not even 10% complete. Soon itll be a global service, right now its beta. 

Version 2 Sats, that will be launched 2021 year-end will be interconnected via lasers thereby create an Internet backbone in space that is faster than the Atlantic one. All algo trading bois will have to subscribe otherwise they would miss out on latency advantage. 

Version 3.....n: Im sure Papa will eventually make these capable of telecom (like Iridium but exponentially better), GPS broadcast (two-way like Chinese BeiDou), geospatial image capturing, etc. The Chinese with their BeiDou were already laughing at our primitive GPS constellation. Papa will have the final laugh. 

All this made possible by Starship (in development) that will be able to carry 100 tonne like its nothing at marginal cost of 2 million per launch. I mean some cars cost this much. Papa recently received a patent for constellation that makes it impossible to compete with his constellation unless youre a nation state. 

That Jeff Who guy turned out to be a dud. Always was.

So Papa will take over the world. SpaceX will be about 2 trillion in mk cap long term. 

I want in.

I challenge all PTON  to sign up for the 30 Day FREE PTON digital trial, no PTON equipment needed...but you actually have a credit card that isnt maxed out to sign up, or you could ask your mom or dad. 

To complete the challenge you must workout at least five times a week for a month by doing at least 20 mins of PTON cardio (running, boot camp, cycling class) followed by at least a 10 minute PTON strength or yoga class. 

PTON  are challenged...but now youre challenged to find out why PTON retention is so high and their churn is so low.

Title: All the stocks we like on WSB would rise a lot smoother and stop crashing on top of us if we stopped buying weekly calls and started buying calls at least 1 month out.
Short term weekly calls has theta decaying our calls which makes them worthless the sooner to Friday it comes.

On Friday the stock usually drops because all of the weekly expire.

You need more and more calls to be bought up just to keep the stock from crashing from all the weeklies expiring.

Solution:  Dont buy weeklies, look further out in time like a month or two and look into those strike prices.

Title: MYTHBUSTER: House passed bill to curb Chinese stocks listing. What does it REALLY mean for your $BABA, $NIO etc.
Some first words, **I have no prediction on how these stocks price is gonna move**. I know many of you have a position on these names. And I anticipate that **my post will be heavily downvoted**. I only write because I despise **those trolls who spread fake information for their own benefit**. Even if a couple of people who read my post can avoid the pitfall of being conned, my effort is not wasted.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**What is this Kennedy-Von Hollen bill about?**

Congress established the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to inspect audits of public companies. Currently, **Chinese government refuses to allow the PCAOB to inspect audits of companies registered in China and Hong Kong**. The Kennedy-Von Hollen bill aims to prohibit securities of a company from being listed on any of the U.S. securities exchanges if the company has failed to comply with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Boards (PCAOB) audits for three years in a row.

**Source**: Government website [https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2020/12/house-passes-kennedy-van-hollen-bill-to-protect-americans-from-fraudulent-foreign-companies](https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2020/12/house-passes-kennedy-van-hollen-bill-to-protect-americans-from-fraudulent-foreign-companies)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 1: This bill does not apply to companies like $BABA or $NIO, because they are already using American auditors.**

**BUSTED**. For example, $NIO uses PricewaterhouseCoopers **Zhong Tian LLP**, which is a **China-based** auditor. **PCAOB currently CANNOT inspect audits from $NIO, or $BABA, or many other Chinese companies**. 

**Source**: the **official PCAOB website** where you can find that $NIO is listed as a DENIED ISSUER AUDIT CLIENT

[https://pcaobus.org/oversight/international/denied-access-to-inspections?searchWithin=NIO](https://pcaobus.org/oversight/international/denied-access-to-inspections?searchWithin=NIO) 

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 2: PricewaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian LLP is registered with PCAOB. This means PCAOB is able to inspect $NIOs audits.**

**BUSTED**. An accounting firm being registered with PCAOB **does NOT mean its audits can be inspected**. (To be honest I am quite surprised the internet trolls can dig this far in order to twist facts. They even know the firm is registered. Wow.)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 3: Whether Trump signs this bill or not does not matter at all, because he will soon leave the White House.**

**BUSTED**. Trump is still the president. After the bill passes both Senate and House, **if president signs, the bill becomes a legislation and will be enforced**. Unless this bill gets repealed after Biden takes over, it will have a lasting impact. And since this bill has gained **unanimous bipartisan support**, it is highly unlikely that the bill will be repealed.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 4: Because Trumps TikTok ban hasnt been successful so far, the Chinese stock delisting bill will not be enforced either.**

**BUSTED**. These are totally different matters. Trumps TikTok ban is an **executive order**, **not a law**. Executive orders can be overturned by judges. Whereas, if the Kennedy-Von Hollen bill is signed by Trump, will be become **legislation**.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 5: This bill is fake, because it is passed by Senate first and House second. Real bills get passed in House first.**

**BUSTED**. God, I am so disappointed in the new generations understanding of our own government. **Senate bill, proposed by senators, will be voted in the Senate first**. And since this bill is proposed by Senator John Kennedy and Senator Chris Van Hollen, this is a Senate bill. (As an American citizen, **please try to understand how our own government works**)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 6: $NIO spokeswoman says they have become compliant over the past few months, which means $NIO will not be subject to this bill.**

**PROBABLY INACCURATE**. They can only **TRY** to comply with the regulations, but whether they **CAN** is **not really up to them**. **It is NOT the companies themselves that are against the inspection of audits, it is the Chinese government.** 

**Source**: the damn SEC chairman Jay Clayton himself [https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-vital-role-audit-quality-and-regulatory-access-audit-and-other](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-vital-role-audit-quality-and-regulatory-access-audit-and-other)

**Chinas state security laws are invoked** at times to limit U.S. regulators ability to oversee the financial reporting of U.S.-listed, China-based companies. In particular, **Chinese laws governing the protection of state secrets and national security have been invoked to limit foreign access to China-based business books and records and audit work papers**.

It is outside companies power to comply with US regulations, because the issue concerns Chinese state security law. **You think these companies will disobey Chinese state security laws just to comply with US listing rules?** If the Chinese government says No, there will be no way they can be compliant, no matter how they **TRY**.

**Source**: another Chinese EV maker $LI even mentioned such uncertainty in its SEC filing.

the adoption of any rules, legislations or other efforts to increase U.S. regulatory access to audit information could cause uncertainty, and **we could be delisted if we are unable to meet the PCAOB inspection requirement in time**

They may not, but they **COULD**.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 7: The Chinese will make compromise to avoid delisting, because they are weaklings and they always make concessions to the US.**

**UNCERTAIN**. I cant imagine how people can just go around vouching this as a fact. Do they work for the Chinese government? Are they the officials responsible for the negotiations? How can this be a certainty already?

If you bet that the Chinese will make compromises, **you are basically betting that Chinese will back down from its own state security law**. **It is possible that they will, but its far from certainty**. They have not compromised on an independent investigation of coronavirus origin in Wuhan. They have not compromised on the National Security Law enacted in Hong Kong. How on earth can you be so sure that they will compromise on their own state security law? 

The negotiation on PCAOB inspection between the US and China has taken 10 years. China has not yet compromised in the past 10 years. But now suddenly they will just yield? Is this really logical thinking, or **purely your imagination?**

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

Can these Chinese stocks go up? Not impossible. Can they go down? Also possible. Whether you buy or sell, consider the risks, and **dont get manipulated by those who are spreading lies for their own benefit.**

Title: Stop buying PLTR shares retards, sell PLTR CSP LEAPS instead
The whole point of PLTR is that it's a great company that has a solid business for the future, but it's highly overvalued at the moment. Serious analysts put price targets at 12$. 

So instead of buying at 22$ something that you know is bound to correct, sell a cash secured put

Look at the options for PLTR expiring January 2022. The 12.5$ strike has a 2.95$ premium. For each contract you sell you receive 295$ and you have to put out 1250$ as collateral. 
That is a FUCKING 23.6% yearly return on investment for god's sake, much better than most people that hang out here can get. This is a safe 23% heaven and most of you will likely lose money anyway yoloing on FDs. Yolo on this instead. This high IV opportunity won't last forever.

And if the stock actually plummets towards 12.5$ you chill out because your breakeven is at 9.55$, which means if you get assigned during the year you are buying a great company to hold long term at a great price.

Thank me later.

Title: The catalysts for - NNOX
Nanox (Ticker Symbol - NNOX) is a medical imaging company that seeks to revolutionize radiographic imaging: something that has NOT been done for about 100 years!  


**SHORT DD:**

\*\*Company has huge partnerships:  
\-SK Telecom   
\-Foxcon  
\-Fuji film  
\-many other richturds

\*\*Share price is currently at $61 AH. Ramped up significantly going into tomorrow's HUGE catalyst event.   


\*\*I'm not going to go all nerdy on you turds any further.   
All you need to know are the catalysts that can absolutely moon this stock:  


1. TOMORROW: **Thursday December 3rd 2020 (11:30am EST)** \- Live demo of the Nano-X Arc at the Radiology Society of North America 2020 virtual conference. This demo is going to destroy Citron's fruity ass short claims (Reference all the companies that Citron shorted. Yeah... they're stupid.)
2. Can Happen at ANY moment - FDA 510(K) application in for a single-source device which could get approved ***before*** 1H 2021.
3. Mid-year 2021 - FDA 510(K) approval of the multi-source device, the one planned on being commercialized. This one is the bigger deal and is needed to drive revenue.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You might be thinking: "Is this a 'sell the news' type event?"  
Answer: Yes and no.  
There are those that front-ran this stock's price action leading up to this event because they know how powerful of a catalyst this event can be. They will undoubtedly sell to secure profits AND to hedge themselves against the possibility that the demo fails (for whatever reason... HIGHLY DOUBTFUL btw).

But here's the kicker: if this event demo proves this company's technology - this will change the game of radiographic imaging as we know it.   
**In other words:** *Every* clinic and hospital in the *entire* world will want to get their hands on this revolutionary technology. And I'm not just talking about purely MD clinics. As a physical therapist myself, I'm talking about potentially utilizing this kind of imaging in our own outpatient clinics! (NO NEED for us to refer out to more expensive radiographic imaging clinics)  
The possibilities are endless.

&amp;#x200B;

Positions: Been in since $34/share after a week of IPO, went through the whole Citron dump back down to IPO price and now... sitting more in options. 70c 12/18/20.

Get in first thing tomorrow AM. Print tendies tomorrow in the afternoon. You're welcome.  
Godspeed fellow turds.  
Oh yeah. Citron is retarded. Every stock they've ever shorted has ballooned. I can almost guarantee they are low-key long on this company. They just wanted to get in after they shorted the fk out of it.

Title: PLTR - Actual Solid DD-
PLTR is about to be the world's biggest peanut supplier. Planters isn't just into nuts like peanut, cashews, and pecans. They're in the dried fruit game as well since a few years back.

Snacking and eating junk food is at an all time high because of the Covid lockdowns. I don't think is fully priced in yet. And I think that's why lots of institutions are starting to pile in.

George Soros thinks this practice is unethical for mom and pops farmers who don't have a marketing budget to compete with Mr. Peanut's iconic monocle and cane.

Also it is more profitable for farmers to sell to Planters than it is for them to sell to a wholesaler making them susceptible to anti trust regulations.

Planters is educating farmers on environmentally sustainable farming earning them carbon credits similar to how Tesla operated for a long time.

PLTR is now focused less on manufacturing. They are focused more on logistics, price control, and setting supply and demand. You could call them one of the largest tech ventures to come out of 2020.

Pick up those PLTR calls and shares. But remember not to load up on weeklies. They're too risky right now.

Title: Autistic Due Diligence: OTRK and retire by Christmas
&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0ybsoqsjgw261.jpg?width=578&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a310e11dec6354e5d6cfeb19a3eccf46806751d7

  

Welcome to December you collection of degenerate fucks. 

First, I would like to take a moment of silence for our wounded PLTR soldiers, the boomers might have taken a lead, but the war is not over. No, no it isn't.

Instead it has become clear that $PLTR (**P**lanetary **L**andform **T**rajectory **R**ealized      ) is simply playing with her dinner (boomers) tenderizing their meat for a more savory meal. 

And as much as I enjoy this inevitable victory, I must confess, I prefer to win with dignity - and so I present to you **$OTRK**

OTRK is the most undervalued telehealth stock, period. With a telehealth focus on mental health, it will serve not only to channel our mania from nauseating gains, but relieve the stress and PTSD boomers feel from their margin calls and vaporizing 401Ks. 

But here is your ADD (Autistic Due Diligence):

OTRK had revenue growth of 180% this year, projected 100% revenue growth next year, and the company has indicated that COVID has SLOWED business, meaning vaccine news from you MRNA pumpers is also good for OTRK.

OTRK uses their AI to identify those at risk (butthurt boomers) and offer services from there. They are to mental health what LVGO was to diabeetus.

They have recently signed a deal with the VA system to serve our vets (thank you for your service).

On a price to sales basis, their P/S ratio is around 12, yet their growth is &gt;100%. Growth stocks usually get a higher PS ratio because they are growing. Even if you undervalue them compared to TDOC (PS 17) and AMWL (PS 26), OTRKs PS ratio of 12 is crazy low. LVGO had a PS of 40 before acquisition by TDOC FWIW.

But, how will this make me money you ask? Here's the glorious part:

OTRK has an incredibly low float of only 8M shares. You read that right - 8 million shares is all there is. Of that, \~30% is held by institutions, and percent of float short is 35%. This means that with some buying demand, it has the potential to ROCKET vertically upwards.

You bunch of degenerate fucks were able to pump PLTR volume by more than 60mil shares/day on a 500mil share float - do this to OTRK as we can retire by Christmas. 

TLDR: OTRK is the autistic ride to the moon.

Title: DBX DD
Listen up retards, I know what it seems like. A good company for once? not a meme stock? Well, I'm sure you guys will change that

Let me introduce you guys to Dropbox (ticker DBX).

Dropbox is a Cloud computing company with a market cap of 8.2 billion, meaning it's a small cap growth company. We all use cloud, the need for cloud is consistently rising day over day. The need for Cloud is not going away, so what makes Dropbox a buy over the other cloud computing companies?

1. It has a fantastic PE for a growth company. Yes, PE is not the end all be all, but with a forward PE of 19.42 as a growth stock in a hot sector, that is disgustingly undervalued. 
2. It's branding. Their branding and whole repertoire is centralized around small/midsize businesses. It shows the simplicity of using a cloud product. It's becoming a smart workspace in workspaces and schools alike. It is pretty much the only cloud computing company advertising to such. But don't let that make you think they aren't looking big picture, especially their CEO.
3. Their E signing of documents. If you retards think for a second that within the next 5-10 years all signings of documents wont be electronically, then your out of your mind. DBX is one of the few companies in the cloud computing sector doing this too.
4. Their shift in focus. They have started also focusing on the idea of a at home workspace, which I personally love. Although offices and workspaces alike will always love to unnecessarily bring people in just for the purpose of micromanagement, but this pandemic only showed that working from home is the future. I know many of my IC associates have said they will be doing their walkthroughs and meetings through zoom for the benefits. 
5. Their CEO. Drew Houston has been making some moves. He left a busy California city to move to Houston. This move is good for the future of the company, trying to focus on the vision instead of doing business-esch things. 
6. Not a speculative stock. It has beat on earnings for almost every single earnings report and it's revenue has been going up consistently for years. Analyst price targets are also very bullish, with the median prediction being +45% for the next 12 months. They are sitting on over 1.2 Billion dollars of cash, 50 grand is really nothing to a motherfucker like Dropbox. The only speculative thing I can find is that stock twits is outrageously bullish.

TLDR: Jan 2022/2023 calls/boring old shares

Title: California lockdown tomorrow or Friday = AMZN tendiessss
I have a certain level of confidence that Governor Newsom is going to issue a renewed Shelter in Place order by end of this week.

Covid stocks going to get a bump. Including e-commerce companies, because where Californians (or other states...) may have done Christmas shopping online before, they definitely will now. Guess what, everyone will use Amazon. Double guess what, theyre going to shop in early December to avoid shipping delays.

Im eyeing 3620c Feb 19. AMZN already trading lower than its worth... I spy a catalyst.

The thing is I blew up my account with PLTR and BABA calls, which I cant sell rn. No capital left to play with. So this retard needs some retarded funding to get my wife back home from her boyfriends house for the holidays.

$8k for one of these contracts, $40k for 5. I will use funds to make the play and donate 50% of tendies to the local high school to better fund remote learning. paypal.me/brokefomo 

Honestly, hope this info makes people some money. Merry Christmas.

Cheers,
Your Neighborhood Retard

TLDR is the first sentence, you fucking imbecile

Title: Kohls (KSS) gonna blow up soon!
Ive been considering what my plays are going to be going into 2021 and did some research on Kohls (KSS).  I think Kohls is going to see strong growth in 2021 and will net any investors a nice return for a few reasons:

1) Sephora:  Stock jumped this week due to a partnership between Sephora and Kohls.  Sephora will install 850 store-in-stores, with 200 stores coming in 2021z

2) COVID:  54% of people say they have gained weight during restrictions as a result of Covid.  As vaccines roll-out later this year/early 2021 we should begin seeing more people getting back to work and traveling.  The combination of different body shapes and getting back to work will be resulting in an increase of softline (clothing) sales.  

3) Financials:  Despite a decrease in revenue in 2020, cash on hand has increased to $2.4 billion and total assets to $15 billion. They remain strong and wont be on the brink of bankruptcy in the next few months. 


With an all-time-high of $82.05 (September 2018) and a current price of $38.55, in opening April 2021 $47.50 calls tomorrow.

Title: TSLA to the moon 
https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=17675872

Goldman Sachs Upgrades Tesla (TSLA) to Buy, PT to $780 on Improved LT Sales Outlook and Margin Expansion.

I saw a post someone was asking unusual call buying activity this might be the reason.

Title: BBBY: Another fat girl ready for a short squeeze
We're autists; we all love the same [type](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9kaqeh/this_guy_knows_about_long_term_investments/). Now BBBY, she not as thicc as GME of course, but she got similar perks.

**1) Fine Fundamentals**  
-Bigly earnings beat due to [e-commerce](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/01/bed-bath-beyond-bbby-reports-fiscal-q2-2020-earnings.html). No longer the Blood Bath and Beyond that we used to know it as.

**2) Tempting Technicals**  
-Bullish pennant after the earnings gap up.  
-Declining volume signaling bullish consolidation.  
-Valid [Andrew's pitchfork](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/05/andrewspitchfork.asp) meaning price has 80% chance of reaching the pitchfork's median line.    
-Breakout could bring price to $33 by mid Jan.  
[Chart](https://imgur.com/a/q5qcCn7)

**3) Sexy Short Squeeze**  
-One of the most heavily shorted stonks on the market [@ 55.63% of float](https://imgur.com/a/qgASlEI).  
-GME is around twice that: so GME squeeze would be like Ragnarok on Beargard, while BBBY squeeze would be like Mt. Vesuvius on Bearpeii - both explosive.

**TLDR; Keeping buying/holding GME or BBBY $30C 1/21/2021 if you have spare change.**

Title: Will Garmins Autoland make it the Tesla of aviation? (NASD: GRMN)
Will Garmins Autoland make it the Tesla of aviation? (NASD: GRMN) 

#**Sector and Industry**

Garmin Ltd. operates in the technology sector under the scientific &amp; technical instruments industry. The industry has seen [appreciated 21.33%](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&amp;v=120&amp;o=name) in the past year. Garmin has slightly outperformed this growth with [23.61% share price appreciation]( https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRMN) in the past year. Annual industry earnings growth is [at 7.22% for the last five years]( https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&amp;v=120&amp;o=name) with Garmin significantly outperforming at [21.60% in the same time period](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRMN).

Garmin is the [second largest scientific &amp; technical instruments company](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=121&amp;f=ind_scientifictechnicalinstruments&amp;o=-marketcap) by market cap, second only to [Fortive Corporation](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FTV). GRMNs market cap [currently sits at $22.78B]( https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRMN). Garmin makes up around 14% of the industrys [$168.06B total market cap](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&amp;v=120&amp;o=name).

#**The Company**

Garmin Ltd. offers products in [five main categories](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRMN/profile?p=GRMN): automotive, aviation, marine, outdoor, and fitness. In 2019, revenues were split between the segments as follows:

Segment|Revenue
:--|:--
Fitness|28%
Outdoor|24%
Aviation|20%
Auto|15%
Marine|13%

The COVID-19 pandemic was a positive catalyst in Garmins marine, outdoor, and fitness categories. Overall, the Company experience a 19% increase in third quarter 2020 revenue, quarter-over-quarter. This is exceptional growth, especially considering Garmins exposure to aviation.

As of the Companys [third quarter 2020 earnings call](https://www8.garmin.com/aboutGarmin/invRelations/reports/2020_Q3_Earnings_Call_Transcript.pdf), marine revenues increased 54% quarter-over-quarter on increased consumer interest in boating and fishing. Garmins fitness segment saw a 35% increase in revenue from its wearable and cycling products. Notable, Garmin recently launched the [Venu Sq smartwatch](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/707174). The Companys outdoor segment saw revenue increases of 30% with strong sales increases for the [adventure watches](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/outdoor_recreation/adventure-watches/c12520-c16900-p1.html) product line.

Garmin did see decreased revenues it its automotive and aviation operations due to the affects of COVID-19. Automotive revenues decreased 6% in third quarter 2020, compared with the same quarter in 2019. The Company has introduced several exciting new automotive products, including Garmin Catalyst: [an industry first real-time coaching tool designed to optimize track racing performance](https://www8.garmin.com/aboutGarmin/invRelations/reports/2020_Q3_Earnings_Call_Transcript.pdf). In the same quarter, the Company became a Tier 1 supplier for BMW automobiles.

The Companys aviation segment suffered revenue decreases of 19% due to COVID-19. The Company does not manufacture or sell aircraft itself. However, Garmin does expect aviation sales to fall a further 17%. Increases in owner flown aircraft will help to mitigate some losses. One of Garmins most exciting products in the segment is its Autoland technology.

#**Autoland**

Garmins Autoland is [taking the next step towards autonomous flight](https://www.avweb.com/aviation-news/garmin-autoland-approved-in-cirrus-vision-jet/) by allowing aircraft to be autonomously landed through a single button press. The Autoland system considers environmental factors, chooses a viable airport, communicates with ATC, and then lands the aircraft on an available runwayall while providing updates to passengers. These updates include location, fuel, destination airport, and arrival time. Garmins research into autonomous landing may remind investors of Tesla, which is developing self-driving capabilities. Garmins Autoland should not be underestimatedit could become the base for full autonomous flight.

Autoland can only currently be used in emergency situations where the pilot is not capable of landing the aircraft. Autoland directs the aircraft to a suitable airport nearby for landing based upon a variety of conditions, including, but not limited to, weather, terrain, approach, runway and aircraft suitability.
In third quarter 2020, the FAA certified Autoland for [use on the Cirrus Vision Jet](https://www.avweb.com/aviation-news/garmin-autoland-approved-in-cirrus-vision-jet/), adding to its previous certifications for the Piper M600 and Daher TBM 940.

I spoke with a pilot regarding the Autoland technology. He expects Garmin's new automatic landing systems will be found in most general aviation TAAs [technically advanced aircraft], in the next decade. Many pilots around the world share that sentiment, especially during a time of great advancements in autonomous vehicles.

#**Valuation**

Year|Revenue*|EBITDA*|FCF*
:--|:--|:--|:--
2016|$3,018,665|$741,900|$705,682
2017|$3,087,004|$777,691|$660,842
2018|$3,347,444|$882,153|$919,520
2019|$3,757,505|$1,068,560|$698,549

*In thousands of USD; from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRMN/financials?p=GRMN).

Garmin has seen consistent revenue growth in the past five years but the earnings growth is even more impressive at [21.60% annual EPS growth](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=grmn). The Companys consistent EPS growth is indicative of its quality management and sustainability. The earnings growth has been priced into the share price at a [PEG of 3.23](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRMN/key-statistics?p=GRMN). It should also be noted that free cash flows have fallen year-over-year amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Company remains fiscally healthy with [just $58.42M in debt and cash of $1.65B](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRMN/key-statistics?p=GRMN).

Ticker|GRMN
:--|:--
Price|$118.48
Market Cap|$22.78B
P/E|22.51
PEG|3.23
P/S|5.70
Dividend|2.04%

Still, the Company is fundamentally solid and will likely continue to grow. Garmin currently pays a [dividend of $2.44 per share, which is 2.04% of its share price](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=grmn). The Company has increased its dividend payout in the [past eight consecutive years](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GRMN/garmin/dividend-yield-history); this makes it a good candidate for dividend growth investors. Garmin will become a dividend champion in the likely case that its payout increases the next two years.

#**Conclusion**

Garmin has seen immense growth in its marine, outdoor, and fitness segments. The Companys investments in its Autoland product have put it at the forefront of autonomous flying. Garmin is a clear innovator in its industry and will likely continue to outperform the overall market.

I personally believe Garmins investments in autonomous flight will make it a leader in the industry, much like Tesla has become in automotive self-driving.

Title: $YY = TikTok + OnlyFans
Greetings fellow autists. Y'all remember Marie Kondo? Japanese woman that gets off to cleaning people's shit up for them? Only keep things that spark joy? Fuck yeah. Well, with all you retards losing money by being balls long PLTR, I figured it was time to help you Marie Kondo your own portfolio. Let's tidy that shit up and spark some fucking Joyy.

Yes I spelled Joyy with two y's. And no big brain, that wasn't a typo. **Joyy ($YY) is your next one-way ticket to the goddamn moon.** Can you do basic math? Great. Neither can I. Do you get slightly aroused at the mere sight of a woman with a pulse? Of course you do. I myself just went six to midnight typing that out. Do you like losing money in the stonk market? Clearly. But I'm here to try to change that.

Congrats on making it this far. Let's get started!

$YY is the largest live-streaming platform you've never heard of. **It's like if TikTok merged with OnlyFans and was a publicly traded stonk**. I'll wait while you buy a few shares on that premise alone.

But it gets better. Much better. Joyy operates two live-streaming services, one is called YY Live and its getting sold to Baidu for $3.6bn. **The other is called Bigo Live and it's one of the top 10 apps in the world with revenues growing more than 130% y/y.** Many of the videos on Bigo are of hot Asian women live-streaming themselves dancing. Nice.

That's still not even the best part though. Galaxy brain question: would you rather pay full price for something or get something at a discount? What if you could get it for close to free? Well, at YY's current price, you're nearly getting Bigo Live for free. Please consult a doctor if you have an erection lasting for more than four hours.

How can that be? This part requires some remedial math skills that you and I both don't have, but alas, we must soldier on.

YY currently has $2.8bn in net cash on their balance sheet. Woah! I didn't know this was a fucking advanced accounting class. Well it is. Stay with me. We also know YY is going to get $3.6bn in cash from Baidu for the sale of YY Live. Lastly, YY is an investor in a company called HUYA that is valued at $750mm.

So... $2.8bn plus $3.6bn plus $750mm is? No, not $420.69 you retard. Try again. It's $7.1bn. Feel free to sit down and drink a sip of water if your head is spinning from all these numbers.

Compare this $7.1bn to YY's current market cap of $7.8bn. $7.8bn minus $7.1bn for everything that isn't Bigo Live is $600mm. There you have it. That's the implied value the market is giving to Bigo Live.

Holy shit right? To quote the great David Byrne from Talking Heads: [you may ask yourself](https://youtu.be/5IsSpAOD6K8?t=69)...

* Didn't Baidu just pay $3.6bn for YY Live?
* And isn't Bigo Live growing 130%+ while YY Live is barely growing?
* And aren't Bigo Live and YY Live about the same size at $1.8bn in revenues?
* And finally  you may ask yourself  if Baidu is willing to pay $3.6bn for YY Live, shouldn't Bigo Live be valued way the fuck more than that?

**The answer to all of these questions is fuck yes.** Bigo Live should be valued way higher than $600mm but you retards are too busy jacking off and losing money on PLTR to figure it out.

**The other great part about YY is we get to fuck some bears on our way to the moon**. I cannot expressly condone nor condemn the actual fucking of bears, but I can condone the fucking of some short sellers. Muddy Waters just released a short report on Joyy and short sellers piled in like the dumbass lemmings they are. How did YY respond to the short report you may ask? **By giving MW the double middle finger and increasing their dividend by $200mm.** Do frauds usually do that? Hell no they don't.

That's how you fucking spark Joyy in your portfolio!

Title: $Yalla - Stay away!
I live in Dubai and never heard of $Yalla - did some research and its a cayman registered Chinese company that pretends to be dubai based. They have a 2 man office here with unknown management and nobody has ever heard of the company - no VCs or private equity groups. They claim to be the middle easts tencent but nobody in the region knows wtf it is.

**SMDDIC**

\+Q4: revenue expected to increase double digits (QoQ) as demand &gt; supply. Issue: capacity shortage which may not be resolved for a while.

\+Expected to gain market share in 2020 &amp; 2021

\+Company's smartphone TDDI revenue is projected to have a nice double digit increase in Q4

\-Traditional display driver ICs for smartphone after spiking Q3 is set to decline double digit in Q4.

?Company highly invested in AMOLED technology and believes it will be a huge growth engine for SMDDIC business in 2021.

\+Tablet TDDI is ballin'. Increase of up to 80% (QoQ) expected for Q4. Believe it is a tremendous upside as Himax is a leading supplier for all major Android names.

\-Expected decline for tradition tablets QoQ, but still better than YoY previous numbers.

\+Car Panel Driver ICs hit hard by COVID, but recovering as car sales come back. Important to note: Much bigger gross margins on these and gradually bouncing back. More of these new technologies in place for 2021.

**Non-Driver Product Categories**

**WLO**

\+Still enaging and developing future generation products (ToF 3D sensing, waveguide for AR goggles, biomedical devices, and others)

**3D Sensing**

\+Targeting next gen Android phones

\+Few design wins from China's e-payment market actually, with shipments already starting in Q4

\+Working with customers for industrial robotics, smart door lock and home security, also.

**Ultralow power smart sensing**

\+Himax sees this as huge potential for the total package they hope to offer in the future. Just read the financial report because I'm getting lazy here

**CMOS Image Sensor**

\-Bad capped by foundry shortage, more when this shit ain't happening or gets better, chief

**\[Himax\] Future Guidance (Q4 2020):**

**IFRS Profit**: To be around 15.0 cents to 16.0 cents per diluted ADS

**Non-IFRS Profit** (1): To be around 15.1 cents to 16.1 cents per diluted ADS

Title: $RKT is gonna moon again soon
Remember $RKT? It had good earnings but did nothing. Welp, now it is about to do well. The post-earnings run is about to begin. 

Remember what Cramer said? It is a very well-run company + low-interest rates, an exodus of people to the suburbs and a Joe Biden win. Biden won, and the stock has been consolidating for 3 months since yall pumped it in August. 

Yeah it went down on earnings, but it did beat, and revenue was up 163% year-over-year. The CEO said, "Rocket Companies assisted more clients in the third quarter of 2020 than any quarter in our 35-year history". Oh, and they also announced a share buyback program after earnings. 

Add those numbers from their earnings, along with everything Cramer said and $RKT is very well positioned right now. Its chart is also textbook. 

On the [chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/TGs2i7il/), RKT has an inverse head and shoulders formation with lots of consolidation over the past 3 months. It is at $20 right now, the low of this consolidation + running up against a trendline from its ATH. 


Buying some January and March calls here. Possible move into the $30s by the end of January.
   - January '21 $30 Calls for 0.33
   - January '21 $20 Calls for 2.00
   - March '21 $30 Calls for 1.10
   - March '21 $24 Calls for 2.00


this is an updated post from earlier in the day with some more information.

Title: Meme stocks are moving in opposite directions from the overall market even if they are from completely different industries over the past two days. IMO, its because their valuations are a hype driven house of cards.


Title: Walmart Is The Future
Buy Walmart!
Trust me, You dont want to miss out


Overall:
Walmarts new online Walmart plus service is very enticing and costs little to run compared to Amazon. They could become the future Amazon if the amount of people with Walmart Plus continues to grow. They should make a lot of money online during the Christmas season and pandemic and you should expect very high earnings going forward.

Walmart is making a push into the pharmaceutical sector, investing money into the space. They also announced a healthcare/ health insurance 
program recently. Health is an area of huge potential due to the Pandemic causing focus on the health sector.

Walmart is the largest retail store but was not affected to badly by the pandemic. Since they are the largest retail store you can except the stock to rise after the current restrictions on retail stores are lifted without having to worry about it falling with bad pandemic news.

Walmart is:
- A new online retailer with huge potential 

- Growing in the healthcare and Pharmaceutical industries

-Set up to make money distributing COVID vaccines

- The largest physical retail company in the world. (Physical retail is a sector that goes up a lot with good pandemic news)

These types of stocks are all stocks that people look at to find huge potential in growth. Walmart is really innovating and putting themselves in a position to grow a lot as a company over the next few years. Theres a chance that they will become the world largest online retailer and worlds largest Pharmacy along with them being the worlds largest physical retail company. That might seem ridiculous but it is entirely possible. If you think this is bullshit I encourage you to read the three news articles below and my in depth analysis of the stock.





Thing to read (references and todays news):

1. 
[Understanding Walmart Plus](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joannasciarrino/2020/09/15/walmart-plus-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-walmart-delivery-service/?sh=2acacc8b1085)

[Walmart Pharmacy New EVP And Plan](https://www.grocerydive.com/news/walmart-names-evp-of-health-and-wellness/591437/)

[Walmart Opening Pharmacies](https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-investing/articles/walmart-to-open-health-superstores-what-it-means-for-real-estate-investors/)



My Findings:

1. 
Walmart is really pushing their new online store service Walmart Plus. Walmart Plus is like Amazon prime except Walmart Plus offers same day or next day shipping for free on any purchase and same day free grocery delivery. They are one of the only companies in the world that can do this because of their nationwide retail stores. Walmart retail stores near almost every town which allows for the faster delivery than Amazon. This faster delivery will entice people to join Walmart plus and gives them an advantage over Amazon. Faster delivery allows for them to ship perishable goods like groceries because they will stay fresh during the same day shipping. Walmart also can keep costs at a minimum for the service. Unlike Amazon they do not need to pay for huge warehouses and warehouse employees because they have many stores already established. Amazon also has to ship your products across the country first in a semi truck to a warehouse, then from the warehouse onto a separate delivery truck that goes to your house. Amazon has to pay Warehouse costs which include property taxes, upkeep, and the huge initial cost to open a warehouse. They also have to pay employees at the warehouses. They also have to pay for semi trucks, last mile delivery vans and the salaries of the employees driving them (or pay for a service like UPS).
Keep in mind Amazon has become one of the largest companies in the world. Walmart offers faster delivery while avoiding the fees for warehouses (they use their stores instead). They also have much lower costs on delivery. (They ship your products straight from your local Walmart to your house). If Amazon has become one of the top 5 companies in the world imagine the money Walmart will make by offering a similar service with faster deliveries with much less operating cost. With the bump in online sales during the Christmas season, and people turning to online shopping, Walmart can expect to gain a lot of new users on its new Walmart Plus service. This makes Walmart a strong growth tech stock that could become the next Amazon.

2. Walmart is making big moves in the pharmaceutical space. They are opening more pharmacies and putting money into their pharmaceutical programs Walmart announced a new Health and Wellness EVP Dr. Cheryl Pegus, the former Chief medical officer of Walgreens. They should be able to make easy money with covid vaccine distribution and start making more in the pharmaceutical space overall. They are looking to take over CVS as the largest pharmacy In America. (They are currently the second largest) Walmart also started a healthcare program looking to capitalize on the health insurance market and take some of the market from companies like blue cross. They are looking to combine their new ventures into health with Walmart Plus and roll out a program to deliver perceptions to your home. There are rumors Walmart could even be able to deliver covid vaccines to homes once they are available. Take that with a grain of salt as it has not yet been confirmed by Walmart.


3. Walmart is the worlds largest retail chain. You would think that that they should have taken a huge hit with the pandemic like most other retail stores. They did not however and actually reported a 6% average grown in overall sales at retail stores. This is due to Walmart being an essential business because they sell groceries and other essential items. People still shopped at Walmart even with the pandemic going on which makes them a very stable stock. Just because they didnt go down with covid does not mean they wont go up when it goes away. I expect large gains in the stock once the pandemic is over. 



That took hours to write so I would appreciate it if you gave it an upvote and commented your thoughts :)

Title: Shorting peloton you autist. It is time... and it is the way.
The hypothesis is Peloton is the next weworks when it explodes.  

Recently put on a 10k position and will increase it to 20k if it goes against me around $130-135 stock price., and Ill unload another 10k at 145-150. as my final bullet if it becomes a disaster.  I own put leaps at 65, 75, 85 strike prices. Jan 2021.  

\-----Currently the stay at home, the pandemic is a big boost to their business.  As gyms open up, people will go to gyms I know I will. 

\-There are tons of competitors that do the same thing.  Nortic track is their biggest competitor.  there value 7 billion . peloton is 30 billion.  There is little to no differentiation. peloton is 4x their competitor.  NordicTrack is also trying to IPO also, so either nordic track is going to go up to the moon and catch up to peloton, or peloton is going to crash.  or have some consolidation regardless

\-if you go on Facebook right now on buy/sell pelotons, you can get pelotons half off right now from all the impulse buyers of their product. that have buyers remorse.  

Feel free to join in the trade.  I know you autistc people like to gamble.  Its time to send the peloton to the ground. I imagine the stock should be around 40-50 dollars realistically.

https://preview.redd.it/cpluqdzw9u261.png?width=1662&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f568389237cad8dfa7740b67e73a66117a7d30b

I've got a bit of extra time over the next few weeks, so I decided I'd do some more analysis into discussion on /r/WallStreetBets. I'll be giving updates as I get deeper into the statistical analysis, but I wanted to share a preliminary visualization I did of the number of uses of the word "YOLO" in "Tomorrow's" moves thread alongside the $SPY.

Obviously, the increasing YOLOs over time is strongly influenced by the growing popularity of WSB, and one of the next things I'll be doing is normalizing the YOLOs by the total number of comments.

Let me know if you have any thoughts or suggestions on where to go with the analysis. After normalizing and creating a "desperation factor", I'd like to backtest a trading strategy around this data point and the sentiment data that I've already been collecting.

Title: Dish hopefully loses 160+ channels tonight.
DISH a satellite TV provider. They are up 42% this last month to $36.89. Today their contract expires with Nextar. They have been negotiating and claim Nextar is the devil and is raising prices too high. This could cause exponential customer loss, stock plummet.

&amp;#x200B;

Dish also got into a bidding war and overpaid for SPECTRUM wireless contracts they spent roughly 20 bn to aquire. This was earlier in the decade. However, the time is running out and they have yet to produce the build-out requirements for these by the FCC. The march 2020 deadline already passed and the next step is them failing to meet the 2023 deadline. They will face a 72 million dollar penalty should they fail.

&amp;#x200B;

The bull case here is that sprint and t-mobile merger failed and that Dish received an upgrade to Buy by some analysis because they predict Verizon may want to purchase these contracts for their network so that t-mobile does not obtain it.

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory, I work for Dish and they are horrible. Dish loses 671K customers annually. Currently with somewhere around 13.9 million. They also own Sling TV which is terrible and loses large amounts annually. The representatives that enter your home are micromanged into selling a minimum of $34 a job of upcharges on anything from HDMI Cables to full sound systems or smart home devices.

&amp;#x200B;

Dish has cut a huge amount of internal and external workforce this year amongst COVID-19 as well as raising the requirements for technicians to sell more. COVID may have brought in more temporary customers but with this blackout and more annual customer loss than their competitors I see this a potential shockwave into bear territory for the company if they fail to make a deal.

Something to keep an eye on, I would absolutely love to throw some PUTS on this one.

Title: FUBO - Credible source says football season has been a tidal wave of subscribers. Heres why.
I wish I would have seen this perfect storm a month ago, but it wasnt until I saw a post here that I thought to dig into this stock a little more. Here are the five things that are leading to this incredible surge.

1 - FUBO skews towards live sports household as the best vale streaming service for everything sports. Football season is huge for them every year. RedZone, all the games anywhere, anytime. (Obvious)

2 - With Covid-19, it appears less people are going to bars, going to games, and going to friends houses to watch. Now that everyone is staying at home, people are finally forking over $70/mo. to get access to 10 game simulcast experience they had pre-Covid. (Interesting)

3 - Draft Kings and Fan Duel fanatics are flocking to this service. Gambling addicts (probably a bunch of people on this sub), are lighting this company up (fascinating)

Im convinced this wont stay a secret for much longer and you will see a massive rally up earnings. Price will double in the next two weeks.

Title: Nikola is still going to tank
People that bought puts are freaking out because Nikola rose 4% today. GM obviously saw nothing in this company so it made a tiny deal that literally has no risk on the automotive giant. Yes, Nikola could potentially turn into something real with its new leadership, but its market cap is still 6.88 BILLION FUCKING DOLLARS. Trevor Milton is a god for creating so much hype around nothing. I took todays green day as an opportunity to gamble with some $17.5 p 12/4. Yes, the company is not dead yet, but it is about as valuable as my public hair Etsy business

Title: The Gang Takes on Nat Gas
I would like to dedicate this research to the oil trader that made a bill shorting Nat Gas after a hurricane and the kid in my stats class for igniting this idea.

Alright, listen up Fireman, Austismos, Goons, Gigolos, and Spooks alike we are taking on the Global Energy markets today. Skip to comments for TLDR. Our emphasis will be on how US Homes are heated. With patriotism and pandemic numbers in full swing, President-Elect Biden may attempt to slow the US Economy, pushing families into homes. Dont debate this in the comments, debate if your local sheriffs department has the funding and resources, and willingness to uphold this.

Lets begin at your new favorite three-letter agency EIA; our journey with understanding and defining how the U.S. Energy Information Administration defines what makes up our statistics.

* **Residential** sector includes homes and apartments.
* **Commercial** sector includes offices, malls, stores, schools, hospitals, hotels, warehouses, restaurants, and places of worship, and public assembly.
* **Industrial** sector includes facilities and equipment used for manufacturing, agriculture, mining, and construction.
* **Transportation** sector includes vehicles that transport people or goods, such as cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, trains, aircraft, boats, barges, and ships.

All global energy markets revolve around these sectors. With Petroleum (Oil for the Canadians) providing roughly 37%, Natural Gas 32%, Renewable 11% (kewk), Coal 11% (Trump 2020), and Nuclear at a dismal 8%. Honestly, side note why the fuck are homes still heated on Nat Gas, Electric and not Nuclear? Idk im retarded. Wait its because Nat Gas and Oil are big swinging dicks in this bracket. For those keeping score thats +1 for Globalism and Capitalism, Science and Commies 0.

&amp;#x200B;

Data is a bit dated ;) at 2015 but its the best we got from the EIA

So moving along here you see Nat Gas and Electric as make up about 80% of the market. What provides that you ask?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ut1wcxdp4u261.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76628660c9fba96d72f3f01ebb405cf83977bb41

Wait first lemme blow this up so we can all see

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lvs5qrnq4u261.png?width=193&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f6c1fcb8806c531cf9d0538d58616f10c1c8a52

Ok now, 44% of homes are heated with Natural Gas based energy which is highly efficient only consuming 16% of Nat Gas reserves, while 41% are heated by relying on the power grid; which is powered with an additional 36% of the United States Nat Gas. So in total United States homes consume about 52% of US Nat Gas markets.

Here is an [article](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=45716) from the EIA starting to expect greater consumption this winter than in previous years. Posted Nov. 2, 2020

Within this article, they state we should expect consumers to spend 6% more on their winter bill than last winter (lockdowns in cold climates were already in effect, for some of the winter)

Moving on to transportation and oil markets, 91% of transportation is powered by oil. Think, global shipping lines, domestic holiday shipping, domestic general goods shipping, and the biggest contributor that provides all of these things, airlines. Personally, Im staying out of this portion due to a diverse set of market forces acting on global shipping markets. Tanker gang rises up tho.

Screenshot from EIA [article](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/natural-gas/where-our-natural-gas-comes-from.php) is shown above has Texas and Pennsylvania produce almost 40% of our Nat Gas

In conclusion and with the understanding that, United States Nat Gas companies out produce all other nations what are the tickers you want to look at?

EQT- Largest Pennsylvania based Nat Gas producer technical point to price spike maybe $25 EOY (just the start of winter)

PXD- Largest Texas-based Nat Gas producer $160 EOY

XOM- I didnt look into oil production vs Nat Gas but the largest Texas-based. $50 EOY

Title: Undervalued Companies Generator
 Howdy! I've been trading since March and investing for a few years, so up to you to completely ignore this post - also first time posting here I think.

Anyways I've found some success finding undervalued companies by searching random companies onto Yahoo Finance and seeking the analyst ratings (Undervalued to Overvalued, with a % Estimate Return), and maybe this can help a few traders out by skipping on the FOMO stocks and looking for long term investments that have expected returns that can outperform the market.

**The Game Plan to Start**

So I firstly start off by going to [https://www.randomstock.net/](https://www.randomstock.net/) and looking for NASDAQ or NYSE stocks, and then I go to Yahoo Finance and enter the ticker and try and determine if the company is undervalued based off the analyst ratings and I also look at their EPS, PE, Dividend Yield. Then I look into the statistics of the company - Profitability (Profit margin + Operating Margin, also to determine growth after dividends). I also take a look at the financials, if they beat their earnings, annual and quarterly revenues/earnings, total revenue, gross profit and net expenses.

**Additional Platforms for confirmation**

After you look on Yahoo Finances, you should also then go onto other brokers and platforms to find other analyst ratings and results, I personally go to Webull for my Undervalued Watchlist. On Webull you can also take a look at the recommendation ratings, analyst target prices and then the support/resistance and overall trend for the company (as well as short, mid and long trends that are forming). You can also use Schwab and Morningstar to get additional ratings, you can use the ratings on Schwab as well as Schwab's grading, based on the companies Growth, Quality, Stability, Valuation as well as Sentiment.

**Fundamentals after Technicals**

After all of this and I see that the company can be sustainable, I then take a look at the brief and sector the company is in, I'd personally check out their website, what products they have, company origins, average volume, growth potential and how it would react to market reactions, this kind of indicates how it performs compared to competition. Macro news is essential for this type of investing, could either make or break the growth of the company - but as this is a much longer investment you can create very lose trailing stop losses, whatever your exit plan is.

**Advantages of this 'strat'**

Honestly I've found great success with this, it's a fast and efficient way of analyzing professional forecasts on the companies growth, and by using multiple platforms it helps as a confirmation that the company has room to grow. This is a pretty straight forward way of getting companies to watch on the side when you're bored, or to actually implement yourself.

It's also great for traders not looking to get into FOMO stocks, it could potentially even land you a safer position in a future FOMO stock and get a great entry price.

**TL:DR -**

Type random symbols into yahoo finance until you find a great deal :) Takes you like 5-10 minutes to find a nice one. Obviously not for experienced traders, but it's a nice boost to help new guys! Thanks for reading!

Title: Real DD from a Structural Engineer
[Worst Day for PLTR](https://www.reuters.com/article/palantir-tech-stocks/update-1-palantir-stock-sees-worst-day-since-going-public-idUSL4N2II3OL)

Logic dictates that Stonks only go up. Therefore if today is PLTR's worst day it can only go up from here . Is just facts. Prove me wrong.

Title: I work for a top-5 bank. My company just announced the creation of a CDO (chief data officer) at the executive level, specifically for enterprise data management. They directly mentioned implementing data management technology in the future. 2021 PLTR shares looking bright to me  Buy and hold 
Yeah so my company is fairly old and immobile, but they love money. The creation of an executive position for data management from a top-5 (Canadian) bank is big news, but that they mentioned partnering with data management tech is **huge** news for the industry. Trend is your friend and PLTRs tech only has one way to go 

Title: Why is no one talking about RKT of we're trying to go to the moon?


Title: DD + Position: Why PLTR will NOT fail
Listen up, Autists and Coomers.

Palantir cant shit the bed, because the government requires their technology for spying and killing little brown kids while playing barefoot soccer in dirt patches.

Everyone here is overthinking this while I am the only whale of a genius applying Occams Razor.  This is literally the Panopticon of surveillance, answering to the whim of the government's esoteric questions about people movement and data.


Puts or calls, theyll print. Just set your dates and sentiment straight.


Position: 250 calls, 12/18 30C

Title: Vaccine Analysis and Assesment
Vaccine Analysis and Assesment

2 vaccines does in 30 days for maybe 1 year of protection. And you can still get infected during that time.

Per math, 253 vaccinations to prevent 1 infections, 10 million doses only provides 5 million immunizations, resulting in a prevention of only 20k infections.

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EmezgmAXMAMCDBT?format=jpg&amp;name=large

And then youre gonna have to dose everyone again in 1 year or less. Itll be a continuous thing. And then you have possibilities of mutated versions which im not gonna get it into.

HOWEVER, Vaccine Lipid shell durability vs time shows rapid decrease in effectiveness after 180 days.

https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1525001618303174-gr4.jpg

4 doses of vaccine per person per year is not feasible.

Title: PLTR may never be this cheap again
Seriously. I just bought more at 21.95. This isnt some archaic video games brick and mortar store (I own GME too and am losing buckets so dont give me shit). Palantir has tremendous tailwind growth and isnt going ANYWHERE with its government contracts. Also, expect ETFs and institutions to buy in heavily as this becomes part of the core public market beta exposure. BTFD!! 

Title: This week was rough for some folks and it's probably going to get rougher...
So a lot of folks just got wrecked in the first half of this week and a lot of folks are hoping for a rebound by the end of this week. I'm here to bring a reminder that it might only get worse. So our monthly unemployment report for the US is coming out tomorrow (and GDP report as well?). With November state shutdowns the unemployment numbers are going to rise:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/k150yg/another\_778000\_americans\_filed\_firsttime/](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/k150yg/another_778000_americans_filed_firsttime/)

We had big states like New York and California shutdown:

[https://ogletree.com/app/uploads/covid-19/COVID-19-Closure-and-Reopening-Orders.pdf](https://ogletree.com/app/uploads/covid-19/COVID-19-Closure-and-Reopening-Orders.pdf)

[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html)

Now am I saying that you should sell all your calls, shares and start buying puts?

No, no one knows the exact number atm and we don't know how the market will react. We might have a September dump (granted we had stocks ATH and due for a correction) or the market might just shrug it off. But please plan ahead and have some exit strategy just in case.

or just continue to buy more pltr because sToNks ONly gO uP

Title: Why is no one talking about the possible government shutdown over the stimulus on December 11th?
Dems sent McConnell a proposal that he denied on Monday, and it doesn't look like there will be a bipartisan agreement on the liability of businesses being open during the pandemic. That, paired with the rise in COVID cases coming from thanksgiving and I think a spy tank is SERIOUSLY imminent if the government shuts down due to no second stimulus agreements. The last government shutdown over the wall back in december 2018 to january 2019 caused spy to drop from 265 to 235 in a matter of days leading up to the shutdown. If there is no positive new on second stimulus come next monday, I fully expect to see the same thing happen.

Trust me, I'm not a hairy gay bear, but I don't know how anyone isn't thinking or talking about this. Dems and the GOP hate each other right now more than ever, and I do not expect them to come to an agreement on a second stimulus.

Seriously. SPY Dec 31 330p or VXX Dec 31 20c

Title: Elon Musk: Tesla Full Self-Driving beta to expand in two weeks
If the FSD comes out it means the stonk is gonna drives itself to the moon.

Title: Time for you retards to load up on HOME:
This is for people who are looking to diversify from NIO and PLTR or want to make beaucoup bucks in general. HOME is a winner in the making and it is a must cop before it explodes.

**Info:**

* Company name: At Home
* Ticker: HOME
* Why I think it is a monster stock:
   * At home consistently delivers high teens net sales growth as their net sales increased 19.3% to $318.7 million from $267.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 driven by the net increase in open stores.
   * The beat expected EPS by $0.11 with an actual EPS of $0.74 in Q3. The company has a history of being profitable and making smart decisions.
   * Currently they have 219 locations worldwide and have the capacity to expand up to 600 locations worldwide.
   * At Home has the potential to be a leader in the home decor space and can definitely be a $100+ if you buy in.

**My Opinion:**

* This is a real stock, not one of those stocks you retards keep pumping without strong financial backgrounds. This isnt speculation, its actually legitimate. Theyve been crushing it with online sales, and Christmas is just around the corner. What does that mean? . Adding on, the vaccine is IMMINENT. Physical retail is back, and the only thing that means is . I know a lot of you guys are retarded but if you dont see the easy 100% growth this has, youre not even worth my time. Will **easily** be at $30 by EOY and $40 by March 2021 *LATEST*.

Title: Wsb mods are feeding the algos
So informed autists knows that Roblax is now known as s-e-a-r-s, but surprise se-ars is now a ban ticker from wsb? Why, simply cause the algos are feeding from the retard juice flowing out of the subs like the theta vampire that they are. Tell me u/zjz why is se-ars banned when we know clearly well that we aint talking about a retail bankrupt chain? This sounds like manipulation of manipulation, like trump saying to stop the count when biden is leading, this just show how stupidly rigged you guys are with this ipo.

Title: PLTR Dec 2nd
It is truly remarkable to see PLTR drop...so many paper hands scared of these big bad ! Like I said in a previous post, my broker is a head executive at our branch in Seattle and he had no idea what Palantir was until I brought it up 1+ months ago. Dont be afraid by this correction, youre falling right into their trap! A big  trap! Poosies are mad they missed out on the first run. 

Position: 1,152 shares at $27

Title: Copper is the new gold
Not sure why nobody is talking about copper here but it's red hot right now and is entering a commodity super cycle.

* China (uses half of copper in the world) has recovered from the pandemic fully and has imported record amount of copper this year

* People speculate on EV companies like crazy but regardless of which EV companies end up dominating the market and which ones go bankrupt, copper wins.  Each electric vehicle uses 3.5 times more copper than combustion vehicle.  An electrical bus uses 11-16 times more copper than a conventional bus.   Super charger stations needs copper.  Any green infrastructure will require a lot of Cooper.

Goldman thinks copper price may break the 2011 record by second half of 2022.  https://www.ft.com/content/36fe5230-e24f-4fbf-8690-fd211f655347

So what to buy wise, I looked through a dozen big cap producers and jr miners.  Most  mine too many other metals and some own a lot of copper underground but digging up maybe a challenge for environmental/political reasons.  What's left are FCX, SCCO, and HBM.

Back in 2010-2011 when copper price broken record last, FCX traded over $56 ($23.68 right now), SCCO traded around $46 ($60.38 now so maybe not cheap), HBM traded around $17 ($6.78 now).

I have been buying FCX shares for 6 months, just started buying options last couple days.  Right now I have

* 2000 shares of FCX

* 50 contracts of HBM Jan21 7.5C

* 50 contracts of FCX Jan21 30C

* 20 contracts of HBM July21 10C

That's over $50K of positions in copper producers but I may buy some FCX leaps soon too.  The 2021 options maybe more of a moon shot unless copper price spikes a lot sooner than expected.
