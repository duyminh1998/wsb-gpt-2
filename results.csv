Huge news, namaste has previously used an amazon style business model for thc/cbd products where they secure supply agreements with different companies and sell their products. 

With this license they received, they can now grow their own product, create their own brands, and VASTLY improve overall revenue AND margins.

I would write more DD but I‚Äôm at work, so check them out. CEO meni has a good head on his shoulders and has moved this company into the write direction over the last two years. Given
the hype in MJ stocks, this is going to be a huge winner over the next few months.

Got in after the halt at .44, holding until 2+. Keep in mind this was trading in the low 4s from the MJ hype in 2017/2018.

LaPulgaAtomica87,1613178102.0,1613156502,lii20e,DD,"TLDR: QQQJ will rocket over the next two weeks because some of its major companies like \*\*ETSY, ROKU, VIAC, TTD, ZS, BILI\*\* will be reporting earnings starting next week.  


I know a lot of you have got burned chasing meme stocks (GME, PLTR, AMC and weed) and you're looking for something ""safer"" to play now. Well, look no further than call options on QQQJ. It is attractive because:

1) Unlike QQQ which is overweight in big Tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials.

2) If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside in QQQJ than QQQ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ.

3) For options (the reason why 99% of you are reading this anyway), IV is still relatively low. Show me another ETF that has gone up 30% since November with IV in the 25-30% region. Premiums on QQQJ are ridiculously cheap. ARKK, ICLN, MJ etc have all gone up higher but check their IV and premiums.

4) My favorite reason for being in QQQJ: it is fairly consistent. On deep red days, it doesn't tank too much and on hulk-dick green days, it doesn't rocket like ARKK. It just reliably goes up gradually.

5) Why will it rocket even more in the next two weeks? Well the following companies will be reporting earnings: ROKU (18 Feb), TTD (18 Feb), ETSY (25 Feb), VIAC (24 Feb), BILI (24 Feb), ZS (25 Feb)

6) Call me conspiratorial but I believe market makers and hedge funds have been using WSB for their pump and dump schemes since we blew up. It's not impossible but it is harder to pump and dump an ETF. So I believe that makes QQQJ safer and more robust than some of the other plays circulating on here.

I predicted in December than QQQJ will hit $35 by March and bought a lot of June $35c options. My thesis was that once the constituent companies in the ET reported good, in some cases blowout earnings and provide optimistic guidance for the upcoming year (due to the vaccine ramp up and an actual competent administration), it should rocket up. However, looking at its current trajectory, it will hit $35 and surpass it by next week!!

Just something to consider as you chase meme stocks and ETFs with ludicrous IV and premiums. Have a nice day and make lots of tendies, brothers and sisters!  


My recommendation: Get options expiring in June and September with strike price between $35 and $40. Park your money there, delete Robinhood and check back in 3 months. But as always, do your own DD folks and be skeptical of everything you read (including this!!)",üöÄüöÄüöÄ QQQJ to rocket even more over the next two weeks üöÄüöÄüöÄ
DressMetal,1613178039.0,1613156439,lii12k,Discussion,"Now I can't bother to write an essay about it, so I'm not flaring this as DD, but here's my suggestion. Load up on dry bulk shipping stock.

Sector is booming strongly for a few months and is expected to go higher for the next few more. Dry bulk companies were severely undervalued due to periods of long depression the last few years.

Just today Diana had a 25% spike. Safe Bulkers a 12% and Star Bulk 15%. I expect this to go quite a bit higher. A couple days ago Castor had its day in the sun with a staggering spike, but these companies here are even better value, as they are well established, well managed and with large fleets.

Now keep in mind it is a volatile sector and some dry bulk stocks have been prone to manipulation before, so do your own research.

involutionn,1613176533.0,1613154933,lihgbz,YOLO,"I am god damn sick and god damn tired of all these pathetic newbies coming on here and taking away from the authentic WSB culture. Backing out of bets, selling after a dip, saying that we should actually do research before throwing our life savings into a play? It's fucking pathetic, disgraceful. I can hardly even fucking look at you half the time, you should all be ashamed of yourselves. 

Every day we stray further from god. What actually brought us to this point? What gave all these degenerates enough capital to lose 10x their inital investment on margin? What first united us as a clan when all the hedgies and stonk brokers said we were going down? What was there before PLTR, GME, SNDL or AMC? Tslsa, Tsla, Tsla, and Tsla. Tesla is the primordial ooze that binds us retards together and the road

To reinvigorate some WSB spirit, I've decided to do what I did last time after [taking a major loss](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhq2pa/cloudflare_earnings_overnight_play_good_ol/), YOLO the rest of my life savings into TSLA calls and make it all back. By the end of next week I'll be fine dining only the most prestigious tendies on a private jet or my kids will be eating cat food I paid for with a second mortgage on my house. There is no in-between, this is the way. Now for the three-for-one:

# Due Diligence

Tesla literally can not go down next week. It is physically impossible to stray below it's current price point. The timeless syllogism of Tesla is known as modus ponens 

Proposition 1: Stonks only go up

Proposition 2: Tsla is a stonk

Conclusion: Tsla only goes up, QED.

I know I've said it before but this literally cannot go tits up. It's like getting in at Gourds before they were a big hit. It's like that one dude who bought a lot of tranches or whatever the fuck before we knew about tranches. It's foolproof. ***Huge upside potential with very little downside.¬†Does that ring a bell?‚Äù***

# Bet

If Tesla closes Friday above $900 I will be getting a Tesla tattoo on my ass cheek. 

If Tesla closes Friday above $1000, that tattoo will be the size of a small watermelon. 

Don't you dare even insult me by even asking if I'm going to follow through, I am. I'm not like these pussies who fake their bets harder than their wives fake their orgasms. You bet your sweet ass I will follow through.

This morning the gods revealed to me a DD that perplexed and amazed me. I did not know the meaning of many of the words and phrases they used, but it sounds very intelligent.

That said here‚Äôs why GEVO is nice and I‚Äôm holding it for the long term.

GEVO are going to be making carbon neutral jet fuel. Pretty nifty coz I‚Äôm pretty sure people are already paying extra to airlines to fly lower carbon flights, and I‚Äôm sure governments all around the world will be heavily incentivising low carbon footprint fuels.

They‚Äôve secured funding now for their Net-Zero 1 project which will use entirely renewable energy sources to refine 45MGPY of bio-fuels which have a net zero carbon footprint. They already have in place contracts to sell 48MGPY at 1.5 billion over the life of the contracts. After this they‚Äôre looking to introduce projects net zero 2 and 3 as well as a bunch of other cool, useful shit that lets us revolutionise the world without reinventing planes and shit.
